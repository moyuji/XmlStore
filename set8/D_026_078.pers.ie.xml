<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/> The mad fanaticism that now rules the hour would extinguish this fire by feeding it with more fuel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>They would pour fire upon the conflagration instead of water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>They would save the <rs>Union</rs> through the very agencies by which the <rs>Union</rs> has been destroyed, or most seriously endangered. --They would strengthen the fabric of the <rs>Constitution</rs> by repeated assaults upon the foundation.--They would instruct men how to amplify and preserve their own liberties by sanctioning the annihilation of the liberties of their neighbors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>They would violate <num value="1">one</num> part of the <rs>Constitution</rs> in order to preserve another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>Many of them, in their patriotic zeal, are very much like <persName n="Roche,Sir,Boyle,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00053" reg="default:Roche,Boyle,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Boyle</foreName> <surname>Roche</surname></persName>, in the <orgName n="British Parliament" type="parliament">British Parliament</orgName>, &#x0022;who was willing to give up not only a part, but, if necessary, the whole of the <rs>Constitution</rs> in order to save the remainder.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/> We doubt whether, if all the mad houses were let loose, there could be mustered such a collection of incomprehensible and mad theorists as now have control and are shaping the policy of this unfortunate Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>If these men think they can calcine ice out of gunpowder and make silk out of cobwebs, or bottle up sunlight to let out upon their gardens in inclement seasons, I have the right of calling in question the system of reasoning by which they have brought their minds to such absurd conclusions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/> I know that the question is time and again propounded, through what avenue can we arrive at a settlement of the grave issues of the hour, save through a vigorous prosecution of the war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>I answer, not through the agencies of continued war, certainly never through war embittered by the exasperating and insane legislation of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>The plan of conciliation of the ruling powers seem to be that of the infamous <rs>Duke</rs> of <persName><foreName>Alva</foreName></persName> toward the unhappy <rs>Netherlander</rs>, to make every Southerner feel as he lays down at night or rises in the morning, that his house at any hour may fall and crush him. It would seem really, to read the debates in the <name>Senate</name>, and <name>House</name> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, as if these bodies were endeavoring to revive the spirit and transactions of <persName><foreName>Alva</foreName></persName>'s. &#x0022;Council of Blood.&#x0022; The experience of <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> of this species of policy still finds, as every sane man knew it would, the <rs>Southern</rs> armies in the field, strengthened in numbers, more effective by discipline, and breathing hate and defiance embittered by a policy pursued toward them that has no warrant except in the practice of the most barbarous nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>A continuance of such a war and such a policy must only widen the breach, and render separation certain, and reconstruction impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>If asked how I would propose to settle the issue of the hour, my answer would be that of <persName n="Burke,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00054" reg="mostcommon:Burke,nomatch:0"><surname>Burke</surname></persName>, in the <orgName n="House of Commons" type="government">House of Commons</orgName> in <dateStruct value="1775--"><year reg="1775">1775</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>From the commencement of the breaking out of the rebellion in the colonies against the mother country, <persName n="Burke,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00055" reg="mostcommon:Burke,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Burke</surname></persName> directed a most diligent attention to a plan of conciliation, as involving the primary interests of a great empire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>By maintaining a constant intercourse with many of the enlightened characters of the different colonial provinces, he acquired a more extensive and intimate knowledge of the physical and moral condition of the colonists, with their real views, disposition, and resources, than was attained by any of his contemporaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>The result of this investigation was a decided conviction that he boldly announced through every stage of the controversy, that the exasperated feeling which existed in the colonies could only be allayed, and their alienated attachment revived and fundamentally secured by placing them exactly on the footing they stood previous to the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>If the men who now clamor for peace, and <unclear>p</unclear> if not granted, were traitors, so was <persName n="Burke,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00056" reg="mostcommon:Burke,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Burke</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>The national life of the mother country was just as much endangered there by the existence of the rebellion, as it is now. And yet no man in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> who had any reputation dared to charge <persName n="Burke,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00057" reg="mostcommon:Burke,nomatch:0"><surname>Burke</surname></persName> and such states men as <rs n="Fox" type="nativeamerican">Fox</rs>, <placeName reg="Chatham, Kent, England" key="tgn,7011586">Chatham</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7013927" n="1.000 10" reg="Pittsburgh, Allegheny, Pennsylvania">Pitt</placeName>; <persName n="Barre,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00058" reg="mostcommon:Barre,nomatch:0"><surname>Barre</surname></persName>, Lutterell, Ponnall, and others who sustained his views, as traitors, disloyal to the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>He desired peace because it could have been had then without the dismemberment of the empire; for, as he foretold, a few more years of war and the peace would have to come, but with the loss of the very colonies to which the ministry had held on with such a death grip. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/> &#x0022;My proposition,&#x0022; said this bold commoner, &#x0022;is peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>Not peace through the medium of war; but peace to be hunted through the labyrinths of negotiations; not peace to arise out of universal discord fomented in all parts of the empire; not peace to depend on the judicial determination of perplexing questions, or the precise marking of the shadowy boundaries of a complex Government &mdash; It is simple peace sought in its natural course, its ordinary haunts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>It is peace sought in the spirit of peace, and laid in principles purely pacific.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>I propose, by moving the grounds of difference, and by restoring the former unsuspecting confidence of the people in the mother country, to give permanent satisfaction to your people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>I mean to give peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>Peace implies reconciliation, and where there has been a material dispute, reconciliation does imply in a manner concession on the <num value="1">one</num> part or the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>In this state of things the proposal I make bold to affirm ought to originate with us &mdash; The superior power, wrong as the colonies may be, or you think they may be, can offer peace with honor and safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>Such an offer from such a power will be attributed to magnanimity; but the concessions of the weak are the concessions of fear.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/> The words of wisdom were not heeded by the vigorous prosecution of the war politicians of that day; and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> lost her colonial possessions by the same blind obstinacy, shortsightedness, and insane vanity that may yet destroy this Union, and secure the final independence of the <rs>Southern</rs> section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>Admitting that our arms had been attended with all the success which the most sanguine advocates of the war have flattered the country with, had the <rs>South</rs> been disposed from their defeats and suffering to sue for peace, what city of refuge has been open for them, what horns of the altar could they take hold on and be saved?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>What explicit terms short of degradation and dishonor worse than death have been proposed to them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>What security (innocent and guilty) that they should not be treated as a conquered people and subject to whatever yoke their haughty victors might please to impose upon them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>It would be madness to expect that men who had taken up arms so defiantly, and struggled so courageously as the <rs>South</rs> have done, should throw them down and submit to their conquerors, especially when they had so little to hope and so much to fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>The only hope can be, and this now, to my mind, is the faintest possible, in a change of system.--Reverse all these absurd and pernicious measures that for <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> have characterized northern legislation; for if the confidence and affection we have lost is ever to be regained, it can only be by giving the <rs>South</rs> the most undeniable proofs that we wish not to oppress them; that we are willing to remove every ground of complaint, and to afford the amplest security for the enjoyment of all their constitutional privileges in the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>I waive all questions of authority and right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>With nearly a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men slain or rendered useless, with a frightful debt of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of <num value="1000000">millions</num>, increasing at the rate of <num value="2000000">two millions</num> a day, and national ruin and bankruptcy, the inevitable consequences of this dreadful war, peace, speedy peace, should be our object, and to accomplish this a repeal of those obnoxious legislative acts is demanded, which are an insurmountable bar to reconciliation, and have lost us the confidence and good will of those who might have been really kindly disposed towards us in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>What greater folly can there be than to expect to force a people into a friendly union with you, to intrust their rights once more into your hands, and submit their property and lives to your Government by desolating their country and spreading famine and death over their land?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>And what are the laurels acquired in this destructive warfare?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>We have subdued not their armies, but the small remains of their affection so the country, their reverence for its laws, and their confidence in its generosity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>Neither the men in power, or the mere pensioners of the hour who now cowardly sustain them and their policy, ever attempt to reason from the analogies of history.--We told them at the outset of the impracticability of their task, and we tell them again that their failures in the future will be even more stupendous than they have been in the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>Ignorant of the actual resources of the <rs>South</rs>, they supposed that a <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> blockade would starve every man, woman, and child into submission, and that an army of <num value="75000">seventy-five thousand</num> men would be sufficient to conquer and hold the entire Southern region.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>We told them that they would want a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men and spend <num value="1000">thousands</num> of <num value="1000000">millions</num>, and yet only be upon the edge of their fearful enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>Nearly <num value="2000000">two millions</num> of men have been called for, and over <num value="2000">two thousand</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num> spent it and who is there, having the slightest <unclear>lly,</unclear> that does not know that <unclear> </unclear> <hi rend="italics">the rebel armies are more defeat and <unclear>dangerous</unclear> than ever, and may provost the war for <unclear></unclear></hi> to the utter and complete ruin of both sections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>The public credulity however, is still unbounded, and it will go on trusting and being betrayed, as it has been for the last <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, by a set of knaves whose <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> only object is to fatten upon the public plunder that such were engender, and to rise in the scale of wealth a their country's honor and prosperity sink.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>The day will come, however, when a betrayed people will take ample vengeance upon the mock patriots who have deceived them to their ruin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>There never yet was a civil war that was not followed by a counter revolution, in which ample atonement was demanded for the crimes, and from the criminals that had engendered it.--These men may escape, being influenced by the effect of logical conclusions; but, thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, they cannot forever escape the penalties of their infamous crimes and oppressions, and <hi rend="italics">that hour is nearer at hand than some of them imagine.</hi> </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/> We allude to an occurrence which transpired in <orgName n="San Francisco California" type="newspaper">San Francisco, California</orgName>, where a Government official obtruded himself upon a meeting called for the purpose of protesting against the passage of a law by the <name>Legislature</name> placing greenbacks upon a par with gold in point of value, but was forced to seek safety in flight from the popular indignation that was aroused against him on account of his unwarrantable interference; and to another in <placeName reg="Lancaster, Fairfield, Ohio" key="tgn,2080293">Lancaster, Ohio</placeName>, where the establishment of the <hi rend="italics">Eagle,</hi> a paper devoted to peace principles and to Democracy, was destroyed by soldiers, instigated by Abolitionists, in retaliation for which outrage the <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs> arose, and attacked and gutted the dwellings of the leading fanatics of the town. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>And yet there is something more terrible even than this to contemplate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>It is the paralyzes of a great people struck dumb and motionless in the presence of a gigantic despotism &mdash; fearful to speak, lest some hired minion of the prevailing and abounding tyranny shale strike the audacious utterer down &mdash; fearful to write the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> gifted thought, lest press and writer fall under the ban of mailed and gauntleted power &mdash; fearful to move, lest same tole bearing informer shall whisper a suspicion of disloyalty and treason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>To be assured of its entire justice, we need only revert to the fate of the aborigines on this continent and in the <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550">West India Islands</placeName>, to the gradual disappearance of the natives in the <rs>Polynesian Archipelago</rs>, and to the utter extinction of many nations mentioned in the <name>Scriptures</name> and in the earlier <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName> writers, of whom not a trace is left, although they appear to have been, for number, in their day, like the sands of the sea or the stars of the firmament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>Without some special relation binding them with the tribes among whom their lot has been cast, they eventually end by making those tribes disappear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>That relation, so far as these Con- <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> federate States are concerned, is the relation of master and slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>Wherever that tie has been dissolved by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, the law of nature, as announced in Revelation, has immediately begun to make its operation conspicuous.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> see the necessity of establishing some kind of relation with the negro race, if they would avoid exterminating it utterly, as clearly as we do. For master and slave, however, they propose to substitute a system of general amalgamation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>Under the title of &#x0022;Miscegenation&#x0022; (amalgamation) a tract, supposed to have been written by a beastly woman named <persName n="Dickinson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00147" reg="mostcommon:Dickinson,nomatch:0"><surname>Dickinson</surname></persName>, who lectures nightly on this odoriferous subject at the <orgName n="Cooper Institute" type="institute">Cooper Institute</orgName>, in New York, has carried all Yankeedom by storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>From the account given of it by a correspondent of the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName>, we take the writer to be no bad specimen of a Pasiphae, with propensities only a little more beastly, and her readers not far behind her in a taste for bestiality in general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>This woman assumes that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> race is decaying from thinness of blood and dryness of system, and that the only certain way to elevate it is to engraft upon the negro stock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>She speaks in rapturous terms of the rich <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> blood which is thus to be infused into the dull veins of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, regenerating and reinvigorating all the energies of the old race, and imparting new vigor and new energy, to which it was a stranger before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>Nor does she labor alone in this &#x0022;sacred&#x0022; cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>All these things are beastly to the last degree, or which amounts to the same thing, they are genuine <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>, and would be tolerated nowhere but in Yankeedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>There, however, the sentiment is almost universal, or at least is fast becoming so. The pamphlet to which we alluded above says the new race, thus compounded, would be the most perfect race the world ever saw.
