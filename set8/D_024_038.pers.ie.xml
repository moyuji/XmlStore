<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> --In reply to your communication of the <dateStruct value="--29"><day reg="29">29th ult.</day></dateStruct>, I have to state that on the afternoon of <date value="04-22">April 22d</date> a signal was made from the <term type="ship">flag ship</term> <rs type="ship">Hartford</rs> for all commanding officers to repair on board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Though not positive that the signal was intended to apply to the officers attached to the mortar flotilla, I determined to present myself in obedience thereto, which I accordingly did. I found assembled all the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officers</rs> of the fleet, with the exception of those attached to the mortar flottile, myself being the only representative of that branch of the squadron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Upon repairing to the cabin of the <rs type="role" reg="flag-Officer">flag-officer</rs>, I was laughingly told that I was looked upon as an outsider, and that the signal was not meant for me. Perhaps it would have been more delicate in me to have retired but as I felt that the object of the meeting had a common interest for all, I determined to remain, supposing that no objection to my presence could exist admitting that there was no necessity for it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> The <rs type="role" reg="flag-Officer">flag officer</rs> then proceeded to state the reason why the officers had been summoned, which was to give his plan for passing the forts, and the disposition be proposed to make of the forces under his command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>He premised by saying that <persName n="Porter,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="nearbymention:Porter,D.,D.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Porter</surname></persName> had submitted a plan of operations which embraced ideas similar to his own, and with which he entirely agreed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>He then continued to state his plans, and invited the opinion of the officers there assembled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The prevailing feeling seemed to be adverse to making the attempt to pass the forts at that time; that it was premature; that the forts had not been sufficiently reduced by the fire of the mortar vessels, and that the risk of the loss of many of the vessels was too great to be run. --The question was freely asked, why the mortar vessels could not continue the bombardment for a length of time; the idea of which appeared to be rather indefinite, unless it was expected that the reduction of the forts should be owing to the force of the mortar vessels entirely, when the ships would be able to pass in comparative safety. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> The <rs type="role" reg="flag-Officer">flag officer</rs> said he agreed in the main with what had been said; but that <persName n="Porter,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="nearbymention:Porter,D.,D.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Porter</surname></persName> urged very strongly the attempt being made, not only on the ground of its probable success, but from the fact that the fire of the mortar vessels could not be sustained for a much longer period; that the ammunition was becoming scarce and difficult of supply, the vessels shaken by the constant concussion, and the men fagged out with a continued bombardment, which had already lasted for more than <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure> and <num value="3">three</num> nights; on these accounts the <rs type="role" reg="flag-Officer">flag officer</rs> said he had determined to make the attack the same night. * * * * * </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> In conclusion, you ask my opinion whether you were justified by results in advocating so strenuously the advance of the fleet, and what might and would have been the result had your counsel, which was deemed premature, been disregarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Having been more intimately associated with you, and probably more conversant with your plans and expectations than any other in the squadron, I am enabled to say that the brilliant result most completely vindicated the wisdom of your counsel and the soundness of your views.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>By the light of knowledge obtained subsequent to the surrender of the forts, it is plain that delay in the attack would have been fatal to us. Had the defence been as vigorously and gallantly conducted by the naval portion of the forces opposed to us as it was by the army, the chances are that the mortar vessels would have been obliged to retire before the fire of the iron-clad <orgName n="Battery Louisiana" type="battery">battery Louisiana</orgName>, which was to have taken up baraking position below the <orgName n="Water Battery" type="battery">water battery of <placeName key="tgn,2335522" n="1.000 10" reg="Fort Saint Phillip, Plaquemines, Louisiana">Fort St. Phillip</placeName></orgName>, and under the protection of the guns of both forts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Fortunately for us, the supineness of the rebel naval officers left us undisturbed; but it cannot be conceived had the attack been delayed a day or so longer, that the enemy would have fulled to make use of so formidable an adjunct to his means of defence. </p> <closer> <salute>I am, with great respect your ob't serv't,</salute> <lb/> <signed>(Signed) <persName n="Wainwright,,J.,M.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="default:Wainwright,J.,M.,,"><foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Wainwright</surname></persName>,</signed> <lb/> <signed><rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant Commanding">Lieutenant Commanding</rs>.</signed> <lb/> <rs type="role2">Commander</rs> <signed><persName n="Porter,,Daniel,D.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="default:Porter,Daniel,D.,,"><foreName>Daniel</foreName> <foreName>D.</foreName>  <surname>Porter</surname></persName>, U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/> The most complete excoriation which these sinners have ever received is in the late address of <persName n="Stiles,Reverend-Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00221" reg="mostcommon:Stiles,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Reverend-Doctor">Rev.

All the denunciations they receive seem to whet their appetites, and the groans of their victims, like the whistling of the winter's wind to people seated around a comfortable fire, heightens their own enjoyments by the force of contrast. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/> A contemporary observes that mankind are always fond of considering themselves ill-used, and ever ready to lay the blame upon the wrong shoulders; which he illustrates by the outcry against speculators, when the really responsible parties, those whom we ought to abuse, are the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>This is certainly the keenest and bitterest thrust that those robbers and murderers have received during this war. We have heard a good deal of pleasant sarcasm at their expense, and have exhausted our own vocabulary of hard names long ago, but we knock under to our ingenious contemporary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> responsible for the crimes of the speculators!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>We thank our contemporary for discovering a new point of resemblance between the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> and the <name>Devil</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>The Devil, who has vileness enough of his own to answer for, is often charged by sinners with being the responsible agent in their rascalities, when he had just as little to do with them as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have with the price of wheat, corn, and potatoes!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>No doubt many men are tempted by the <name>Devil</name>, but there are a good many <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> rate villains who require no temptation, and find him a great convenience in accounting for their transgressions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are monsters enough to starve us to death if they could, but they can't; whilst <hi rend="italics">the speculators can and are doing it,</hi> and then lay the blame upon the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>!. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/> In sober carnest, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have no more to do with the enormous prices of articles of prime necessity than the man in the moon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>It suits the self-delusion of speculators to lay all their sins upon the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, but there are no <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> more mean, mercenary, and devilish, than the hypocritical wretches who are eternally bawling out &#x0022;<rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>,&#x0022; to divert attention from their own robbery, murder and treason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>Those hideous crimes which <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> practice upon their enemies in war, they practice upon their friends in peace &mdash; picking their pockets, starving them to death, and exposing the <rs>Southern</rs> cause to greater peril of destruction than the combined armies of Yankeedom. </p>
