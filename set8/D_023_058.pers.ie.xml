<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>This effort succeeded, and our brave sharpshooters retired through the orchard in good order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>So soon as they got well out of the way we opened upon the enemy, and in <measure n="10minutes" type="date">10 minutes</measure> they skedaddled in fine style, sheltering themselves in the ravines and behind the barn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>The guns, from the nature of the ground, were very close together, and it was almost impossible to distinguish the discharge of the guns, in your own from those in other batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>It was clear that the next <measure n="30minutes" type="date">thirty minutes</measure> would determine the fate of all our batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>At the same time the enemy made his infantry advance, he commenced a most furious cannonading.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>No sound was heard for <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> from this time but the roar of cannon and the bursting of shells.

An attempt was made to turn our right, but the brave <rs>Sigel</rs>, with his trusty <rs n="German" type="group">Germans</rs>, and the batteries he knows so well how to man&#x0153;uvre, was at once ordered to the right, and the enemy was driven back with heavy loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>After this a desperation was fearfully evident among the rebels, and there soon emerged from the dust a long, solid mass of men, coming down upon our poor, worn-out army at a bayonet charge on the double quick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>By the description of those who saw this line of bayonets, I am <sic>stisfied</sic> that in the distance it must have presented a spectacle at once awful, sublime, terrible, and overwhelming. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/> On came the demons, as if emerging from the earth, in well caparisoned my <unclear></unclear> reaching in solid column as far as the limit of human vision.--But we were fully prepared to meet the onset properly, and our men stood, pale but full of courage, awaiting the result, fully determined to die, nobly fighting for the <orgName n="Stars and Stripes" type="newspaper">Stars and Stripes</orgName>, if die they must; and they saw no safety in retreat. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/> Perfectly astonished at the confidence and courage of our men, the rebels came up handsomely, within good range, and, taking our fire, a semi-orderly commotion was observed in their ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>While this encouraged our men, <persName n="Pope,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00111" reg="nearbymention:Pope,John,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Pope</surname></persName> saw what was the intent of it all. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/> Almost as quick as thought the bugles sounded the order to the rebel phalanxes, and instantly the huge mass of rebels was hurried against our <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/> Very triumphantly the rebel hordes advanced.--* * * It was evident, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> glance, that they had been heavily reinforced, and it was equally impressed upon our consciousness that we must meet the approaching contest with men wearied enough in body and not a little dampened by the thought that <persName n="Sumner,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00114" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,nomatch:0"><surname>Sumner</surname></persName> and <persName n="Franklin,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00115" reg="mostcommon:Franklin,nomatch:0"><surname>Franklin</surname></persName> had failed to come up.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/> The day was far advanced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>Our men had fought with more than mortal heroism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>Inspired valor flushed each eager countenance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>We had suffered severely in killed and wounded; but few of our number had been taken prisoners &mdash; the fighting was too desperate, and the field too hotly contested on both sides to prevent any yielding save in death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>The bravery (for I scarce know what else to call it) of the rebels must be admitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>Many of them had thrown aside their coats and jackets, and entered the contest with an <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> dash and recklessness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>Many of our men had not a mouthful to eat since morning, but there was no indication at any point in our line either of wavering or weakness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/> It was whispered along the ranks in the pauses of the conflict, when the reverberations of the cannon, hushing momentarily, allowed an articulate shout to be heard, that <persName n="Franklin,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00116" reg="mostcommon:Franklin,nomatch:0"><surname>Franklin</surname></persName> was coming to our aid from <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/> The rebels seem <num value="3">three</num> to our <num value="1">one</num>, when cheering is heard in our rear, and the dust rises in clouds seemingly for miles in extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>Many of them sank right down, and, cooled by the rain that was falling, were soon fast asleep, dreaming of home and all that is lovely and beautiful in life, while the rear of cannon was still ringing loudly in their ears, stupefied with the sudden relapse from the extraordinary excitement of the past week. </p>
