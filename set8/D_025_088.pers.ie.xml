<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> The dull monotony which has prevailed in camp since our arrival in front of <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> was relieved yesterday by a bombardment of the enemy's works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Several of our longest range guns were placed in position &mdash; some of them on the side of <placeName reg="Lookout Mountain, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100143">Lookout Mountain</placeName> &mdash; and a slow but regular fire was kept up from <time value="11oclock">11 o'clock</time> in the morning until <num value="5">5</num> in the afternoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>This fire was maintained at intervals during last night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The guns put in position on the side of the mountain were the <num value="20">20</num> pounder <name type="weapon">Parrotts</name> of <persName n="Alexander,Colonel,E.,P.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="default:Alexander,E.,P.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Alexander</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Chief of Artillery">chief of artillery</rs> in <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The enemy replied to our fire from <num value="3">three</num> points only &mdash; their extreme left up the river, the star fort in the centre, and the moccasin works on their left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>These last works are on the north side and in a bend of the river opposite our left, and are so designated because the ground in the bend of the river assumes the shape of an <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian's</rs> moccasin.--They are in the lower part of the S which sweeps around towards our lines at the foot of Lookout.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The ground in the moccasin is elevated and irregular, and gives the enemy an enfilading fire upon a column moving across the <unclear></unclear> against their centre or right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>There are <num value="3">three</num> casemate batteries of rille guns on the moccasin, and they are known among the <rs>Confederates</rs> as the moccasin batteries. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> The Star fort is situated about the centre of the <rs>Federal</rs> lines, and is an extensive and formidable work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>We have not yet been able to ascertain the number of guns it mounts, though we could see that <num value="4">four</num> of its guns replied to our fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>None of their guns, however, were able to reach our batteries on the mountain, on account of their great elevation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> The distance was too far for our guns to produce any particular effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Several of our shot were seen to explode above the <rs>Star</rs> fort and over the <rs>Federal</rs> lines; but as far as I could see, with the aid of an excellent glass, no unusual commotion was created thereby in the camps of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The men moved in an orderly manner to their positions in the forts and behind the breast-works, and stood firmly to their posts throughout the day. A few of our <num value="12">12</num>-pounder howitzers were placed within <placeName><distance reg="1200yards">twelve hundred yards</distance> of the <rs>Federal</rs></placeName> lines, but the guns chiefly relied upon were not nearer than <num value="2">two</num> and <measure n="2.5miles" type="distance">two and a half miles</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> Our casualties were few and slight, not exceeding <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6" type="wounded">six wounded</measure> from shells.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The enemy doubtless suffered a heavier loss, inasmuch as his troops were more closely massed in an open plain. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> The freshet in the <rs>Tennessee</rs>, produced by the late <measure n="30hours" type="date">30 hours</measure> rain, carried away the enemy's lower bridge, night before last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>This was a hastily constructed trestle work, slight and frail, the pontoon bridge being higher up the river, and opposite the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Several parties were out yesterday in flats and batteaux trying to save the wreck of the bridge, but they met with indifferent success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The enemy has secured a small steamboat &mdash; probably <num value="1">one</num> that had been plying up the river from <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> &mdash; and this they are using as a ferry boat. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> A deserter, who swam the river yesterday and delivered himself up to our pickets, says that a report prevailed in their camps that our cavalry had destroyed between <num value="4">four</num> and <num value="500">five hundred</num> of their wagons with their contents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>He says also that the <rs>Federal</rs> suffered very much for food for a week after the <rs n="Battle of Chickamauga" type="battle">battle of Chickamauga</rs>, but that they were now receiving full rations, a supply train having arrived. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> With the exceptions noted above, no change has occurred since the date of my last letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>There is still some doubt felt in regard to the reinforcements alleged to have been received by <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>My own opinion is that additional forces have been received, and that the time has passed when we could hope to force <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> out of <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, except by a flank movement upon <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>, or the destruction of his line of communications to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>Some portions of this gentleman's remarks were well worthy the reputation of our greatest statesmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>He deprecated the very prevalent disposition to undervalue our currency, and thought that the best thing which could have been done in the start would have been to have made Confederate money a legal tender, and impose a penalty of confinement in the penitentiary on any <num value="1">one</num> who refused to recognize a Confederate or State note as of equal value with <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>The practice of allowing substitutes had been of incalculable injury to our cause, and, in the speaker's opinion, was unjust to the great mass of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>The extortioners were handled without gloves, and the large number of well dressed and well fed <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> refugees skulking about this city, who had come over to Dixie from patriotic motives, but were unwilling to shoulder a musket in defence of the <rs>South</rs>, were also dealt with <unclear></unclear> they deserved.

<head rend="smallcaps">Confederate currency and credit.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/> The depreciation of the <rs>Confederate</rs> currency, and the train of evils which flow from it, have occasioned very deep concern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>The <orgName n="Virginia Legislature" type="legislature">Legislature of Virginia</orgName> directed its attention to the subject immediately it assembled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>The <orgName n="Finance Committee" type="committee">finance committee</orgName> of that body has had it under consideration and has consulted the financial officers of the <rs>Government</rs>, the presidents of the banks, and experienced commercial men, as to the best means to remedy those evils, already so grievous, and which threaten still greater inconvenience and distress. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/> We learn upon good authority that this committee has taken into favor a scheme framed by a prominent bank officer of the city (we may say <persName n="Macfarland,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00212" reg="mostcommon:Macfarland,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Macfarland</surname></persName>) which has for its object the diminution of the <rs>Confederate</rs> paper circulation, the stop page of the manufacture of paper money by the <rs>Government</rs>, and the resort after a time exclusively to taxation and the sale of bonds to meet the <rs>Government</rs> expenses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>A scheme that will achieve those important ends will be hailed with satisfaction by the whole country, and must confer the greatest benefits upon the people and the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>It is simple enough, but needs the concurrence of capitalists and the public to be carried into operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>It is a proposed loan of <measure n="200000000dollars" type="currency">$200,000,000</measure> to the <rs>Confederacy</rs> by the people and the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>For instance, the quota of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, some <measure n="40000000dollars" type="currency">$40,000,000</measure>, is to be made up of <measure n="25000000dollars" type="currency">$25,000,000</measure> by capitalists, and <measure n="15000000dollars" type="currency">$15,000,000</measure> by the <rs>State</rs>. --The State's part to be raised by sale of bonds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>It is assumed that such a loan to the <rs>Government</rs> will enable it to stop its manufacture of notes, and to gradually curtail its circulation:--its large revenue from taxation, and its liberal receipts from the tax in kind, keeping it,--favored as it will be by a very great reduction in the cost of everything from a reduction of the amount of its circulation &mdash; so nearly supplied with means for the war that it can readily sell its bonds to meet the deficit. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/> Whether or not the scheme will achieve this much cannot be known with certainty until it is tried.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>But it meets with the approval of some of the wisest financiers and bankers in the <rs>State</rs>, as well as some of the soundest political economists; and there should be no hesitation to try it. It cannot fail to improve greatly, and most opportunely, the circulating medium, and consequently to diminish most advantageously to the people and the <rs>Southern</rs> cause the cost of living.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>If it should not do all that is expected of it, it will, beyond all question, do this, and therefore it would amply reward the country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/> The question is, will capitalists agree to invest a part of their immense gains during this war in Confederate bonds?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>If they will do so the <name>States</name> will promptly do the part allotted to them in assisting the <rs>Government</rs> out of its difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>Every argument of self-interest, as well as patriotism, appeals to them to rally at once to the support of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>If the public credit is maintained they secure their large profits against the day of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>If it is not, they will lose them irretrievably in the gulf of repudiation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>We have not room to elaborate the arguments &mdash; such as the enhancement of the value of the credits they hold, so that they, in fact, part with nothing in lending to the <rs>Government</rs>; the reducing of the prices of all necessaries; the restoration of confidence; the encouragement of industry, and the establishment of cheerfulness and contentment in lieu of discontent and distrust in the public mind &mdash; We are enlisted in a cause dearer to us than life; for we peril our lives in it. --Does the man of means prize his money more than he does the blood of his children and relatives?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>Then let him make good his riches by helping to sustain the credit of the <rs>Government</rs> and purify the currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>If he thinks more of his country &mdash; If he considers the life streams of his own offspring dearer than the savings from his industry or his speculations &mdash; he will freely give these last to his country to help it in the prosecution of the war, that it may be terminated at the earliest day and with the greatest economy of the precious blood and the treasure of the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>Every man who has a dollar to spare should give it heartily with some of these motives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>Be he miser or patriot &mdash; a devotee of mammon or a true <name>Christian</name> and loyal citizen &mdash; he should not hesitate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/> The proposition, we anticipate, will be laid before the <name>Legislature</name> at an early day. It is <num value="1">one</num> that demands the promptest and most serious consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>To be of service it must be speedily put in force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>The evils it is proposed to remedy are growing with fearful rapidity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>The circulation must be diminished &mdash; the system of meeting public expenses by manufacturing money must be checked or terminated, or affairs will arrive sooner than we imagine at a dead lock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>The war cannot stop, indeed; but ruin will come upon the country in its financial matters, and distress will fall heavily upon all classes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>What will become of the speculator?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>He cannot escape the storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>He must lose all as well as other people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>Reduce the circulation &mdash; make <measure n="1dollars" type="currency">one dollar</measure> worth as much as <num value="7">seven</num> are now &mdash; reduce by consequence the cost of living &mdash; and you have also, by consequence, increased supplies, which will be better diffused &mdash; improved industry &mdash; better spirits amongst the people &mdash; added energy in the public defence, and renewed vigor and determination everywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>The crisis demands an effort to accomplish all this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>No man is true to his country &mdash; no man is true to his own interests and his own honor, who with holds his influence and his efforts from these objects at a time like this. </p> </div3>

It seems to have been so far as we can learn from contemporary history, anything but Divine; quite human, in fact, and very indifferent human, to say the least of it.
