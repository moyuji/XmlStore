<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The latter lay so close in shore, in shallow water, that our steamer found it impossible, owing to her heavy draft, to get as near as she would.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>At <time value="5.5oclock">5&#x00BD; o'clock</time> the firing ceased on both sides; at <measure n="15minutes" type="date">15 minutes</measure> to <time value="6oclock">6 o'clock</time> small boats were seen to pass from both monitors to the <rs>Atlanta</rs>, and a wooden gunboat down the sound was signalled to return, which she did.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>They think she was clearly so when the firing ceased, and perhaps bilged, as her pumps were actively at work, and she appeared soon after the surrender to be careening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Another solution of the affair is that there was treachery among the crew of our vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>They start at the point which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> attains only at the expense of a long and painful system of training.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>It is perfectly easy for the <rs>Southerner</rs> to maintain his superiority, provided only he be determined to do so.
