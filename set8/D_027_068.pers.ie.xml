<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The &#x0022;situation,&#x0022; in a military point of view, everywhere remains unchanged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>We give below such items of intelligence as were received yesterday: </p> 
<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head>From <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> While the bombardment of the city was progressing on <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct>, there was considerable skirmishing and cannonading in front, which, about <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time>, increased to a brisk artillery duel, gradually extending along the lines, and for <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>, from the right of the plankroad around to the river, an uninterrupted roar of cannon was heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The opposing lines of pickets have lately been more demonstrative than usual, and at times within the past <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> the interchange of leaden compliments has been very frequent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The shelling of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct>, as we have before stated, was <num value="1">one</num> of the most vigorous bombardments of the campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Shells of different sizes were thrown into the town at the rate of from <num value="10">ten</num> to <num value="20">twenty</num> per minute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/><persName><foreName>Mary</foreName></persName> little damage, however, was done. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> The only movement of the enemy, perceptible within the last few days has been an advance of his picket lines, which have occupied a portion of the <placeName reg="Vaughan, Nicholas, West Virginia" key="tgn,2120310">Vaughan</placeName> road; and a corresponding advance has been made this side of the <rs type="place">Davis house</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> It is said that the object of the wanton destruction of the <rs type="place">Davis house</rs>, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>, was to revenge the capture of so man. <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> pickets at this point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>We do not see how the infliction of an injury upon a private citizen can compensate for the loss of men; but such is the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> mode of conducting the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> Deserters report that the <measure n="15inch" type="distance">fifteen-inch</measure> mortar with which the enemy has been shelling the city recently, bursted a few evenings ago, killing <num value="20">twenty</num> men.--The statement is doubted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> There was some shelling yesterday, and some picket fitting on the lines; but beyond this, nothing of importance occurred. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>There is probably no truth in this statement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>This committee got together on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> and attempted to discharge this duty.--They found it no easy task.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>With their efforts to get together, it was found that words meant too much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>The ultra peace faction finding that they were unable to get their ideas embodied in a straightforward way, labored for the next best thing that they could accomplish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>The other side, finding that there would be a bolt if they insisted upon a platform which perfectly suited their notions, went to work to make it as harmless as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>That of armistice especially troubled them, and a long contest was had in reference to adding a resolution interpreting its meaning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>During that session it was directly charged in debate that a portion of the committee were purposely trying to delay their action in hopes of bringing about a combination to change the whole result of the <rs>Convention</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>The excitement as the hour drew near was intense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>The approaches to the room were densely packed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>The delegation sat with closed doors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>Every person who came out of the room was seized upon by the eager and excited multitude to find out the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>Betting was freely indulged in by the ultra peace men. For <measure n="5hours" type="date">five hours</measure> the delegation remained in caucus, the intelligence now and then being conveyed to the outside that they were simply talking.--Finally a vote, which may be considered a rest vote, was announced on the question of tabling a motion of the anti-McClellan party, which.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/> The caucus broke up without taking a vote, <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> was, therefore, another exciting day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>Again the belling commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/> Thus the contest went on.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>Thus foiled, <persName n="Harris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00106" reg="nearbymention:Harris,John,,,"><surname>Harris</surname></persName> of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, and Long, of <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, were then got hold of and were prevailed upon to denounce <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00107" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> in the <rs>Convention</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>This was the last resort of the ultra peace faction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>Upon that they based their success or failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>Their dodge was to denounce him in every way possible, and to prevent a nomination on <dateStruct><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct>, in hopes that, through the feeling that they might arouse against &#x0022;Little Mac,&#x0022; they could secure sufficient change in front during the night to prevent his nomination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>They succeeded in preventing a ballot that evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>Night having overtaken them, and there being no way to light the building, they were obliged to adjourn. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/> Then came the private manipulations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>The game of brag was once more commenced, but it did not avail them anything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>About midnight it became apparent that instead of weakening <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00108" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s strength it had the reverse result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>It concentrated and riveted it more firmly together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>The effect was just what the <rs>McClellan</rs> men wanted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/> &#x0022;No that has been clearer since the commencement of this war than that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, above all other people on earth, know best how to magnify the slightest advantage into a complete victory, and to varnish over a rout so as to make it appear an insignificant repulse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>This was particularly the case in the account of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00187" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s repulse on the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>, <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00188" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>'s complete defeat at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, and Hocker's rout at <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName>, to say nothing of the tremendous whippings (as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> papers say) which our favorite <persName><foreName>Ulysses</foreName></persName> administered to <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00189" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> in the battles and skirmishes from the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> to the front of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="Wednesday evening's Whig:"></bibl></cit>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/> If the writer of this article had added that, notwithstanding all the experience we have had of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> mendacity, they are still able, by the most transparent lies, whenever we gain a victory, to make our people believe that it was we, not they, who were defeated, he would have told the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>Not <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> ago the whole <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation was in an agony of despair on account of the tremendous losses which they had sustained during the campaign of the <rs type="season">spring</rs> and <rs type="season">summer</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>A small advantage gained by them at a single point elevated them at once to the <num value="7" type="ordinal">seventh</num> heaven of exultation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>The most enormous lies, the most extravagant boasting, and the most extraordinary efforts to create a public opinion in favor of continuing the war, were immediately resorted to. They had the effect which we foresaw they would have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>They created a perfect <hi rend="italics">furore</hi> in the <rs>North</rs>, and cowed and intimidated us to a degree which we were amazed to witness, accustomed as we have been, for many years, to mark the fluctuations of public opinion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/> And yet, upon reflection, the cause of this sudden despondency is easily understood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>The mind is never so deeply dejected as at the period which immediately follows an unusual elevation of the spirits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>The people had been indulging the hope that peace was near.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>They were taught to believe it by those who should have known better; and believe it they did. That ill-omened Congress of self-constituted diplomatists at the <rs type="place">Falls of Niagara</rs> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> produced the impression, and, as it was an agreeable impression, it was impossible to eradicate it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>We endeavored to convince the public that it was so; but the delusion was pleasant, and they could not bear to resign it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>While the public mind was in this state the reverse at <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> took place, all Yankeedom was in a blaze of excitement, all ideas of peace were at once abandoned by our amiable foes, and nothing but blood and rapine could any longer satisfy their appetites.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>Instantly the hopes of our people fell from the zenith to nadir; and as their expectations were altogether without foundation, so their dejection became utterly irrational. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/> The inconsiderate hopes which have been so largely indulged in this instance have had a very mischievous effect in directing the minds of men from the only subject which, at present, ought to occupy them, namely: the prosecution of this war with the greatest possible degree of vigor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>Nothing is so enervating as the disappointment of highly-wrought expectations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>Let us hope that these cries of peace, peace, at a season when there is no appearance of peace, will be discontinued for the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> must be defeated in their object so often as to learn that it is wholly unattainable, and that they are wasting their blood and their money in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>They will come to this knowledge slowly and much against their inclination.--But come to it at last they both will and must.--Even now <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00195" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> tells them that but for the <num value="200000">two hundred thousand</num> negroes whom he has stolen and converted into soldiers he should long since have been compelled to give up the war as a hopeless undertaking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>The negro soldiers, then, are all that stand between us and the attainment of our independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>So far as these recruits have given us a taste of their quality, they do not appear to oppose any formidable barrier; and when we shall have removed it, such as it is, the war will be at an end. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
