<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>He alluded to the momentous question which the <rs>Convention</rs> was called upon to decide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Appalling as he considered the terrors of civil war, he learned that we were approaching a state of degradation much more to be dreaded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Though there were conservative men in the cities of the <rs>North</rs>, yet in the great heart of that section there was no indication of a change of sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>He conceived that unless the <rs>Union</rs> could be planted upon the immovable rock of justice, the sooner it was overthrown the better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>We had a right to demand full security from the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Our constituents, it was true, desired moderation, but they wanted an heroic moderation, which would demand everything that was necessary and accept nothing less.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>He looked upon it as a matter of regret that the <rs>State</rs> had lost a great opportunity for fame, by hesitating so long in making her demands; but he made no imputation upon the spirit of the people, because various considerations conspired to make them wish to linger in the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>But the <rs>Union</rs> was now shattered; <num value="7">seven</num> sisters had left, and established a new Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>He thought it no subject of reproach that they did not wait for Va.; and he vindicated them from the charge of rash precipitancy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>It was common to say that Va. had more interest in question of slavery than the <rs>Cotton States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>He took issue on this question, and went on to argue that our interest was not comparable to theirs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Territorial expansion was with them a necessity, and their position on the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> rendered them more open to aggression than the position of the <rs>Border States</rs>.--<rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs> was only nominally a slave State; <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, would soon be free States; while to the <rs>South</rs>, slavery was the vital element.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The hope of a reconstruction of the <rs>Union</rs>, through any amendments to the <rs>Constitution</rs>, he considered utterly futile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Those men who had been sleeping on the sand-banks at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, hourly expecting a terrible collision with the <rs>Federal</rs> troops, could never be brought back, except through a bloody revolution at home or subjugation by a foreign power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>They were able to sustain themselves, and would never relinquish the experiment of self-government unless by the application of over-whelming force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The Northern people would not tempt them back, nor could they force them back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>A statement had been made by the most conservative <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> journal at the <rs>North</rs>, that unless there was some change in the <name>Morrill</name> tariff, the <rs>Government</rs> would be bankrupt before the next crop of corn was ripe; and should <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> unite her destinies with such a Government?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>If the majority report of the committee was adopted, there was no security that peace would continue for a month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Then what would the condition of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> be, with no opportunity to unite with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, her own soil, perhaps, to be the battle-ground, and troops concentrated by the <rs>Federal Government</rs> on her borders?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Was this Commonwealth to submit to the decision of a <orgName n="Border States conference" type="conference">conference of the Border States</orgName>, if she went into it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>A great majority in such a conference would represent States that could exist without slavery; and he could see no good to result from it, even if <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> proposed to acquiesce in its decision. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> The question now was, where would <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> go &mdash; whether she would go with the <rs>Southern States</rs>, or remain with the <rs>North</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>To go nowhere, means to remain with the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>He did not propose to discuss the subject of the material interests of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> as connected with the <rs>South</rs>, which had been so fully and thoroughly shown by the gentleman from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>He went on, however, to demonstrate the evils that would lay waste to the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> in a Northern Confederacy; the exodus of her citizens to the <rs>South</rs>; the decrease in the price of public lands; the augmentation of her public debt; the loss of trade and political power; while, in the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, he argued, all her material interests would be promoted.--All her former political influence would be restored, and she would give weight to the <rs>South</rs>, both at home and abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>None of the lights of civilization, he conceived, would be extinguished by the downfall of the <rs>Union</rs>.--After discussing some of the general questions of the slave trade, he alluded to the argument advanced by the <rs>Union</rs> men, that a large standing army would be necessary to protect our border.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>He thought this phantom would vanish after they had carefully investigated the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The large standing armies of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> were maintained because the people had not the control of <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> their own destinies, and to prevent them from getting the reins of government; to keep them in fear and subjection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>This country had a great <placeName reg="Canadian River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7019930">Canadian</placeName> border, dividing us from a great military power, and there was no necessity for a standing army there; the people on this side slept in entire security.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>He did not believe there was any reason to apprehend an invasion of our border; if it should be, the patriotic people of <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName> would meet the invaders with a force that would strike terror to their hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>An invading army might approach by railroad to the very verge of the border, but when they crossed, an obstruction, placed upon the track by a patriotic hand, would throw car loads of soldiers into eternity.--They could only advance by the slow progression of other days; and the electric fire of the telegraph would communicate the news of their approach, and a mighty host would be prepared for resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>A living wall would be formed, impassable by any invading army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/> The speaker made an eloquent appeal to the <rs>West</rs> to come up to the rescue of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> from the hands of her oppressors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>In glowing words he depicted the event of a war between the <rs>General Government</rs> and the seceded States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/><placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> would not then with-hold the sinews of war from her sisters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/> As much as he loved the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>, (said <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> H., in conclusion,) rather than see her deviate from the path of glory marked out for her, rather than see her forsake the principles of the fathers, he would forsake their ashes, and say, &#x0022;Where Liberty dwells, there is my country.&#x0022; When he remembered that the flag which had been so eloquently alluded to on this floor now waved over a power at <placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 4" reg="district of columbia">Washington</placeName> that seeks our destruction &mdash; which might wave over the ruins of peaceful homes in our sister States, and be borne at the head of armies marching on to desolate our provinces &mdash; he would have <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> turn from it with indignation, and remember that the true colors of the country were the spirit and the principles which animated our fathers to resist tyranny and repel aggression. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>He was satisfied that there was some applause on the floor of the <rs>Convention</rs>; but the members had adopted rules for their own government, and he had no right to go beyond those rules.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/> The <rs>Chairman</rs> said his duty required him to enforce order in the hall, and this would be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>He was perfectly satisfied that there was as much disturbance on the floor as in the gallery, and having been appealed to by several gentlemen to withdraw the order, he took pleasure in doing so; but cautioned the spectators to refrain from such demonstrations hereafter. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>After a brief allusion to the sentiments uttered so eloquently by the gentleman from <placeName key="tgn,2002137" n="1.000 2" reg="albemarle, virginia, united states">Albemarle</placeName>, which had moved the hearts of the multitude, he said he recognized this <sic>assemblge</sic> of <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginians</rs>, called to deliberate upon measures to secure the rights of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>, as an august assemblage, and he most earnestly joined in the prayer &#x0022;for light&#x0022; that had been so devoutly uttered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>He claimed for the county which he represented the right to be heard in this assemblage of <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginians</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>He did not claim it because of the historic associations to which the gentleman from <placeName key="tgn,2002137" n="1.000 2" reg="albemarle, virginia, united states">Albemarle</placeName> had alluded, but claimed it for the people of the county of <placeName key="tgn,2002142" n="1.000 53" reg="augusta, virginia, united states">Augusta</placeName> as a living, acting body of men. That county he might term the <placeName reg="Queen county">Queen county</placeName> of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>In point of population, wealth, position, variety of productions and pursuits, and in every particular, she claimed the consideration of this Convention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>She was identified with every interest of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>; and if there were extremes of opinion or prejudice in <num value="1">one</num> quarter or another, <placeName key="tgn,2002142" n="1.000 53" reg="augusta, virginia, united states">Augusta county</placeName> knew nothing of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>She occupies a central position, and is concerned in every question that affects the rights and interests of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>. --What, he asked, is the great question which concerns us here, and threatens to overturn the mighty fabric of a free Government?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>He wished to discuss the question as bearing upon <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>'s rights and <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>'s honor; and from that stand-point he could see but <num value="1">one</num> single complaint so far as she was concerned, and that was the course of the <rs>North</rs> upon the question of <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>From the earliest foundation of the <rs>Government</rs>, <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> had given direction to its policy; and when it has not been in the hands of her own sons, it has been in the hands of those of her choice, supported and ratified by her people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>This was not only true in regard to the <rs>Executive</rs>, but she has had a controlling voice in all the other departments of Government. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/> In all this he saw enough to show that the <rs>Government</rs> had been administered to her satisfaction, and therefore the only cause of complaint was the agitation of the slavery question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>This had been discussed by able and eloquent gentleman on this floor, and he asked if any man had heard a reference to other grounds of complaint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>He understood gentlemen to acquiesce in this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>Thus we have it confessed that in all else that concerns the great interests of <num value="30000000">thirty millions</num> of people, the <rs>Government</rs> had been administered to the satisfaction of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>He could not put out of mind the apprehension that on this great question <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> was divided; the apprehension that there were some people in this State, and some on this floor, who were not to be trusted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>This was not new to him &mdash; he had heard it for years; not from abroad, but the charge came up from the midst of our own family.--He had seen it resorted to for the baser ends of party &mdash; not only <num value="1">one</num> party, but all. It had the effect of hounding on fanaticism against us in the councils of the nation, under impressions disseminated by our own citizens &mdash; an impression that the people of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> were not true to <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, but were divided and distracted in regard to her highest interests.--It would seem as if this were resorted to now as a species of terrorism, directed at the representatives of the people of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, in the vain hope of repressing, if not the freedom of thought, the freedom of speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>He trusted that, in defining his position, he should not defer in any respect to a clamor which he despised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>He hoped to show, with candor, in which particular light he viewed what was for the honor and interest of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/> He had always held the opinion &mdash; and had never had to undergo a change such as had been described by the gentleman from <placeName reg="Orange, Essex, New Jersey" key="tgn,2065747">Orange</placeName>, and had not, therefore, perhaps, the fresh zeal of a new convert &mdash; that <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slavery was right; a right thing and a good thing, on every ground, morally, religiously, politically and economically &mdash; a blessing alike to the slave and to the slaveholder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>He was not <num value="1">one</num> of those who looked forward to its extinction, nor did he look with sympathy upon any attempt to restrict it to a particular locality.--When it could be fairly done, he hoped it would expand until it covered the whole earth, as the waters cover the great deep.--The people who sent him here with this avowal on his lip, might, he thought, be considered as sound, a little further South.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>He represented a slaveholding constituency, who in men and money could compete with any county in the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>, and they held it all ready, at any time, to defend this great and vital interest. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/> He would undertake to say that on the slavery question, the mouth of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> was completely estopped as to the charge of a want of proper legislation on the part of the <rs>General Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>He defied any gentleman to put his finger on a single act, in any Department of Government, from its foundation to the present, that did not, at the time or afterwards, receive the sanction and approval of the people of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>This he asserted to be true, and he challenged contradiction. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/> After elaborating upon this point, he alluded to the expressions on this floor in regard to the degradation of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and said he burled such an imputation back with scorn and contempt. </p> <milestone unit="column" n="3"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>On the action of this assemblage depended more, in all that concerns the weal or woe of man &mdash; in all that concerns the high destiny of a free people &mdash; than was ever before committed to any assemblage by mortal man.
