<head>Our defensive policy.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/> If the <rs>South</rs> is pleased with the defensive policy, there is certainly <num value="1">one</num> point of agreement at any rate between the belligerents &mdash; The <rs>North</rs> approve it heartily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>That section has the rare and agreeale excitement of being at war and at peace at the same moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>It has not heard in all its borders from the beginning of this conflict <num value="1">one</num> hostile gun, it has never known an evil of war save its financial embarrasements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>Its fields are safe from the tramp of hostile squandrons; its firesides are never quenched in blood; its dwelings and towns do not light the sky with fearful conflagrations; its women and children are not in fear of being shelled out of their houses or of suffering barbarities worse than death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>They enjoy the luxury of reading, in their comfortable parlors, accounts of the inflictions of these calamities upon the people of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, with no such uncomfortable drawback as the faintest dream of retaliations upon themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>They are, therefore, in the vein to cheer on the war beands with the most enthusiastic alacrity, and to enjoy the gaieties of life with even more than ordinary gusto.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>We are not, therefore, surprised to see brilliant accounte of the splendor of Presidential levees in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and the roystering fun and frolic of the <rs>New York Park</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>There is a charming exhilaration in the sport of throwing stones at the frogs in a pond, who, unhappy creatures, have not the ability to reciprocate the compliment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>The more pusillanimous a race, the more delightful is a combat in which there are Hows to give and none whatever to take. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/> We may fancy in our ignorance and blindness that war to be effective must be aggressive as well as defensive, and that the best way to overcome an antagonist is not merely to parry his blows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>In all encounters between men and man, and in all other wars that we have ever heard of, such a thing as striking back is considered not only honorable, but expedient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>Whether such a process will excite an enemy to fresh indignation, does not usually enter into the calculation of fighting men, and, if it did, it is a question which must depend upon the character of the adversary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>Without derogating from the martial capabilities of the <rs>Northern</rs> people, we incline to the opinion that an agressive warfare against them would stir up quite as much apprehension as rage, and that they infinitely prefer a kind of warfare in which they read of battles in newspapers, and have nothing to do with them personally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>They boast that they have now in the field an army of <num value="700000">seven hundred thousand</num> men, raised almost entirely since the period when it became evident that this war was to be on the part of the <rs>South</rs> strictly defensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>Whether that number has been raised or not, it is certain that they have placed in the field all who are willing to go and have exhausted their exchequer in efforts to carry on the war. Their spirit and their energies have risen in proportion to the immunity of their own soils and homes from danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>Their newspapers have been more belligerent, and their politicians more truenlent, as they have discovered that the hostile foot of the <rs>South</rs> is not to be planted on their own territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>If they had the means, they would carry on the war at least as long as <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> carried on the war against the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> colonies for <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> herself was not more secure from an <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> invasion in the <name>Revolution</name> than the <name>Norht</name> is from the <rs>South</rs> in the present contest. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/> We trust that with the opening of the spring campaign the enemy will be made to feel fast there are blows to take in this contest as well as blows to give.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>We have given the defensive plan a fair trial, and have seen its results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>A larger number of our gallant soldiers have perished by disease in camp and hospital then we could have lost by a march from the battle field of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> to the city of <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>Hernceforth, we must make up our minds that this is war, and that for every drop of Southern blood which has been shed, and for every hour our soil has been polluted by the footsteps of invasion, we will have compound interest in laying waste every accessible foot of Northern territory with fire and sword. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head>The glorious fight at <placeName reg="Reanoke Island">Reanoke Island</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/> If there is any other people but the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> on the face of the earth who would exult over such a victory as that at Reanoke Island, we know not where they are to be founed, nor do we know in what other nation except our own, such a defeat, under such circumstances, would be regarded in any other light than as a victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>From <num value="50">fifty</num> to <num value="100">one hundred</num> ships and <num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num> men, after <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> hard fighting, compel a little hand of <num value="2500">two thousand five hundred</num> to surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>Our men contended against odds of nearly <num value="7">seven</num> to <num value="1">one</num>, to say nothing of the ships, and they fought with a valor never equalled on this continent, and not surpassed in the most heroic days of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName> and <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>We may regret most bitterly that the common precaution of providing a way of retreat from such overwhelming odds was not provided, and that our chivalrous and noble defenders are now in <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> hands; but their honor and that of thier country is unhurt, and the moral effect of theri conduct ought to add fresh hope and spirit to the <rs>Southern</rs> cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>We have just as much confidence in the superior military aptitude of our men this moment as we had at the <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">battle of Manassas</rs>, and the balance of successes is still largely in our favor. --Whenever the enemy advances to the interior and forsakes the cover of his ships, he is sure to be beaten, provided always that we have <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> worthy of the men, and that they are guided by a skill equal to their courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>We have never yet suffered from the incompetency of the rank and file.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>Wherever they have been ably officered, they have won the day; and that has been the case in the great majority of the battles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>It cannot be denied, however, that there are a few incapables among our military leaders, and the sooner they are weeded out the better. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/> But there are scores of men in the town who make it their business to spread their own base and miserable apprehensions through the community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/> The authorities ought to take this subject in hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>Sumptuary laws are in general improper and odoius, but in times of great public emergency like the present, the sale of ardent spirits ought to be suppressed as a measure of public safety and military discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/><measure n="3miles" type="distance">Three miles</measure> is already laid with the best T rail &mdash; The whole route from <placeName key="tgn,2112496" n="1.000 4" reg="keysville, charlotte, virginia">Keysville</placeName> to <placeName reg="Clarksville, Montgomery, Tennessee" key="tgn,7015659">Clarksville</placeName> is cleared of timber, and abundant still are cut and sessored, and lying all along the line, ready for use. The only hilly and rugged portion of the route has been graded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>On the balance of the route the excavation now to be done is comparatively light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>The depots even have been in part constructed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>The road, in a word, is more than half complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>Prompt and energetic action would put the road in running order in <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>. The services of a man, known to the writer, competent to superintend the unfinished work and to push it to the speediest completion, can be had on the most reasonable terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>Negroes, slave and tree, can be had on terms more favorable than at any previous juncture in our history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>It is not unlikely, in view of the occupancy by the enemy of North Carolin a territory, that any number of slaves could be had from the coast counties of that State for the mere keeping, provided assurances were given that their labor should be appired to the patriotic important, and necessary purpose of constructing this road, and thereby of connecting the <rs>Atlantic</rs> seaboard of both the <name>Carolinas</name> with our Confederate capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>But, in any event, the requisite labor can be had on the most favorable terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>With Confederate or State Tressury notes to the amount of <unclear></unclear>, the completion of this invaluable work would be secured to the people within the brief space of <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>. Thus a railroad link would be made, whereby through freight and passengers could be transported from <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName></persName> on, <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">S. C.</placeName>, to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond, Va.</placeName>, without break of bulk as to the former, and with scarcely a transfer of baggage as to the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>The statements here made are <unclear></unclear>--they are <hi rend="italics">important</hi> truths.--They are grates so plain and of such import in this present national crisis, that we dare impute to the photic authorities, State and Confederate, after blindness and weakness not to see them and be controlled by them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>When the enemy already, by their bold assault at <placeName reg="Roanoke Island, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014345">Roanoke Island</placeName>, and by their still bolder advances up the <placeName key="tgn,2715022" n="1.000 335" reg="tennessee river, united states, north and central america">Tennessee river</placeName>, have notified us in the most unmistakable language that they mean, if possible, to break up and destroy utterly all the railroad cannexions between the different sections of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> when they have taught us by <num value="2">two</num> <unclear></unclear> and severe disasters that cutting us <unclear></unclear> on <unclear> </unclear> main lines of intercommunication is the poncy which they specially cherish, could be possible that a lesson taught by so dear experience, shall prove of <unclear>no utility</unclear> and of no effect? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/> The interests of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> and <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> especially, and yet scarcely less the interests of absolute <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, cry alend in this present emergency for the immediate complection of this half finished road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>It can be finished in a short time, at little expense, with an absolute certainty that it will confer inestimable benefits upon the whole country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>This appeal is made to the good judgment, <unclear></unclear>, patriotism, and prudent forethought of the <rs>Confederate</rs> and State authorities, with the hope that they will delay no time to do this work, so indispen-able to us all in the existing condition of public affairs.
