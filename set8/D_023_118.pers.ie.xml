<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>On Sunday a cavalry skirmish occurred some miles above the town, at a ford on the <placeName reg="Rappahannock, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1129010">Rappahannock river</placeName>, the enemy sustaining a repulse, without any casualties on our side. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> Yesterday morning they again advanced, and were met by our cavalry near the town, and a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time repulsed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>In this fight we had <measure n="1" type="killed">one killed</measure> and <measure n="3" type="wounded">three wounded</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>All these telegrams were immediately referred to the heads of bureaus, with orders to report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>It was ascertained that, in every instance, the requisition had been immediately filled, except <num value="1">one</num>, where the <rs type="role" reg="Quartermaster-General">Quartermaster General</rs> had been obliged to send from <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> certain articles of clothing, shoes, &#x0026;c., not having a full supply here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>Delays have occasionally occurred in forwarding supplies by rail, on account of the crowded condition of the depots, or of a want of cars; but whenever notified of this agents have been sent out to remove the difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>From all the information I can obtain, I am of opinion that the requisitions from that army have been filled more promptly, and that the men, as a general rule, have been better supplied, than our armies operating in the <rs>West</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>The latter have operated at much greater distances from the sources of supply, and have had far less facilities for transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>That all armies raised by Congress in any other way than by voluntary enlistment, are necessarily &#x0022;militia of the <name>States</name>,&#x0022; and to be commanded by officers appointed by the <name>States</name> alone, and not by the <rs>President</rs>, who has no power to appoint officers therefore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>That, in raising armies, Congress has no power to &#x0022;discriminate between classes,&#x0022; for such power, it possessed, is unlimited, and involves a power in Congress &#x0022;to disband and annihilate the <rs>State</rs> governments by conscription of all the <rs>State</rs> officers, executive, legislative, and judicial, whenever it may wickedly deem the <rs>State</rs> governments an evil or may, in its transition to imperial power, aim to destroy the <name>States</name>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/> It was manifest, on even a cursory reading, that the counsel for the plaintiff confounds these <num value="2">two</num> provisions: <num value="1">one</num> giving Congress power to raise armies; the other, the power to call out the militia to repel invasion, &#x0026;c. At <num value="1">one</num> view, it may appear that these powers are <num value="1">one</num> and the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>It is necessary to consider them carefully to arrive at a proper distinction between them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/> The <orgName type="regiment" key="8Section">8th section</orgName>, <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num> article, of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, enumerates the powers of Congress as follows: </p> <cit><q rend="inline"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/> To raise and support armies; to provide and maintain a navy; to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces; to provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws, suppress insurrections, and repel invasion; to provide for organizing and arming them, &#x0026;c., reserving to the <name>States</name> the authority to officer them. </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/> It will be seen that the <num value="2">two</num> clauses, <q>&#x0022;to raise and support armies,&#x0022;</q> and <q>&#x0022;to call forth the militia,&#x0022;</q> are not in juxtaposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>They are distinct. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/> The power to call forth the militia is for the purpose of repelling invasion, &#x0026;c. It is apparent that this power, in the emergencies enumerated, is intended to meet a sudden, pressing necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>It undertakes the <hi rend="italics">calling out</hi> an army <hi rend="italics">in addition</hi> to the grant to raise and support armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>In the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States Government</orgName>, after which our Constitution, in reference to carrying on war, &#x0026;c., is copied, it has never been the policy to have large standing armies enrolled and subject to central authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>Hence the framers of the <rs>Constitution</rs> thought proper to provide for emergencies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>These considerations force us to the conclusion that the <num value="2">two</num> powers are distinct, and so clear, it seems, that to state the position seems to prove it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/> But it is maintained that the conscription act is an attempt on the part of Congress to call out volunteers, and that it deprives States of the power to appoint officers, &#x0026;c. This point must be settled: Is this power exercised under the clause <q>&#x0022;to raise and support armies,&#x0022;</q> or <q>&#x0022;to call out the militia?&#x0022;</q> The only ground on which it can be applied to the last is that it takes the men constituting the militia.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>The <hi rend="italics">status</hi> of the citizen is not merged in the militia.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>The militiaman does not cease to be a citizen; and the conscription acts upon a population not as militiamen, but as citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>The policy of the militia law is so enroll the able-bodied men, though there might be many below and above the ages of whom militia duty is required &mdash; a <hi rend="italics">general rule</hi> being the object to attain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>If we are correct in holding that the <num value="2">two</num> grants of power are separate and distinct, and the power claimed is decreed to Congress, how are armies to be raised?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>What resource has it, but foreign hirelings, from which to fill up its armies?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>and from this humiliating resource we are shut out by the blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>The statute acts upon individuals as citizens and not as militiamen. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/> The next point is, that the power of Congress to raise armies is confined to voluntary enlistments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>The limitation does not appear on the face of the grant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>The power conferred on Congress as agent involves the duty to exercise it in the emergencies contemplated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>Is there an occasion at this time?--We are engaged in a foreign war &mdash; our country is invaded &mdash; not to redress a wrong &mdash; but a war waged with a degree of ferocity to force us to submission or extermination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>This is the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>There is, then, resting upon the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> the imperative duty to raise armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>Suppose volunteering has utterly failed, and to continue the war it were necessary to raise more troops; suppose, further, that the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities meet the issue with folded arms; could they justify this supineness by saying that the <rs>Government</rs> had gone to the limit of its power?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>The Confederate authorities, in pursuing such a course, would be recreant to duty, and would excite the indignation of an outraged people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/> Let us take a broader view, and look at the <hi rend="italics">object</hi> of States in forming the <name>Confederation</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>In its last analysis, it will be found to be the embodiment of strength, to deter other nations from encroachments, repel invasions, and redress injuries when inflicted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>If we could be assured that wars would cease &mdash; that man would no more war against his brother &mdash; in short, that the millennium was ushered in, we would say let each State stand upon its sovereignty; aye, abolish all government and all law, leaving each individual a law unto himself, Illustrating the principle of peace on earth and good will toward men. But, looking at the world as we find it, if there is any evidence of the approach of this happy era, it is in the old adage that <q>&#x0022;the darkest hour is just before day.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/> The object of Confederation being to prepare for <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> self-defence, in carrying out this end the entire war-making power has been transferred to Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>The States have no power to <q>&#x0022;raise and support armies,&#x0022;</q> and no agency in making or carrying on war, save in response to the <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num> clause of the <rs>Confederate Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>They are subsidiary agencies to the <rs>Confederacy</rs> in the exercise of these physical functions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>The intention is that the financial and physical resources shall be consolidated for the purpose specified that Congress shall devise means, and that the great mass of the people shall be subject to be transformed into soldiers whenever the necessity requires it. This is the object and the policy of the <name>Confederation</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/> If the <rs type="place">Court</rs> might be pardoned for using a solecism, Congress cannot compel voluntary enlistments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>And looking to the grant of power to Congress to call out militia, Congress cannot <hi rend="italics">compel</hi> Governors to call them out. The history of the <rs>Government</rs> from which we have separated gives us an impressive lesson on this point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>Several of the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> States held that there was no power to compel them to call out the militia to repel invasion, save of their own soil, and they refused to respond to the call for their quota of troops to aid in the struggle against a common foe. Whilst we tremble at consolidation and usurpation, and guard in all proper ways against them, let us not forget that there may be refractory Governors and too tardy Legislatures. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/> It cannot be shown that the power to raise armies was intended to apply to voluntary enlistments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>On this subject we are not without authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>Our Constitution is an exact transcript of the old on the points under consideration.
