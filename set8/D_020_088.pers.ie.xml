<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> --We stated yesterday our conviction that there would be no such thing as winter quarters during this war.--That either party will think of winter quarters, at least during the <hi rend="italics">present</hi> winter, is hardly probable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, at any rate, profess to have laid out a splendid programme for the season, and unless it should be spoiled by some unfortunate repetition of the <rs>Bull Runness</rs>, they will carry it out. They speak as if there were no doubt about the success of their plan, even in the smallest particular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The misfortune with them is, that combated operations upon so large a scale require a <unclear/> at the head, and talents in the general departments, which they are ill able to furnish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The troops must be veterans who will gand fire, not runners, who will trot off at the <unclear/> alarm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>A plan so vast and complicated as that which they propose, was never carried <unclear/> any commander, not even by <hi rend="smallcaps"><unclear>Napo</unclear> </hi> It is more vast than the invasion of <unclear/> in <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>It is more complicated than <unclear/> of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>It would <unclear>re</unclear> a superintending genius at least equal to <unclear/> of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,Louis,,,:1"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName></hi>--a man who had been <unclear>ac</unclear> to handle enormous bodies of troops Now, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have no such man. Old Scott never commanded <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> men in us life, until he undertook the conquest of the <unclear/> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName></hi> has the sort of talent <unclear/> required for fortifying a position, and <unclear/> a body of men behind the works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>It must be remembered, likewise, that this is a stem consisting of so many parts, that the casters of failure are indefinitely multiplied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The machinery is so ingeniously constructed <unclear/> no <num value="1">one</num> part can be independent of the last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The failure of <num value="1">one</num> involves the destruction of the whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>If <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName></hi> were a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> <hi rend="smallcaps">Napoleon.,</hi> he has no security that <unclear/> <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> have the capacity to comprehend <unclear/>views or his soldiers the courage to carry them out. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> Yet it admits of no doubt that a Southern campaign will be attempted, and the <rs>South</rs> should be prepared to encounter it. After a <unclear/> to the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName>, it still has men enough to defend its soil against any force the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> can send against it.--They may land at some unguarded point, as they did at <placeName key="tgn,3000601" n="1.000 10" reg="cape hatteras, dare, north carolina">Hatteras</placeName>, and may do some local <unclear/> We should be ready to guard against all such attempts as well as we can.--They boast loudly of their intention to seize, by means of their fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>They tell us through the <orgName n="New York Times" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName>, that they meant to do <num value="1">one</num> or all these things for the purpose of restoring the cotton trade to its <unclear/> channel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>They can as soon conquer <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and remove the <rs type="place">Sugar Loaf Mountain</rs> or the <name>Peaks</name> of Otter, to the centre of New York or <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>But they are raising men to effect this object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>It lies in fact at the bottom of the whole war. By a steady and persistent course of wrong and insult, they drove away this great trade, which made them what they are or what they were <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> ago. They now begin to experience the consequences of their folly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Their commerce has been curtailed to <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of its former proportions, their manufactures are gasping for life, their finances are becoming hopeless their whole country is on the verge of bankruptcy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Now they would get back by the wrong hand what their folly drove away for no cause whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>There can be no doubt that though they have neither the wisdom nor the men to succeed in the vast plan which they are connecting, they will make desperate efforts this winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>If he <hi rend="italics">had</hi> yielded to the outside pressure, he would have been not only a coward, but a traitor; for a General, entrusted with grave responsibilities cannot permit his own superior knowledge and judgment to be overruled by the dogmatism of ignorance and incompetency, without a criminally as great as would be involved in the actual surrender of his army to an enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>But, although there is nothing in this but what may be considered fairly to come within the scope of discussion, since it is perfectly legitimate for a Government to attempt to confront a national emergency, the crisis is, after all, not of such magnitude or uncertainty as to be beyond control or mitigation by ordinary means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>The low price of cotton goods, and the largeness of the stocks held at nearly all the markets of the world, may reconcile us to a pause in the rate of production; and although during this pause the contingency may have to be met of supporting a large unemployed population, the cost in that respect will be in no small degree compensated by the rise in the value of the goods in question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>At the same time, each account we receive from distant parts tends to show how every available bale from countries capable of producing the plant is likely to find its way to us. Moreover, although the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> still assert that they will meet the blockade of the enemy by a self-imposed blockade, and not allow a pound of cotton to leave their territory, it is seen that this declaration does not harmonize with the last news &mdash; that at the taking of the <rs>Hatteras</rs> forts, a vessel fully laden with cotton was found waiting to run out and evade the <rs>Federal</rs> cruisers.
