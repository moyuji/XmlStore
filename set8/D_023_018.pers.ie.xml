<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> The train which left this city yesterday morning for the <rs>West</rs>, over the <orgName n="Central Railroad" type="railroad">Central Railroad</orgName>, was obstructed in its progress by a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> raid on <placeName reg="Beaver Dam Station, Allen, Ohio" key="tgn,2157696">Beaver Dam Station</placeName>, about <placeName><distance reg="27miles">27 miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>On nearing the above station, the train encountered several cross ties and trees which had been carefully laid upon the track, with a view to throw the train off, but which happily failed in the object intended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>This brought the train to a halt, when a citizen of the neighborhood came up and informed the conductor that a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> force had made its appearance at the station, about <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a mile beyond, and were engaged in tearing up the railroad track.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>On the receipt of this intelligence, the train put back with all possible speed, and arrived here about <time value="2pm">2 o'clock P. M.</time> It is also stated that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had fired the depot at <placeName reg="Beaver Dam, Dodge, Wisconsin" key="tgn,2120707">Beaver Dam</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> This is a most daring and independent raid of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and must have been effected by a comparatively small force, as they are not known to be in any considerable numbers in that locality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The impression obtains that the party committing these depredations consisted of cavalry scouts from <placeName key="tgn,1002235" n="1.000 3" reg="caroline, virginia, united states">Caroline</placeName> or <placeName reg="Spotsylvania, Spotsylvania, Virginia" key="tgn,2114316">Spotsylvania</placeName> counties, and that the raid was perpetrated with the hope of cutting off communication with our forces between this city and the <rs>Rapidan</rs>. </p> 
<div4 type="entry" n="1">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> From a gentleman who left <placeName reg="Beaver Dam, Dodge, Wisconsin" key="tgn,2120707">Beaver Dam</placeName> on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time>, we have ascertained some facts which possess interest in connection with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> foray upon the <orgName n="Central Railroad" type="railroad">Central Railroad</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>A young <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> has been for some time permitted to pass between that point and <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, keeping up a traffic in articles which he supposed would be readily purchased by the inhabitants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Only <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> ago, he made his appearance at <placeName reg="Beaver Dam Station, Allen, Ohio" key="tgn,2157696">Beaver Dam Station</placeName>, in company with <num value="2">two</num> ladies from <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, who had received passports from the <rs>Federal</rs> commander at that place, and were on their way to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, to visit some relations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>This <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> also brought with him a sack of salt, and a quantity of lemons, which found ready sale, but he refused to receive Confederate notes in payment &mdash; nothing but gold would satisfy him. This circumstance excited some suspicion, but he was allowed to depart unmolested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>While at <placeName reg="Beaver Dam, Dodge, Wisconsin" key="tgn,2120707">Beaver Dam</placeName> he had ample opportunities to make observations and to acquaint himself thoroughly with the situation of affairs in the vicinity; and very shortly after his return we hear of this <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> raid, which was undertaken with a perfect knowledge that it might be done without any great danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>That the enemy received their information from this <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> pedlar there is little doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Facts like this ought to incite our authorities to increased vigilance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> Besides obstructing the railroad, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> cut the telegraph wire, and we are thus unable to get positive information concerning the state of affairs at <placeName reg="Beaver Dam Station, Allen, Ohio" key="tgn,2157696">Beaver Dam station</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>It is believed, however, that the depot was destroyed by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, who retreated towards that point on the approach of the train, and a dense volume of smoke was soon afterwards seen in the same direction. </p> </div4> </div3>

<head>The lines <rs>East</rs> of the <rs type="place">Blue Ridge</rs> &mdash; affairs in the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> Affairs in the neighborhood of <placeName key="tgn,2111971" n="1.000 34" reg="gordonsville, orange, virginia">Gordonsville</placeName> remain comparatively quiet and at the date of our latest advices the enemy had made no demonstration in force on this side of the <rs>Rapidan</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> last an attack was made by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> cavalry upon a small body of the <orgName type="regiment" key="6VACav">6th Virginia cavalry</orgName>, near <placeName reg="Orange, Virginia" key="tgn,7014299">Orange Court House</placeName>, which was gallantly resisted by our troops, who drove the enemy back killing and wounding several, and taking <measure n="44" type="prisoners">forty-four prisoners</measure>. The pursuit was kept up as far as the south bank of the river, across which the larger portion of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> succeeded in swimming their horses, and made good their escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The prisoners, who were brought to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time> by the <rs>Central</rs> train, belong abjectly to the <orgName type="regiment" key="5NYCav">5th New York cavalry regiment</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>There is no loss reported on the <rs>Confederate</rs> side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Altogether, this was a brilliant little affair. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> Our last accounts from <persName n="Robertson,General,B.,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="default:Robertson,B.,H.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Robertson</surname></persName>'s <orgName n="command">command</orgName>, in the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>, represent that he is conducting the campaign there with skill and success, and at the same time keeping a sharp eye upon the movements of the enemy <rs>East</rs> of the <rs type="place">Blue Ridge</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>A skirmish occurred about a week since between <placeName key="tgn,2112770" n="1.000 38" reg="luray, page, virginia">Luray</placeName> and <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName> <persName n="Ford,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Ford,nomatch:0"><surname>Ford</surname></persName>, <placeName reg="Page, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002178">Page county</placeName>, in which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were completely routed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>It appears that <persName n="Gilmot,Captain,Harry,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="default:Gilmot,Harry,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <foreName>Harry</foreName> <surname>Gilmot</surname></persName>, leading some <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> companies of <orgName n="Confederate Cavalry" type="org">Confederate cavalry</orgName>, charged upon <num value="6">six</num> squadrons of the enemy and drove them through <placeName key="tgn,2112770" n="1.000 38" reg="luray, page, virginia">Luray</placeName>, where the latter received reinforcements, and <rs type="role2">Capt</rs>. G. retired in good order and without loss, to the <rs type="place">Ford</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Here he was reinforced and again started in pursuit of the enemy who fled before him and retreated through <placeName reg="Thornton's Gap">Thornton's Gap</placeName> into <placeName reg="Rappahannock, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002184">Rappahannock county</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>By taking this route the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> doubtless hoped to draw our cavalry on until they reached the main body of their army, but it is presumed that <persName n="Gilmor,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Gilmor,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Gilmor</surname></persName> fully understood the motive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>In this affair the enemy lost several in killed and wounded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> A line of telegraph is in process of construction between <placeName reg="Harrisonburg, Harrisonburg, Virginia" key="tgn,2112170">Harrisonburg</placeName> and <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName>, for military purposes, by means of which the army of the <rs type="place">Valley</rs> will be enabled to communicate directly with the capital. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> By recent arrivals from <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> we are placed in possession of reliable and interesting information of the operations of the <rs>Federal</rs> forces in the <rs type="place">Lower Valley</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The town, up to <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> last, was unoccupied by the enemy, but about <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> Northwest of the place they had strong fortifications erected on what is known as <placeName reg="Shultz's Hill">Shultz's Hill</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>From these fortifications they occasionally saluted the inhabitants with shells, as if to test the accuracy of the range of their guns upon the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>They state that their force on this bill numbers <num value="3000">three thousand</num>, but our informant does not think that they exceed <num value="1500">fifteen hundred</num> or <num value="2000">two thousand</num> at most.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Since their return to <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>, after the retreat of <persName n="Banks,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Banks,nomatch:0"><surname>Banks</surname></persName>, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have been decidedly cautions in all their movements, and manifest the greatest uneasiness in all their actions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>They seem to dread the approach of <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> and his forces, and are at all times prepared to skedaddle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The force now in the vicinity of the town is understood to be a portion of the command of the reckless and unprincipled <persName n="Geary,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Geary,nomatch:0"><surname>Geary</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time> last there was a fight at <placeName reg="Middletown, Frederick, Virginia" key="tgn,7014049">Middletown</placeName>, on the <rs type="place">Valley turnpike</rs>, about <placeName><distance reg="8miles">eight miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName></placeName>, between our cavalry scouts and the pickets of the enemy, in which they sustained a loss of <measure n="8" type="killed and wounded">eight killed and wounded</measure>. The only loss suffered on our side was the wounding of a horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>This little skirmish had greatly excited the fears of the whole Federal camp, and they had withdrawn their pickets from that road entirely.--The gentleman from whom we obtain our information says that he came through from <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> to <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName> in a buggy, without the slightest interruption the entire route. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> Since the re-occupation of the town by the enemy after their expulsion by <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, they have destroyed several buildings by fire, principally warehouses in the neighborhood of the depot, where they previously had stores deposited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/><num value="1">One</num> of these was the large store house of <persName n="Baker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Baker,nomatch:0"><surname>Baker</surname></persName> &#x0026; Bro., which, with all their stock, was consumed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> Desertions among the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were of frequent occurrence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>In <num value="1">one</num> instance a guard of <num value="40">forty</num> left <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> with a lot of Confederate prisoners who had been picked up at various points, and before reaching <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> <num value="30">thirty</num> of the <num value="40">forty</num> deserted, and <num value="40">forty</num> out of the gang of prisoners made their escape. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> When the gentleman from whom we derive our information left the town, the enemy had strong pickets on the <rs>Berryville</rs> and Northwestern routes, as if anticipating a <q>&#x0022;rebel&#x0022;</q> approach on those roads. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The crops in <placeName reg="Frederick, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002161">Frederick</placeName>, <persName n="Clarke,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Clarke,nomatch:0"><surname>Clarke</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>, were unusually good, but owing to the scarcity of labor, only a portion of the wheat harvest would be gathered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Many of the farmers were saving what they could, but others were permitting the wheat to start in the fields, without the entrance of a scythe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> commandant had issued a circular to the farmers to induce them to gather their grain, assuring them the <rs>Government</rs> would purchase it at a price hereafter to be fixed. </p>
