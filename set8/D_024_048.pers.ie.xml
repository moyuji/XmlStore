<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> A <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus case,</hi> involving more questions of general interest than any which has yet been brought before the country, was decided by <persName n="Meredith,Judge,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:Meredith,Henry,Hickman,,:2"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Meredith</surname></persName> yesterday, after elaborate and protracted argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>It involves the right of the <rs>Government</rs> to the military services of a large number of able-bodied residents of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, between the ages of <num value="18">eighteen</num> and <num value="40">forty</num>, who have heretofore been considered as exempt from military duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The facts are briefly as follows: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> <persName><foreName>William</foreName></persName> and <persName n="Harman,,Charles,P.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="default:Harman,Charles,P.,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Harman</surname></persName> at the commencement of the existing war were living in the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName> with their father, who had in the year <dateStruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></dateStruct> removed from <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName> to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, in consequence of having received an appointment of clerk in <num value="1">one</num> of the departments of Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>His sons were born in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and at the commencement of the war <num value="1">one</num> was of age and the other a minor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>In <dateStruct value="-04-"><month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct> or <dateStruct value="1861-05-"><month reg="05">May</month>, <year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, both of them enlisted in a volunteer company, and entered the military service of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>They served for <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> and <measure n="90days" type="date">ninety days</measure>, and then claimed their discharge upon the ground of being <unclear></unclear> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The validity of their claim was conceded by <persName n="Taliaferro,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Taliaferro,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Taliaferro</surname></persName>, the enrolling officer for the <name>Cherlottesville</name> district, and they were furnished with exemption papers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>They were, however, subsequently arrested by order of the <rs>Colonel</rs> of the regiment in which they had served, and held to military service under the conscript act of <date value="1862-04-16">April 16, 1862.</date> </p> </q><bibl n="Judge Meredith"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> The petitioners appealed for and obtained writs of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> for the purpose of ascertaining whether they were liable to military duty as &#x0022;residents&#x0022; of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>In the hearing of the case, before <persName n="Meredith,Judge,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Meredith,Henry,Hickman,,:2"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Meredith</surname></persName>, <persName n="Leake,the Honorable,Shelton,F.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="default:Leake,Shelton,F.,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">Hon.</roleName> <foreName>Shelton</foreName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <surname>Leake</surname></persName> appeared for the petitioners, and made use of the various points bearing upon the case, to procure their discharge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/><persName n="Aylett,,P.,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="default:Aylett,P.,H.,,"><foreName>P.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Aylett</surname></persName>, Erq., <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> <rs type="role" reg="District Attorney">District Attorney</rs>, appeared for the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, and resisted the application for the discharge of the petitioners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The argument on both sides was able and elaborate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> <persName n="Moredith,Judge,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Moredith,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Moredith</surname></persName> delivered a long and able opinion, in which he sustained with much force and learning the points made by the counsel for the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>He decided that the removal of the petitioners' father to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> to accept a clerkship in the <orgName n="Post Office Department" type="department">Post-Office Department</orgName> had not changed the domicil either of the father or of his family, as the office was <num value="1">one</num> revocable at the will of the appointing power, and that the residence of the petitioners there was from &#x0022;necessity,&#x0022; arising from the authority of the father.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>He also decided that, admitting the father of the petitioners to have acquired a domicil in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, the petitioners, as native-born <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginians</rs>, had, at the commencement of the war, an undoubted right to resume their native citizenship, and that by returning to the domicil of their origin, and by taking up arms to fight our battles, they had furnished the highest and most conclusive evidence of their voluntary resumption of their rights as citizens of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> &mdash; Against such acts as these the <rs>Judge</rs> said that more declarations of the <hi rend="italics">animus</hi> of the petitioners should not be permitted to weigh. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> <persName n="Mergdith,Judge,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Mergdith,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Mergdith</surname></persName> commented on and sustained the point (made by <persName n="Aylett,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="nearbymention:Aylett,P.,H.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Aylett</surname></persName>) that the domicil of the soldier was that of the country in whose service he was enlisted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Nothing, he said, could be clearer than that by entering the military service you acquire a domicil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>He cited and commented upon a large number of interesting decisions in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, <placeName reg="Germany" key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, and <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, to show that no principle of law was more clearly established than the <num value="1">one</num> contended for by the counsel for the <rs>Government</rs>, and expressed the opinion that every citizen of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and every foreigner who had once enlisted in our armies, it mattered not for how brief a period, was a fit subject for conscription, if between the ages of <num value="18">eighteen</num> and <num value="40">forty</num>, and he expressed the hope that the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> would at once <unclear></unclear> all persons thus liable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> The language of this Conscript act, the learned <rs>Judge</rs> said, was exceedingly broad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>It evidently contemplated the conscription of all &#x0022;residents&#x0022; in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> between the specified years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Whether they were residents in pursuit of pleasure, money, or what not, they were clearly liable, under the broad language of the act, and should be conscribed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The <rs>Judge</rs> also decided that the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> could disregard all exemptions which had been given by enrolling officers where they had been improperly given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The petitioners, he decided, were not held at this time in custody of the proper official, and were therefore entitled to their discharge; but it was strictly legitimate and proper for the proper enrolling officer for the <name>Albmarie</name> district to enroll them as conscripts, and make the proper disposal of them under the provisions of the <name>Conscript</name> act of <date value="1862-04-16">16th April, 1862.</date> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> It is understood that no appeal will be taken from this important decision, and the action of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> and of the numerous enrolling officers will doubtless conform to it. </p> </div3> </div2>

<head>Government credit.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/> The best and only permanent means of maintaining the credit of a Government is taxation. --The expedients of our own Government &mdash; such as printing on the face of the paper issues that they were &#x0022;findable in <num value="0.08">eight per cent.</num> bonds of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>&#x0022;--have been unavailing in the face of the continued emission of that paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>To the great body of the people the promise of <num value="0.08">eight per cent.</num> added not a title of value to the note for this <num value="0.08">eight per cent</num>, could only date from the time the note on whose face it is pledged is converted into the bond, and the marses will be unable to hold the bonds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>They will fall into the hands of speculators, extortioners, corrupt quartermasters, etc. But we can produce high authority to show that this <num value="0.08">eight per cent.</num> pledge, made to keep up the credit of the note on which it is printed, is not considered binding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>Prominent statesmen have seriously proposed that all of those notes not offered for conversion by a certain day shall be denied the right of conversion into <num value="0.08">eight per cent.</num> bonds, and another proposition goes so far as to say that all not brought in by a certain day for exchange for bonds shall cease to be currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/><num value="1">One</num> proposition is to repudiate the <rs>Government</rs>'s pledge as to interest; the other is, we suppose, to repudiate the issues of the <rs>Government</rs> in all transactions with the <rs>Government</rs> &mdash; i. e., they will not be received in payment to the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>It is hardly possible that there can be any purpose to repudiate them altogether; but the effect upon the credit of the notes so put under she ban must be seriously injurious to the holders. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/> So that the promise of interest, like other expedients, cannot keep up the credit of a piece of paper which is itself but a promise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>The true basis of credit is a wise system of finance based on solid revenues, including a liberal tax paid by a people able and willing to pay it. We have no idea that our Government designs repudiating anything &mdash; not even interest that in promised on its notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>But its only resort, sooner or later, to raise the means to pay its debts is <hi rend="italics">taxation</hi> The sooner it shows its determination to employ this only reliable agent the better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>Congress may beat the bush and waste time diseassing futile schemes for &#x0022;retiring&#x0022; the currency, but until it goes boldly to work on a tax bill and passes it, there will be really nothing done to elevate the credit of the <rs>Government</rs>'s paper &mdash; nay, nor anything whatever added to the means for the prosecution of the great undertakings now forced upon its shoulders. </p> </div3>

<head>Boasted Northern superiority.</head>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/> The arrogant assumption by the <rs>North</rs> of intellectual and military superiority to the <rs>South</rs> has been completely exploded in the judgment of all mankind by the present war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>The liberties of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> were established by the greatness and valor of a Southern military leader, and its Constitution was the product of Southern wisdom and patriotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>The very fact complained of by jealous Northern sectionalists, that the <rs>Federal Government</rs> was, for the greater part of its history, administered by Southern <rs type="role2">Presidents</rs> is of itself an answer to the ridiculous assumption of Northern intellectual superiority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>If the theory be true that the people are capable of selecting the wisest men of the nation as their rulers, how came they so uniformly to select them from the <rs>South</rs>, unless Southern statement possessed superior qualifications for Government!. And if success be the test of ability, what better proof can be required of the competency of the long line of Southern statement who held the helm of the ship of State, than the gigantic progress of the <rs>U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>It was not till Northern demagogues obtained power that the fortunes of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> began to wane.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>Superiority in numbers and in wealth, the product of partial legislation, was the only superiority that the <rs>North</rs> could justly claim over the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>The Father of his Country was a Southerner, its greatest jurist a Southerner, its greatest orator a Southerner, its most illustrious military leaders Southern.
