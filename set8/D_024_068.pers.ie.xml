<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/> Of course it is a Massachusetts war; it is so in its it aspirations, in the mode of conducting it, and the objects at which it aims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>Any other State than <placeName key="tgn,7007517" n="1.000 5" reg="massachusetts">Massachusetts</placeName>, which brought nothing to the common stock, and subsisted only by the patronage of the <rs>General Government</rs>, would have blushed to inaugurate an aggressive war against those members of the firm which had brought to the co-partnership all the capital it possessed, and, by legislative protection of the interests of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, had made her a great manufacturing and commercial State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>But humility and gratitude were never among the virtues of the <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> bread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>The very fact that all her greatness was derived from the <rs>Union</rs> was enough to make her envious and implacable towards those by whom it had been conferred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>The truths that she had been the most malcontent of all the <rs>State</rs>; that the had deliberately nullified the fugitive slave law, and upon the annexation of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> proclaimed the <rs>Union</rs> dissolved, were additional incentives to take the lead in persecuting any discontented State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>There are same nations whom the conferring of favors converts into enemies; who cannot rest under a sense of obligation, and are never satisfied till they have stung the bosom that warmed them to life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>Such is <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>; a State which, but for the hot-house legislation of the <rs>General Government</rs>, for tariffs, passing privileges, and fishing bounties, would now be the most barren rock on the <rs type="place">Atlantic coast</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/> The prominent part taken by <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> in this war is not surprising to any <num value="1">one</num> acquainted with her antecedents and character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>We trust that her share may not be less prominent in its calamitous results; we trust that <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, which claims the distinction of drawing the sword in this war, will yet perish by the sword, physically, financially, and industrially. </p> </div3>
