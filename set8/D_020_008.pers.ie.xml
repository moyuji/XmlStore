<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/> I was quickly called to attend Saltion in a seve, attack of defirium tremens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>There lay the strong man, raying of devils and sunkes, as he expressed it, creeping things innumerable, both small and great; his face flailed, his eyes bloodshot and glistening, his tongue bitten through, and his black lips streaked with foam.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>He was struggling with imaginary demons, and shouting at the top of his voice that he was devil possessed, and that his time has come to go to litter darkness--<q>&#x0022;On devils of the air, how they glare on me!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>Messengers of Satan seat to buffet me, I'll have it out yet I Off, off I say!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>Crawl, crawl, creep!&#x0022;</q> Then would ensue a fearful paroxysm, and he would make attaches at the bed clothes, or cower beneath them, or peep over the edge of the bed, with an expression of horror and fright difficult to forget &mdash; murderous in its terror It required the utmost effort of <num value="4">four</num> able men to keep him down in bed. Now, unless physical force be applied so as not only to be perfectly adequate, but also to appear overwhelming, I have always found it productive of more harm than good; so, after repeated trials.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/>I adopted the plan of keeping him in a recumbent position by means of a strong webbing across his chest, which was fastened down to the sines of the bed He made several attempts, when he broke loose by accident, to throw himself out of the window. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/> He told me afterward that he perfectly remembered this, and that he did it, not for the desire of enicide, which be after ward experienced, but that he felt the conviction of being able to float painlessly on the air His screams and yells were awful, and when they ceased he gabbled faces <unclear></unclear>; it seemed a veritable diarct &#x0152; of words, sometimes in senseless soliloquy, sometimes in ejaculations addressed to the imaginary beings who crowded his chamber; unpining their pity of depreciating their in cults.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>Through out consciousness was, as it were, broken no into fragments, exhibiting an litter absence of that alternate conditenity which I have had occasion to remark as present in genuine insanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>In brain fever the same moohereney is generally noticeable &mdash; When he became a little more quict, he was the prey of universal dread, in which every form, every sound, all the relations of existence, seemed to inspire him with a nameless fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>Far this he did not attempt to assign any reasonable cause; and it was pitiable to see how he would start and tremble even at the abutting of a door or the entrance of his servant into the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>The delirium run its course, leaving him in a state of settled dejection; for days he would, if allowed, sit dumb and motionless, apparently without desire of will; his arms folded, his head sunk on his chest, and his eyes fixed on the ground with an expression of the deepest gloom; the utmost that could be extracted from him in reply to any question, was <q>&#x0022;yes&#x0022;</q> or <q>&#x0022;no.&#x0022;</q>--<hi rend="italics">Cernhill Magazine.</hi> </p> </div3>
