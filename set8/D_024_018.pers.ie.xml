<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/> It is evidently inspired by a conscious security which has never hitherto characterized any manifesto which emanated from the rebel Executive and it breathes and air of determination and defiance which is not justified by what meets the public eye. It is true that the <rs>Confederate President</rs> is aware of the divisions and disgust at the <rs>North</rs>, produced by the <name>Abolition</name> policy, and particularly the emancipation edict extorted from <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00086" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abe,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, which is worth <num value="200000">two hundred thousand</num> men to the cause of the rebellion, for it enables the rebel Government to prove that their anticipations of the designs of the radical party are fully realized and to make out a plausible case of justification before the people for the rebellion of the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/> The rebel <rs>President</rs> gives extracts from <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00087" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abe,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s inaugural address, and quotes the resolution of Congress defining the war to he a war for the vindication of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the maintenance of the <rs>Union</rs>, and not a war of subjugation, or for the purpose of interfering in any way with the domestic institutions of the <rs>Southern States</rs>; and he then cites the subsequent acts of Congress, and the policy of the <name>Administration</name> as totally opposite to the pledges under which the war was inaugurated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>In relation to the proclamation he <unclear></unclear> appeals to the sentiment of the civilized world. &#x0022;to the instincts of that common humanely which a beneficent Creator has implanted in the breasts of our fellow men of all countries, to past judgement on a measure of which several <num value="1000000">millions</num> of human beings of an inferior race &mdash; peaceful and contented laborers in their sphere &mdash; are doomed to extermination, while, at the same time, they are encouraged to a general assassination of their masters by the <unclear></unclear> odious recommendation to abstain from violence, unless in necessary self defence.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/> The Administration and the radicals seem to have given him a chance to the sympathies of the whose man of the <rs>North</rs> and the <name>Cassiani</name> race throughout the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>They have enabled him to consolidate the military strength of the <rs>South</rs> by a conscript law, to control its financial resources, and unite the people, morally and politically, as <num value="1">one</num> man, while their programme has had a most disastrous effect at the <rs>North</rs> in dividing and distracting the popular sentiment, and, according to the abolition press, it has utterly demoralized and destroyed the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>, on which the success of the <rs>Union</rs> cause so greatly depended.--Hence the <rs>President</rs> of the rebellious States it confident in his expectations and rampant in his threats of retaliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>He says he has directed the execution of <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00088" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName> and &#x0022;<num value="1">one</num> <persName n="McNeil,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00089" reg="mostcommon:McNeil,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McNeil</surname></persName>, who murdered <measure n="7" type="prisoners">seven prisoners</measure> of war in cold blood,&#x0022; if they should fall into the hands of any of the <orgName n="Confederate Forces" type="org">Confederate forces</orgName>; and he has also masked out for vengeance &#x0022;another General by the name of <persName n="Milroy,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00090" reg="nearbymention:Milroy,R.,B.,,"><surname>Milroy</surname></persName>,&#x0022; charged with hideous atrocities in <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/> There may be little in these threats, as the intended victims are not yet in his power, and are not likely soon to be. But there may be something in these menaces after all &mdash; something more than the mere military, political, and financial situation would warrant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>It is more than possible, notwithstanding the general terms in which <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00091" reg="mostcommon:Davis,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> complains of the <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> powers for not recognizing the independence of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, and for shutting out from their ports privateers and their prizes, he has some understanding with the <rs>Emperor</rs> of the <rs>French</rs> which will be brought to light in <unclear></unclear> time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>In confirmation of this view, it is worthy of remark that in the rebel Congress, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>, a resolution was introduced eulogizing <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> &#x0022;for her endeavors to induce <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> intervention.&#x0022;--And when we cast a glance at the other side of the <rs>Atlantic</rs>, we find that the relations of <persName n="Slidell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00092" reg="mostcommon:Slidell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Slidell</surname></persName> with <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00093" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> and his ministers are far more cordial than is consistent with strict neutrality, much less with the warm professions of friendship for the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> which he has constantly made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>The greeting of the <rs>Emperor</rs> to <persName n="Dayton,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00094" reg="mostcommon:Dayton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Dayton</surname></persName> on <dateStruct value="-01-01"><occasion>New Year's day</occasion></dateStruct> was, to say the least, decidedly cold, if it was not a place of bitter Irony, under the circumstances. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>The earnest determination of the <rs>South</rs> must be met by a corresponding determination on his part, and on the part of the people of the loyal States; otherwise the <rs>Union</rs> is irretrievably lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>The same unity of purpose and of action must be developed at the <rs>North</rs> as at the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>The rebels are terribly in earnest, while everything that transpires at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> shows that the <name>Administration</name> are &#x0022;like <persName n="Nero,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00096" reg="mostcommon:Nero,nomatch:0"><surname>Nero</surname></persName> finding while Some was burning.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/> There is but <num value="1">one</num> path of safety for the <rs>President</rs>, and that is to remove from his Cabinet the radicals, fanatics, and imbeciles who have brought our national affairs to a crisis so full of perill, and to put in their placemen of well known capacity and of conservative principles, who hold the salvation of the <rs>Union</rs> paramount to all theories about negro equality, <hi rend="italics">and who will advise <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00097" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abe,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> to with draw his proclamation,</hi> and return to the <rs>Constitution</rs> in all things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/> If the subjugation of those States depended upon battles fought on paper, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> would certainly subjugate them in a very short time.--Their battles on the field are almost always disastrous to themselves, on paper, they are only so many triumphs, each for the time unparallel, and each rising in dignity and importance above the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>But the other day we beat them badly in the field at <placeName key="tgn,7014175" n="1.000 17" reg="murfreesborough, rutherford, tennessee">Murfreesborough</placeName> and <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>They have made themselves amends, after their fashion, by a great victory at <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName> Post. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/> With regard to the details of this exploit, as published by as yesterday from the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName>, we must say that we are utterly incredulous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/><placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName> Post is an old <name>French</name> settlement in <placeName reg="Arkansas, Arkansas, United States" key="tgn,2000105">Arkansas county</placeName>, on the <placeName key="tgn,7019842" n="1.000 46" reg="arkansas river, united states, north and central america">Arkansas river</placeName>, about <measure n="100miles" type="distance">one hundred miles</measure> above the mouth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>It was a post during the existence of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and was held by a small force, never more, we believe than <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> companies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>There were no fortifications there, and, as far as we can learn from the most diligent inquiry at the proper source, no considerable body of troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>At the utmost it is not believed that there were more than <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="500">five hundred</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>Yet the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> paper victory calls for <measure n="7000" type="prisoners">7,000 prisoners</measure>, <measure n="550" type="killed and wounded">550 killed and wounded</measure>, and <num value="9">nine</num> cannon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>If we placed credit in this alleged victory, we should be at a loss to know from whence so many men came, how they got to <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName> Post, who commanded them, and what could have induced them to surrender without inflicting a loss of more than <num value="100">one hundred</num> men upon the enemy.--The whole story is incredible, and we predict that it will turn out to be a fabrication, based upon the surprise and capture of an old dilapidated fort, and a few companies left there to guard the public <unclear></unclear> We can never be induced to believe that <num value="7600">7,600</num> Confederate soldiers could have surrendered, after a resistance so feeble as that implied in the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> accounts, without making some effort to escape, either by abandoning the post before it was invested, or cutting their way out after it war. A few days, however, possibly a few hours, will bring us reports from our own officers in that quarter. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/> Thad, <persName n="Stevens,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00185" reg="nearbymention:Stevens,Thad,,,"><surname>Stevens</surname></persName> is determined not to let the contrabands eat the bread of idleness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>As <num value="300000">300,000</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> troops go out of service in <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, he proposes to supply half the deficiency by darkles.--These latter, therefore, are likely to have a lively time of it in future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>They though, no doubt, when they left their masters and went off with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, that they would spend the rest of their lives in idleness, which state is the genuine <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African's</rs> ideal of Heaven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>They are likely to find themselves mistaken in their calculations, as wiser men have been before them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> do not know what to do with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>By carrying them North they displace while labor in a country where it is either work or starve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>The huge number that have already gone there has been the cause of serious riots on more than <num value="1">one</num> occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>The still greater number expected may breed intestine war. It is absolutely necessary to do something with them, and Thad thinks he has found out what that something should be. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/> Poor cuff is placed in a most awkward predicament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>There has been nothing like it since the days of the trial of witches by the ordeal of water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>If the person accused swam she was a witch, and was burnt for skill in aquatics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>If she sank she was no witch, and was only drowned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>So cuff must enlist or be shot by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>If he enlist, he is to expect no quarter from his former masters, for most assuredly none will be given.--He will have already forfeited his life by bearing arms against the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>If taken, he will be hanged; if not taken, he stands a pretty good chance of being shot; if he escape, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> will bring him back again, and keep on trying him until they get him finished at last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>Here is a very bright prospect for poor cuff, and it cannot fall to make him more in love than ever with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/> The introduction of this proposition by <persName n="Stevens,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00186" reg="nearbymention:Stevens,Thad,,,"><surname>Stevens</surname></persName> indicates an assurance on his part, and doubtless on that of his party also, that the gap to be made by the withdrawal of so many men in <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> cannot easily be filled up. As citizens the negro will improve <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> society very greatly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>They are better bred and more honest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>But they are not exactly the material for soldiers, and as the making of them soldiers is not what they bargained for when they ran off and left their masters, they will not be apt to take to it with a very good will, especially when they know that they are not to expect quarter if taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> must have become tired, indeed, of the war when it is found necessary to fill up their ranks by such substitutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>The circumstance is full of encouragement to us, and ought, by all means, to stimulate our authorities in pushing the conscription.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>Let us have a full army in the spring, and we will put an end to this last <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> levy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>They will never be able to raise another.
