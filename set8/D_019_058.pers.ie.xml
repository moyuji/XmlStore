<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> the undersigned begs leave to assign his reasons for his dissent from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> partial report of the <rs>Committee</rs> on Federal Relations, and presents the following as a substitute for the plan of measures recommended thereby to be adopted by the <rs>Convention</rs>: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> this Convention, called by the people of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, to deliberate upon the present exigencies of their Federal Relations, and upon the redress of their wrongs and grievances in the <rs>Confederacy</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, deems it necessary and proper, with a view to preserve peace, to defend the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>, and to restore and perpetuate the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName> of all the <name>States</name>, on a basis of just and equal rights, to declare: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> that for a long series of years the property of the citizens of the slaveholding States, and particularly that of her own citizens, has been assailed and endangered; that the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> has been broken; that the rights and comities of States, and their equality in the <rs>Union</rs>, have been denied to the people of the slaveholding States; that the <rs>Federal</rs> laws have been nullified in respect to the protection of their property in slaves; that the separate and independent right of self-government by the border slaveholding States has been seriously impaired, and, in part, practically annulled; that their domestic tranquility and social safety have been endangered and ruthlessly disturbed by actual invasion; that associated and systematic efforts have been constantly and persistently made to enforce upon their people rules of conscience and of morals by a power without their borders, to control the family Governments of their homes and their Relations as masters to their domestic slaves; that their character as a people has been maligned and misrepresented to the world, in order to bring an influence to bear upon their rights and Relations and their wills, rendering them odious, and no lest offensive and injurious to their sense of self-respect, and to their interests, than the force of arms; that the sanctity of the <rs>Federal Judiciary</rs> has been threatened and set at naught, in order to destroy the only peaceful guard and guarantee of their rights of property and Federal equality; and that a sectional hate which engendered these evils is continually magnifying them by every form and effort of incendiarism, until they are no longer desirable; until the people actuated by it have obtained the reigns of Federal authority and control in all the departments of Government; and until several of the severeignties, parties to the <rs>Federal</rs> compact, have been compelled to resume the powers granted by them under the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>, and to form a separate and independent Confederacy, thereby dissolving the <orgName n="United States Union" type="union">Union of the United States of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName></orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> these wrongs have been perpetrated in part by the <rs>Federal Government</rs> either by acts of omission or commission, <unclear>in</unclear> paid by the non-slaveholding States, and in part by their people, unrestrained by laws, such as confederates are bound to enact in respect to the rights and safety of each other. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> and the secession, consequent upon these wrongs, is now met by every indication of an intention and an attempt to course the submission of seceding States, by the authorities of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, who are but the mere agents of the sovereign parties to the <rs>Federal</rs> compact, without even an appeal to them for the sanction of any ultimate resort to force. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/> thus, under the pretext of enforcing laws of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, the jurisdiction of which is now denied and abjured by the seceding States, the nation is imminently threatened by an unnatural and unnecessary civil war &mdash; equally unnecessary, whether the <rs>Union</rs> is to be finally dissolved or restored. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> these indications are made but too plainly manifest by the failure of the <name>Conference</name>, inaugurated by the <name>Legislature</name> of this Commonwealth herself, to agree on any terms of adjustment; by the disclaimer of all power on the part of the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities to negotiate for peace with the <rs>Commissioners</rs> of the seceded States; by the <rs>Inaugural Address</rs> of the incumbent <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, declaring the policy, powers and purposes of his administration of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, and supposed to represent the sentiments of large majorities of the <name>States</name> constituting the major section of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; by his failure to suggest any mode, whilst disclaiming all powers of adjustment; by the failure of Congress to recognize the results of the <orgName n="Peace Conference" type="conference">peace Conference</orgName>, or to recommend any other plan of peace; and by the concentration of Federal troops at various points, and the reinforcing and holding of certian forts and arsenals, with the obvious intent and purpose of overcoming any resistance to the execution of Federal laws by the seceded States, and to overawe the further secession and free action of the slaveholding States. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> under these circumstances of peril to everything precious to a State, this Commonwealth feels compelled to appeal to her confederates still remaining in the <rs>Union</rs>, and to ask for their determinate conclusions on the following points of difference and dissension, as to which she is bound to demand, and seeks to obtain satisfactory guarantees and assurances for the future: </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/> upon these points, and any others which may arise requiring them, this Commonwealth needs, and ought to demand, additional assurances and guarantees to those now existing; and those assurances and guarantees can, on the main points of dissension and severance, only be made sure by obtaining, not merely constitutional amendments, or the pledges of States by resolves or otherwise, but by grants of power to check abuses or wrongs by a majority of the <name>States</name>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1495"/>To show that they were legal, he adduces precedents of former <rs type="role2">Secretaries</rs> in various departments of the <rs>Government</rs>, and shows that during the war with <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> they were issued to the amount of <measure n="20000000dollars" type="currency">$20,000,000</measure>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1496"/> It was plain that they could obtain credit only <hi rend="italics">upon their contract;</hi> and the acceptances I gave seemed the only mode available of providing them with the means necessary for their operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1498"/>This firm had, by its promptness, efficiency and fairdealing, won the confidence of the <rs>Government</rs>, in whose service it had been since <dateStruct value="1843--"><year reg="1843">1843</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1499"/>It was, therefore, under the cireumstances, no imprudence even to confide to them the important trust of taking care of their own credit. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1500"/> At the time the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of the acceptances were given, there was a deficiency of funds to pay for the operations of the <orgName n="Quartermaster Department" type="department">Quartermaster's Department</orgName>, for the fiscal year preceding that of my coming into office; besides which fact, an extraordinary outlay, in advance of appropriations, was necessary for the expedition to <placeName reg="Utah, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007827">Utah</placeName>; and these <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> acceptances were given to meet the emergency thus preseuted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1501"/>Moreover, trains of these contractors, laden with army supplies, had about that time been destroyed by the <rs n="Mormon" type="religion">Mormons</rs>, in respect to which catastrophe the accounting officers of the <rs>Government</rs> were bound, of course, not only to refuse payment of the transportation money earned, but to withhold also the value of the supplies on hand out of other dues of the contractors, who thus lost not only their earnings, but the value of the goods for which they had receipted, as well as their teams and stock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1502"/>This loss, resulting from the act of the public enemy, and justly chargeable upon the <rs>Government</rs>, could only be made good by Congress. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1505"/>And I assert, without contradiction, that such regu larity and certainly, in furnishing supplies of every sort to large forces so remotely posted, at rates so economical and under difficulties so imposing, were never witnessed before in the history of any military movement on the globe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1509"/>On the other hand, the acceptances which I gave to anticipate these earnings, excluding those which were returned to the <name>Department</name> unused and cancelled, was <measure n="5339395dollars" type="currency">$5,339,395</measure>; or <measure n="300000dollars" type="currency">$300,000</measure> less than the earnings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1510"/>Thus the amount of the acceptances that were given during the <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> is due solely to the unprecedented magnitude of the service performed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1511"/>The committee, for sensation purposes, endeavor to produce the impression that these acceptances were all outstanding atone time, and are still outstanding, liable to come against the <rs>Government</rs> for payment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1512"/>As well might they have collected up all the bonds which the <rs>Government</rs> had issued from its beginning, including all that had been paid and cancelled, and declared the grand total to be the debt of the nation.-- They had abundant proof before them that these acceptances, for which the <rs>Government</rs> had at all times security in the amounts accruing to the contractors, were all paid by them as they matured until <dateStruct value="-09-"><month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct> last; and they confess, in another part of their report that, deducting those which were put into the hands of Balley by <persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00945" reg="mostcommon:Russell,nomatch:0"><surname>Russell</surname></persName>, and which I immediately cancelled on discovering the perversion, there were but <measure n="575000dollars" type="currency">$575,000</measure> of them outstanding known to the department; which would of course receive notice of them all.-- (Deducting <measure n="870000dollars" type="currency">$870,000</measure> from <measure n="1445000dollars" type="currency">$1,445,000</measure>, leaves <measure n="575000dollars" type="currency">$575,000</measure>.) The committee were bound to admit this fact; but they cover up the admission in disingenuous verbiage which conceals it from the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1513"/>The committee could also have learned, if they had pursued their inquiries far enough to embrace the whole truth, that the outstanding acceptances had been provided by the contractors in an assignment of property believed to be ample for their protection, and that no ultimate loss to the <rs>Government</rs> is likely to ensue on account of them-- Indeed, that a large portion of them had been secured by double assignments.
