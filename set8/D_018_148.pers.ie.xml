<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> Expedients without number, it is true, have been proposed for the preservation of this Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>I shall call your attention to a few, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to that by Congressional action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The <rs type="place">House</rs> has appointed a Committee of <num value="33">Thirty-three</num>, who are extremely busy &mdash; doing nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>[Laughter] This committee of <num value="1">one</num> from each State--<placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> is represented on it. [The speaker's voice was drowned in a storm of hisses and groans, mingled with exclamations of &#x0022;Black Republican&#x0022;--&#x0022;Traitor.&#x0022;] I assure you I referred to the representative of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> with no intention of disrespect, for I do not know him. [Voices--&#x0022;We do.&#x0022; &#x0022;We know him very badly.&#x0022; An opposing element of the meeting here found expression, and cheers were proposed for <persName n="Bell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Bell,nomatch:0"><surname>Bell</surname></persName> and <persName n="Everett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Everett,nomatch:0"><surname>Everett</surname></persName>, and given with a will, provoking a call for cheers for <persName n="Breckinridge,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Breckinridge,nomatch:0"><surname>Breckinridge</surname></persName>, which was cordially responded &#x0026;c.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> Fellow-citizens, the speaker continued, this movement has passed beyond <persName n="Bell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Bell,nomatch:0"><surname>Bell</surname></persName> and <persName n="Everett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Everett,nomatch:0"><surname>Everett</surname></persName> [Great cheering.] Individuals are now lost sight of, and we stand united upon principle &mdash; at least in <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> we do &mdash; shoulder to shoulder for many of the most earnest advocates of this movement there were ardent supporters of <persName n="Bell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Bell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bell</surname></persName> and <persName n="Everett,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Everett,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Everett</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Let there is no divisions, I exhort you; this is not the time for the manifestation of personal preferences. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> To return to this <orgName n="Congressional committee" type="committee">Congressional Committee</orgName>, it is all trickery and subterfuge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>They don't mean to do anything, and, they can't do anything &mdash; for they haven't started right; they haven't begun at the beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>They are perfecting points of detail, when the vital principle of concession has not been touched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>I was in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> a few days, and spoke with gentlemen on that Committee, to whom I took the liberty of suggesting a resolution similar to that since proposed by <persName n="Crawford,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Crawford,William,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Crawford</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, recognizing the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> as it is recognized in the <rs>Constitution</rs> and in the decisions of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Well, let them attempt to press that resolution, and that moment the <rs>Committee</rs> will explode.--The men from the <rs>North</rs> will never cede that right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>They'll try to delay action till <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct> or <dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct>, but they will never yield the right of slavery, which they deny upon their consciences, and which we, on our consciences, <unclear></unclear>--a right which we will never agree to surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Never. [Applause] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> But suppose they should patch up a compromise, what will it be worth?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Haven't compromises been made before, and violated with impunity?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Hasn't the <name>Constitutional</name> right to recover slaves been trampled under foot?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Hasn't the <rs>Congressional Fugitive Slave</rs> law been trampled under foot?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Hasn't the decision of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> been trampled under foot?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>And all of these having been done time and again by a dozen States, what need of going further?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>If they won't believe <persName n="Moses,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Moses,nomatch:0"><surname>Moses</surname></persName> and the <name>Prophets</name>, neither will they believe <num value="1">one</num> though risen from the dead. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> Another remedy suggested is revolution &mdash; but revolution <hi rend="italics">within</hi> the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>That idea is beyond human comprehension, I think, and no need not be now discussed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> Calling a Convention of the <rs>Slave States</rs> is the popular remedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>[Applause.] But even if feasible as a remedy, such a Convention would be in direct violation of the spirit and of the letter of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and we in <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> oppose it on that account, and because it is not adequate for good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Such a Convention could not assemble before the <date value="03-04">4th of March.</date> The Legislatures of the several States would <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> have to be convened, then separate State Conventions called, and finally the <orgName n="General Convention" type="misc">general Convention</orgName> would have to assemble and &mdash; debate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>But even if the <rs>Convention</rs> could be got together before the <date value="03- 04">4th of March,</date> the probability is that <num value="2">two</num> States at least--<placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>--could not from peculiar circumstances, be represented in it. But the plan is an impracticable <num value="1">one</num>--the <rs>Convention</rs> could only meet with a purpose of preparing for disunion; called with any other purpose it would be futile, and a disunion Convention, <unclear></unclear> need not say, is in violation of the spirit of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The States have no right to go out together &mdash; no <num value="1">one</num> asserts any such right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Each State must go out by herself and in the exercise of her separate State sovereignty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> The only available remedy for our oppression which the <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">State of Mississippi</placeName> can suggest, is that each State shall secede from the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> [A stormy scene followed the last remark of the speaker, a violent storm of hisses being met by a counter-blast of cheers, though the former largely predominated, and was pertinaciously continued after the applause had subsided into an occasional individual shout.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>After a calm of a few seconds the tempest of hisses and applause was resumed with renewed force, parties on the floor of the hall endeavoring to make up in the energy of their demonstrations &mdash; waving of hats and stamping of feet &mdash; for the deficiency in their vocal rivalry of the hisses from the galleries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The excitement bid fair to culminate in a row, and the parties were mounting the seats for the purpose of witnessing that expected result, when a cry of &#x0022;Turn out that &mdash; Black Republican&#x0022; concentrated the attention of the meeting upon an individual near the centre of the hall, who was vigorously hustled out and quiet was again restored, when <num value="3">three</num> cheers were called for &#x0022;<placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.&#x0022; They were given with a will; cheers for <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> were also given, and a call for &#x0022;<num value="3">three</num> cheers for <persName n="Hicks,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Hicks,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Hicks</surname></persName>&#x0022; was responded to with a mingled chorus of cheers, hisses and groans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Cheers for the &#x0022;<placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>&#x0022; were also given.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>[Vociferous cheering] I am here to speak words of truth, and reason soberly and respectfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>If they prove unpleasant, reject them; but I ask to be heard with respect and consideration, and not to be put off with the clamor of prejudice and preconceived opinions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> has her rights under the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and if violated, as they have been, she conceives it to be not only her right, but her duty to resume her sovereign powers and to withdraw from this Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Is there any man here who will hiss that? [&#x0022;No!&#x0022; &#x0022;No!&#x0022;] Our fathers fought not to attain this Union, but for the achievement of the independence of each State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>That achieved, each State became an independent sovereignty, nor was that sovereignty resigned by the <rs>Union</rs> into which they subsequently entered. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> It is objected, too, that the right of secession is nowhere mentioned in the <rs>Constitution</rs>; but neither is the right to elect your Governor, or to convene your Legislature, mentioned there; yet, who will dare question your right to do either?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>No, but the <rs>Constitution</rs> declares that all powers not expressly, or by necessary implication, conferred upon the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, shall be reserved to the several States, and who can point me to the clause in the <rs>Constitution</rs> in which the <name>States</name> have yielded up their separate sovereignty, or the right to vindicate themselves when the compact which binds them to each other shall have been violated? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> We do not propose to go out for the purpose of breaking up this government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>On the contrary, we go to preserve in their purity the institutions which our fathers gave us. We want no new Constitution, no new laws, nor new <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> decisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>We will take with us all that we now have, and say to the aggressive States of the <rs>North</rs>, when you can learn to respect this sacred instrument, and will mark your sincerity by conceding us new and sufficient guarantees, we will gladly renew our fraternal relations with you &mdash; deny us that right, and we will form a <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> and endeavor to maintain our rights independently of you. </p> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> The feelings which now divide the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> into antagonists far more bitter than those of diverse languages and races, are themselves facts which cannot be reasoned away, and they have an irresistible bearing on the practice of slavery &mdash; they must tend to tighten the grasp of the slave-owner on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, and, on the other, to provoke the fanaticism and the ingenuity of the abolitionist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>The Southern States see in this election a pledge of further and still more unscrupulous efforts for the rescue and emancipation of the negro. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/> The very language of the <rs>Southern States</rs> breathes personal apprehension and defiance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>It is vain to dispute the danger, but at least it may be met with reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>As the <rs>Southern States</rs> certainly would not mend matters by a separation, and as the <sic>Nrothern</sic> States can do nothing, and have done nothing, to mitigate the evils for which they profess so much abhorrence, all that can be done is to take a moderate and rational view of the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>To both the <rs>Northern</rs> and Southern States we beg to suggest what has happened in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>A few years ago all <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> went crying mad over a story which certainly was a master piece of writing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> impression was that which the writer intended &mdash; an unbounded horror of slavery and indignation against the slave master. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/> Never was eloquence better listened to; never had an argument fairer play, for at least <num value="1000000">1,000,000</num> <name>British</name> men and women read or listened to the book in the silence of their homes, and the fair advocate carried the sympathies spell bound to the last line of the last page.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>What is now the result?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>We are a fair and reasoning people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>We have looked into the condition of the <name>Negro</name>, as described by the novelist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>We have &#x0022;realized&#x0022; the &#x0022;institution. &#x0022; We have apprehended the greatness of the facts, and ask ourselves, &#x0022;What can be done?&#x0022; We have compared the evil with evils of our own, and reflected with what difficulty we get over &mdash; if we do get over &mdash; our own social mischiefs and scandals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>There is no use in violent language, we say to ourselves; what is to be done?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>That is the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>We have, too, been made aware, and have had it brought home to our conscience, that we consume largely slave grown cotton, and sugar, and coffee, and that the very paper on which a <num value="1000000">million</num> copies of <hi rend="italics"><persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Tom</foreName></persName>'s Cabin</hi> were spread over this country was made from slave produce. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/> Returning thus to our senses, to our reason, and to our conscience, we have come to take a much quieter view of the &#x0022;domestic institution.&#x0022; We feel for the slaves, but we feel also for the masters, and we have satisfied ourselves that it does no good to the former to abuse the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>We are aware, too, that slavery was a British bequest to the <name>States</name>. --All these considerations apply quite as much, and more nearly by several degrees to the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/><dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct> not this quarrel give way to a calm, in which the real difficulties of the question will be met and quietly answered?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>It is too true that the commerce of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> is almost, if not quite, as much committed to slavery as its agriculture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>For what would New York be without slavery?-- But, what, alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>Cannot all the partners in this business put their heads together, shake hands over the quarrel, and think what can be done to mitigate what it is so difficult to abolish?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>Perhaps we speak to the deaf, but anything is better than dividing State against State, house against house, and servant against master, in the most rising nation in the world. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/> There is much interest felt here as to the course of the contractors on the railroads, the coming year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>The low price of State stocks, it is feared, will compel them to suspend operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>In that case, there are on the <rs>Central</rs> terminus, and the <rs>Covington</rs> and <orgName n="Ohio Railroad" type="railroad">Ohio Railroad</orgName>, some <num value="1000">thousands</num> of laborers, (it is supposed numbering with their families <num value="5000">five thousand</num>,) who will be deprived of the means of living, and a great deal of suffering will be the consequence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>The contractors are, I believe, without exception, excellent and honorable gentlemen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>They will do all in their power to continue their contracts, and have already made heavy sacrifices to do this.--I am sure they are actuated in a great degree by their sympathy for the laborers, and that they will make yet heavier sacrifices to keep them from suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>Should the laborers submit to a small reduction temporarily in their compensation, this may be accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>I say <hi rend="italics">temporarily;</hi> for I trust we are not to continue in our present condition of uncertainty, and our securities are not to remain depreciated for any long period of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>It is to be hoped that our difficulties will be settled and the country placed upon a permanent basis in a short time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>When that is done, everything will suddenly resume its former position of order and stability, and their values be restored to property of all kinds. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>The <rs>Major</rs> undertook the task himself, and performed it very well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>He then gave them the presents, which they received with perfect delight.--They assembled around the <rs>Major</rs> and cheered him with their tiny voices until they made the mountains ring with the echoes of their joyful exclamations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>The scene was deeply interesting, and <num value="1">one</num> which the children will never forget.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>How little importance the world attaches to a scene like this of kindness to children &mdash; to children of the poor laborer!

<head>Still more about dogs.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/> A deep gloom seems to have settled on everything around us. The near prospect of troubles &mdash; the beginning of which we shall all, the end of which we shall none of us see, seems to have dried up the very fountains of mirth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>To smile, seems strange and unnatural; to laugh, is almost impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>We have a divine warrant for saying that the house of mourning is better than the house of mirth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>We have none for considering it more agreeable.--Seeing, however, that it is so, we are all better off than we ever were before, since never before was there such cause for mourning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>It may sound harsh and discordant to strike, at this moment, any other key than that which brings forth a note of lamentation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>But the human mind needs relief, and human sorrow cannot last forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>To divert our own wretched feelings, and to call away the attention of our readers, if but for a moment, from a subject of unlimited distress, we have determined to write another chapter on dogs.--They are more important personages than seems to be generally imagined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>They gave name to a school of philosophers, (Cynics,) we think somewhat unjustly.--The Cynics seem to have been mere snarlers, while dogs, in general, are something much better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>The Cynics spent their lives in mocking at man. Dogs are the most faithful companions that man has. The Cynics were cold-hearted, cold-blooded, selfish, and indifferent to all suffering but their own. The dog is warm-hearted, unselfish, sympathetic, feels his master's sufferings more than his own, will risk his life in his defence, and has been known to follow him into prison, to go with him to the scaffold, to lie down on his grave, and to die of a broken heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>Greatly superior, then is the dog to the <name>Cynic</name>, and nothing can be more palpable than the misnomer.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/> Pride, we are told, goes before a fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/><rs type="role2">Prince</rs> experienced the truth of this maxim to his sorrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>Like others of his rank, he became a wanderer, and died in exile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>He was ambitious, and could not confine himself to a narrow sphere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>Nothing would do, but he must see the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>So <num value="1">one</num> fine morning he leaped into the cars, and went to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, to look, no doubt, after his brethren in both Houses of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>But, alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>he was soon destined to feel the pressure of poverty in a strange land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>He had innumerable accomplishments &mdash; he could waltz like a <hi rend="italics">dansense</hi> of the theatre &mdash; he could be sent back any distance to find anything that was lost &mdash; he could sit up straight in a chair &mdash; he could run and leap over a stick or horsewhip &mdash; he could catch his tail in his mouth &mdash; he could do many other things at the word of command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>But he fell into the hands of a man who did not appreciate his talents or never called them forth, for he was too proud to volunteer any exhibition of them &mdash; We were walking, <num value="1">one</num> morning, on the canal in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>We felt something cold touch our hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>We turned around and beheld &mdash; <rs type="role2">Prince</rs>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>yes! the identical <rs>Prince</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/> &#x0022;But, oh!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>how fallen, how changed.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/> He looked thin and gaunt, like a wolf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>His demeanor was humble, downcast and fawning &mdash; his gait was slouching and stealthy &mdash; his eye had lost all its fire, his carriage all its pride &mdash; he was the very picture of fallen greatness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>We thought of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><foreName>Charles</foreName> <genName n="10">X</genName></persName>.</hi> and the <name>Dey</name> of <placeName key="tgn,7001314" n="1.000 1" reg="alger,el djazair,al-jaza'ir,africa">Algiers</placeName>, of the <rs type="place">House</rs> of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00141" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,nomatch:0"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName></hi> and the <rs type="place">House</rs> of <hi rend="smallcaps"><rs n="Bourbon" type="royalfamily">Bourbon</rs></hi>--of Beau <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Hickman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00142" reg="mostcommon:Hickman,nomatch:0"><surname>Hickman</surname></persName></hi> and genius generally in distress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>None of them were ever more seedy or disconsolate &mdash; none gave more unmistakable symptoms of the gentleman under a cloud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>He evidently knew us, and as evidently begged that we would follow him to his home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>We did so, and found he resided in the house of a man who sold liquor &mdash; as they call such a man in <placeName key="tgn,7007522" n="1.000 7" reg="mississippi">Mississippi</placeName> &mdash; a doggery keeper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>We enquired about him, and we found he had been asked for, but a fabulous price had been demanded for him, and so it was no bargain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>This was the last we ever saw of poor <rs type="role2">Prince</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>His history encloses a moral quite as good as many a <num value="1">one</num> we have seen tacked on to the end of a less striking story. </p>

He slept by a coal fire and there were no puppies to whip.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>But he was in the habit of waking up a servant girl, who slept in the same room, and making her put on the coal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion, when she attempted to leave the room without doing it, he interposed between her and the door, and would not let her go out until it was done. </p>
