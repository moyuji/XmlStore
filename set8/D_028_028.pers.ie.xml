<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> Some of the <rs>Northern</rs> journals profess to look with more toleration upon certain Southern States than others.--They do not place <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> in the same category with the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>They are pleased to remark that these States were among the last that came into the contest, and that <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> had often interposed her influence under the old Government to prevent collisions like the present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>They single out <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> as the ring leader of this riot &mdash; an old offender, who had long been seeking to make mischief in the happy family. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> We shall not stop to show that the original disunion State of the old Confederacy was <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>She was in favor of disunion so long ago as the last war. Her Legislature passed secession resolutions as late as the annexation of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>It was in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, long before Southern Secession, that the compact of the <rs>Union</rs> was openly declared &#x0022;a compact with Hell.&#x0022; Practical nullification existed in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> long before Southern Secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The restoration of the <rs>Union</rs> is the last thing that, even now, <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> desires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>It spits upon the idea of any renewal of that alliance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>It deprecates, above all other evils, a return to the old order of things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>It will not so much as hear of receiving the <rs>South</rs> on the old terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/><placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> then ought to be the chief object of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> love and affection, instead of denunciation and hate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> We, too, on our part, can make a discrimination among our enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Badly as the <rs>North</rs> has behaved in general, we recognize, without difficulty, the motive influence of the war in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> <persName><foreName>Puritanism</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>It was the ascendancy of its turbulent and ferocious spirit in the councils of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> which precipitated this war, and which has imparted to it its peculiar horrors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The motives of the <rs>Middle States</rs> and the <rs>Western</rs> are an entirely different kind of humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Even the <rs>Masonic Lodges</rs> of the <rs>South</rs> are not recognized by the same order in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>A <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> General in the <rs>South</rs> lately destroyed Masonic property and refused to make any reparation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>His superior officer, a Western <persName n="Mason,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Mason,nomatch:0"><surname>Mason</surname></persName>, compelled him to do so. The Middle States and the <rs>West</rs> would hail with joy reconstruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/><placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> demands subjugation.--Nay more, its clergy clamor for extermination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/><placeName reg="The Boston">The Boston</placeName> <hi rend="italics">Recorder,</hi> a leading religious paper, edited by clergymen, and enjoying a large circulation, alludes to the danger to which the &#x0022;loyal&#x0022; North is exposed &#x0022;from selfish desires for peace&#x0022; and from being &#x0022;too ready to take the <name>Divine</name> prerogative of forgiveness into our own hands, as if we were more merciful than <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and pardon those dreadful offenders whom the <rs>Lord</rs>, in mercy to posterity, has delivered to us to destroy.&#x0022; The Recorder proceeds to quote the example of <persName n="Saul,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Saul,nomatch:0"><surname>Saul</surname></persName>, who was reproved by the people for not utterly exterminating the wicked <rs>Amalekite</rs>, including the women and children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>This the <rs>Recorder</rs> regards as a case in point, illustrating the dreadful iniquity of permitting any human being in the <rs>South</rs> to live and breathe. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> No! not in a steeple crowned hat, etc., but the same animal notwithstanding.--The wolf, dressed in sheep's clothing, or in the raiment of Little Red Riding <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName>'s grandmother, is none the less a wolf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>This horrible perversion and distortion of the <name>Scripture</name>, to justify the most abominable crimes, was always characteristic of <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritans</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>When you tell them that the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> sanctions slavery, they scornfully reply,--falsely, of course,--that this was only under the Old Dispensation, adapted to the infamy of a barbarous nation, but that the <name>Gospel</name> has introduced a new law,--&#x0022;Do unto others as ye would that others should do unto you.&#x0022; But when they want a pretext for the indulgence of the most vindictive and ferocious passions, they arrogate to themselves the attributes of the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of Justice, punishing, under the Old Dispensation, all indulgence to idolaters and criminals, and conveniently forget the &#x0022;Do unto others,&#x0022; etc., of the <name>Gospel</name> &mdash; that Gospel which proclaims,--&#x0022;A new commandment, I give unto you, that ye love <num value="1">one</num> another.&#x0022; </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> A contemporary speaks of an idea said to be entertained by some persons, that it would be a good thing to make proposals to the <name>Governments</name> of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> to sell out the whole Confederate establishment, &#x0022;lock, stock and barrel,&#x0022; together with its interest in national independence and in the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>, as the <hi rend="italics">dernier resort</hi> against Federal subjugation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> It is altogether too early in the day to consider such a proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The Confederacy is not yet exactly in the situation of &#x0022;Japheth in search of a Father.&#x0022; When that time has come, we can have an auctioneer's block raised in the <rs type="place">Capitol Square</rs>,--perhaps the <rs>Washington Monument</rs> would answer the purpose,--and some gentleman experienced in disposing of &#x0022;most elegant and desirable property, ancient family mansions, fine orchards, never-failing springs,&#x0022; etc., employed to do the &#x0022;Going &mdash; going &mdash; gone.&#x0022; The live stock, <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">black</rs>, to go with the estate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Specimens of these, including the various public functionaries, civil and military, portly country gentlemen, and members of the <rs type="place">City</rs> Councils, men of all estates and all colors, should be congregated about the auctioneer, to enable the bidders to make a personal inspection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>It would be a picturesque spectacle; and if the day were good, so as to allow of photographing, it would be a picture that every man present might hand down with pride and pleasure as an heirloom to his posterity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> If such an estate and such stock would not sell, the world has become indifferent to &#x0022;elegant property&#x0022; and blooded animals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/> For toilettes de visite, moire, satin, faille silk (that is unwatered moire), taffetas antique, and velvet, are much worn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>The figured morires are still in fashion, and require very little trimming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Passementerie with beads is much worn with silk; fur, lace or feather trimming is more suitable for satin and velvet. </p> </q><bibl n="Le Follet"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/> Double skirts are often seen, either for visiting, dinner or ball dress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>If closed all round, they are generally looped up; if open, the openings are at the back, as well as at the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>In many cases these skirts are made of different colors and materials, such as moire or satin over velvet, or <num value="2">two</num> shades of the same color.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>This fashion of wearing double skirts is much adopted for ball dresses, the underskirt generally being white and the tunic of color.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>The low body, with coat hasques, will be much worn if <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> the dress is of silk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>This corsage can be made of black velvet, handsomely trimmed with jet beads or seed pearls. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>The sorties de bal have not altered much in form, the circular being the favorite shape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>This, if made in white plush, with a thick Hama or chenille fringe, is very elegant and suitable to the seasons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Many opera cloaks that we have seen were of scarlet, trimmed with black lace, or embroidered in <rs type="color">black</rs> and <rs type="color">white</rs> floss silks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>The little hoods, now worn over the <rs n="head dress" type="product">head-dress</rs> during the transit to and from the carriage, are very pretty, and in many cases becoming. --We give the preference to the <rs>Marie Stuart</rs> shape, with a deep curtain falling over the shoulders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>If these are made in lace or some transparent materials, they are, of course, lined to match the dress or cloak which they accompany. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/> Mantles of velvet pile or cloth are trimmed with passementerie or the curly <rs>Astrakan</rs>; other furs and feather ornaments being reserved for velvet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>Beaded passementerie is very successfully employed with guipure on both dresses and cloaks. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>This season the cloaks are edged with a deep band of fur; the revers, collar and epaulette are also of fur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>Small epaulette and cuffs of the same fur.--This paletot was lined with quilted white silk, and was intended to be worth with a violet velvet dress, trimmed with a band of Chinchilla, carried round the skirt and up the back seam.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>The opera cloak, to be worn with this dress, of Yak lace, over mave silk. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/> Another was of black tulle, over black satin, with <num value="4">four</num> bouillounes of the same; on these were fastened small bunches of gold grapes and leaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>These bouillonnes were continued quite up the front breadth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>Over this skirt was a tunic of black satin, open in front and very long behind, embroidered all round in gold embroidery of grapes and leaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>The body was of black tulle and satin, with ornaments of gold grapes on the shoulders. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>The wide waistbands so much in favor a little while ago are rapidly disappearing, and giving place to those of a medium-size.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>When the wide ones are used, they are mostly fastened at the back or sides with a rosette instead of a buckle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>The sashes are still fastened in the same manner, and have very wide ends. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/> We have seen <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> lace coats, intended to be worn over low bodies.--<num value="1">One</num> of the low black velvet bodies intended for evening wear had no sleeves, and was pointed at the top and bottom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>This body was intended to be worn over a white satin dress, trimmed with black lace and pearls. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>There is no alteration in the form of cuffs and collars at present; they are still embroidered with <rs type="color">white</rs> or <rs type="color">colored</rs> bees, butterflies, <hi rend="italics">flours de lis,</hi> etc. The most fashionable ornament at the present moment is in the shape of a swallow. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/> Crests and initials are sometimes embroidered on cuffs and collars, as well as handkerchiefs, the latter being very handsome, though our <hi rend="italics">elegantes</hi> have at length understood that these articles are for the pocket, and so longer display them in the hand. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/> Small veils are much worn, and appear likely to continue in favor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/> We are very happy to see the decided return of necklaces; they are not confined to evening wear, but accompany morning toilets, though, of course, in a modified form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>The long chains of beads have become excessively vulgar; <num value="1">one</num> row close round the throat, with a medallion, is sometimes worn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>But the most elegant of these collars are of plain ribbon velvet, fastened with a shape, and ornamented with <rs n="gold coin" type="product">gold coins</rs>, small sprays of steel-work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>Cameo or portrait medallions are much worn; they are suspended from the collar or from a small chain. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>The vestes <rs>Russes</rs> are much in fashion; they are made for either simple or elegant toilets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>We have seen several dresses of moire or light satin, made with these jackets, accompanied by the chemisette <rs>Russes</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>These, if intended to be worn with silk or dressy materials, are made of tulle, or very fine muslin, with lace insertions; or with trills of lace and open-work insertions, in which are cerise colored velvets.
