<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/> The elements have proclaimed an armistice which will ensure a suspension of campaigning for the next <measure n="5months" type="date">five months</measure>. In the meantime let us hope that the <rs>Congress</rs> of our Confederacy will not permit the appropriate season to pass without the enactment of such laws as will recruit our wasted armies and exhaust our depleted treasury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>If we mean to make good our claims to independence, we must strike bold and decisive blows during the ensuing <rs type="season">spring</rs> and <rs type="season">summer</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>This we can only do by bringing every available able-bodied young man to the field this winter, and devising such schemes as will ensure the army and the people a sufficiency of bread and meat to subsist upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>These are the topics of legislation which must be fairly met and fully overcome, in order to our success in the all-important campaign of the coming summer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>The sentiment of the army is decidedly in favor of bringing out the principals who have furnished substitutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>The whole army, I think, would submit graciously to the bill of <persName n="Miles,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00042" reg="mostcommon:Miles,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Miles</surname></persName>, conscripting them for the war, even in their present organizations, if the men who have furnished substitutes are only included in the bill, or are reached by proper legislation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> The roads, as I mentioned before, are all undergoing thorough repair, and in some cases will be planked; in others they will be thoroughly covered with stone and made quite serviceable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>For this purpose heavy details are made daily from almost every regiment in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>The attention now being paid to the roads and the present condition of transportation make it a matter quite certain that we shall be able to keep the animals in much better order than they were kept last winter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/> Large quantities of baled hay arrive every day, and I should suppose that if proper attention has been paid to the taking care of the tax in kind that an abundance of long food could be readily obtained for the animals this winter. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>The good folks at home, in many instances, are not forgetting the gallant boys in the field, as the number of boxes arriving too plainly tell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>I saw <num value="1">one</num> box come to hand on yesterday containing, according to present valuation in Confederate currency, not less than <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">six hundred dollars'</measure> worth of good things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>And who, think you, kind reader, sent it to this gallant boy in the held?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Why, if I must tell, it was his betrothed, and then the note that accompanied it was much more highly prized than all else which that box contained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Who would not have a sweetheart? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/> The system of permanent furloughs instituted in this army in <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct> last is working like a charm, and desertions are much less numerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>But, at the same time, it may be well to observe that the military discipline is, if anything, more stringent than ever, and little or no leniency can be expected for those who abandon their country's standard. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>It is expected that the navy can reduce the works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>In that case you will, after their capture, leave a sufficient garrison in them to render them perfectly secure; and it is recommended that on the upward passage a few heavy guns and some troops be left at the pilot station, at the forks of the river, to recover a retreat in case of a disaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/> Leather in the <rs>Confederacy</rs> has become so scarce as to render it exceedingly doubtful whether the army can be shod comfortably the present winter.

Bulletin"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/> Let us look at the figures and see if we have not been guilty of <unclear>wof</unclear> neglect to provide the country, and the army especially, with leather, and also if there has not been a <unclear>sinful</unclear> waste of the enormous amount of raw material offered us by the very necessities of war. We allude to the raw hides which accumulated in the army, and which certainly must have been wasted, else we cannot account for the <unclear>ability</unclear> of labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>Take <num value="1">one</num> brigade as an instance: It kills <num value="7">seven</num> beeves <num value="5">five</num> mornings in each work. (<num value="2">Two</num> mornings bacon is issued.) The brigade contains an estimate of <num value="1500">fifteen hundred</num> men. That would make <num value="35">35</num> beef hides per week; <unclear></unclear> per month, and <num value="1680">1,680</num> hides during the year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>Each hide will make <num value="7">seven</num> pairs of shoes, from No. <unclear></unclear> <num value="10">No. 10</num>, which would make in <num value="1">one</num> year for each brigade <num value="11700">11,700</num> shoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>Say there are <num value="3">three</num> brigade to <num value="1">one</num> division and we would have <num value="35280">35,280</num> shoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>In short, there are enough beeves killed in our army to afford hides sufficient, if taken care offend tanned, to shoe our army entirely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>And this estimate is made out in reference to the present time, when nothing like the number of beeves are killed as in the <unclear>caroler</unclear> stages of the war. And yet at present we are suffering for leather, and many soldiers and citizens are without shoes, and without the leather with which to make them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>And the heartless shoe-makers (and they are in general the worst extortioners of the <rs>South</rs>) cannot procure any leather on account of the <rs>Government</rs> having taken all the leather in the country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/> Now, we must conclude that there has been a great waste of green hides, and it is a matter of sufficient importance to enlist the attention of our Government to the necessity of saving them.--Surely there has been a reckless waste, and had proper attention been given to the subject at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> there would have been a plentiful supply of leather in the <rs>South</rs> this day. We speak from a personal observation of <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> when we aver that the unnecessary waste and neglect in this respect by military commanders is really culpable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>Since this war commenced we calculate, at a rough estimate, but below rather than above the real figures, that enough leather could have been tanned from the green hides of beeves killed in our army to have made over <num value="20000000">twenty millions</num> of shoes! </p> </div3>
