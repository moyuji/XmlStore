<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>Of these, no doubt, he imported many from <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, but many more he got from the stables of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> gentlemen.
