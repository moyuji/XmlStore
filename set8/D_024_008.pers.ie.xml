<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/> But pre-eminent above all other tyrants since the days of the <rs>Egyptian</rs> despot, as <persName n="Milroy,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00197" reg="mostcommon:Milroy,nomatch:0"><surname>Milroy</surname></persName> has shown himself by these acts; neither he nor his foreign myrmidons are as despicable and villainous as the native traitors, who play the part of pilot fish to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> sharks, guide him to his prey, and instigate him to fresh acts of persecution and ferocity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>And this is not only true of <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>, but of every part of the <rs>South</rs> where the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have penetrated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>Whilst happily the number of disloyal persons in the <rs>South</rs> is small, they make up in vindictiveness what they lack in strength, and whenever an opportunity offers, surpass the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> in cruelty to the loyal people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>It matters not that they themselves have received toleration and indulgence from the <rs>Southern Government</rs>, and from Southern citizens; that they have not been arrested and thrown for years into prison, as <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00198" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> treats men and women suspected of disloyalty in the <rs>North</rs>; that, instead of this, they have in many cases made large fortunes out of the war and the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>The very moment a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army gets possession of their town or section they turn upon the loyal portion of the community with the malignity of fiends, and if the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> relax for a day their habitual ferocity, complain of them at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> as negligent of the duty they owe to &#x0022;the <rs>Union</rs>.&#x0022; Of all the despicable dogs in human shape whom this war has developed, none are so bloody and base as those Southern traitors, whom toleration and clemency only make more <unclear>uculent</unclear> and outrageous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>The blackest <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, in comparison with these irredeemable knaves, is as white as the driven snow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>, bad as he is, is not a traitor to his own home, and does not seek the destruction of his own section, the ruin of its interests, and the humiliation of its honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>But these wretches, knowing that they are a miserable minority of the <rs>Southern</rs> community, and in the face of the horrid cruelties and abominations practiced and threatened by <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> despotism against the people of the <rs>South</rs>, turn their poisoned, viperous fangs against their persecuted country, and hound on the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> to greater crimes against their own kith and kin than even <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> diabolism had ever conceived. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/> In this respect the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> has proved that he is the same animal with his <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> forefathers in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>The sect of <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritans</rs> which grew up under <persName><foreName>Elizabeth</foreName></persName>, and expanded prodigiously under <persName><foreName>James</foreName></persName>, had already become sufficiently great under <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName></persName> to turn the scale in the contest with his Parliament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>The time was, beyond all things, opportune for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>Real, numerous, and mighty grievances existed, and it became necessary to lop them off, even at the expense of civil war. These grievances were religious as well as political; and this fact gave the <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritans</rs> an opportunity which they did not neglect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>They had the power to turn the whole struggle into a religious war, and when the throne fell they remained in the ascendant. --Their tyranny was so hateful that they soon succumbed under a military despotism, and when that was over <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> submitted the most degrading Government that ever reduced a proud nation to a <hi rend="italics">nonentity</hi> for <measure n="25years" type="date">twenty-five years</measure> rather than attempt to overthrow it. They feared a Republic, because they associated the name with <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> ascendancy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>They hate the name of republic to this very day, notwithstanding a vast majority of the people must have been <rs n="Republican" type="political">republicans</rs> at the commencement of the great civil war. The <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritans</rs> got possession of the <rs>Government</rs>, and they were just as unable to manage it then as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are to administer their present Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>Both fell instantly under military despotism as soon as they under took to manage the <rs>Republic</rs>. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/> The <rs>North</rs> ought by this time to be satisfied that its cherished scheme of Southern subjugation is the wildest delusion that ever took possession of the mind of a reasoning people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>In fact, it is weaker, financially, morally, and physically, whilst the <rs>South</rs> has been growing stronger every day. So far from having exhausted itself by its efforts, its resources have increased, its munitions of war are far more abundant, and its military appliances more perfect than when the war began.
