<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/> The visit of the <rs>President</rs> to the <rs>South</rs> has find a cheering effect on the <rs>Southern</rs> army and people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>It has attested the profound personal interest which the <rs type="role" reg="Chief Magistrate">Chief Magistrate</rs> feels in all portions of the beleaguered Confederacy, and has kindled afresh that fire of enthusiasm which always burns brighter when the person of a great Chief is brought in contact with the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>No man has as strong a hold on the confidence and affections of the country than the man whom she called with entire unanimity to the principal guidance of her affairs, and no man better deserves it. If he has committed errors, that is only to say that he in human.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>Where should we have found the perfect man?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>If there are others who would have avoided these errors, what guarantee have we that they would not have committed others of a more serious character?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>The whole world attests the wisdom and energy of <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00163" reg="mostcommon:Davis,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>'s Administration, and his very enemies concede that he is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> statesman of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>Critics may speak of what has not been accomplished, but they do not inform us when before in the history of the world as much has been accomplished with as limited means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>The single fact that, after <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> of a gigantic war, the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, struggling against the most enormous odds, is not only unconquered, but stronger than she was at the beginning of the contest, is proof enough that no ordinary hand holds the helm of State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>When a feeble ship is so handled by her commander as to outlive the most terrific tornado that ever swept the seas, and still breasts the mountain waves with a buoyant keel, we may believe that a consummate seaman walks her quarter deck, and refuse to give up our confidence in him because now and then a spar has been carried away, or a tremendous billow occasionally swept over her decks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>She still &#x0022;walks the waters like a thing of life,&#x0022;and her storm-beaten flag waves proudly at her masthead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>For all this we should be grateful to Heaven, and render all due praise to her sagacious and indomitable navigator. </p>

<head>The troops Mustered in by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.</head>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/> We republished yesterday an extract from an exchange paper in which it was stated that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had sent to the field <num value="1276246">1,276,246</num> volunteers, of which <num value="1068000">1,068,000</num> were <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>There probably never was an army of the same size that accomplished so little in so great a space of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>Their task was to conquer a country containing about <num value="9000000">9,000,000</num> of inhabitants, of which <num value="4000000">4,000,000</num> were slaves, and not capable of being used as soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>Nay, they have actually themselves levied, and are at this moment levying, large bodies of troops from that portion of the population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>They have during the whole war possessed unlimited resources in money and material.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>They have enjoyed absolute dominion of the sea. They possess over us a superiority of resources such as ought to have enabled them to conquer us, even though they had not been <num value="0.5">one-half</num> our number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>Had the <rs>Confederates</rs> possessed their fleet, their power of manufacturing and importing cannon and small arms, their commerce, and their money, they would have been in New York long age. Never were such enormous resources used to so poor a purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>The spirit of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> is unbroken &mdash; the balance of victory has been greatly on their side; their enemy never has gained any advantage over them except by means of his fleet; they have beaten him in every pitched battle but <num value="1">one</num>, and that was a drawn battle; they are this day stronger, more united, more confident, and in every respect more formidable than they were <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> ago. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/> But how is it with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>? <persName n="Seymour,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00166" reg="mostcommon:Seymour,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Seymour</surname></persName> says that the great <placeName reg="New York" key="tgn,7007568">State of New York</placeName> did not furnish <num value="8000">8,000</num> men towards the filling up of the late draft for <num value="300000">300,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>Only <num value="1">one</num> conscript out of <num value="19">nineteen</num> could be obtained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>The truth, no doubt, is, and we hear it confirmed by every person who has lately been to the <rs>North</rs>, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are in a state of far greater exhaustion than we are, and <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00168" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> is at his wit's end to get recruits. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/> It is not well, however, to depend on the weakness of our adversary.
