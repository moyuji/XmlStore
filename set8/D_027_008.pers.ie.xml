<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> From <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> we learn that everything continues quiet in front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The enemy yesterday refused to respond to some shots from the artillery on our side, and we are informed that not a shell was thrown into the city up to the time the train left in the afternoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>There are various conjectures as to this sudden passiveness on the part of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>It is quite true that the weather is hot enough to satisfy any reasonable people, without increasing the calorie temperature by means of powder and ball, but the present quiet state of affairs hardly results from any atmospheric cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>It is possible that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> apprehend some retaliation from the <rs>Confederates</rs>, and have concluded to suspend the barbarous practice of shelling <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> until future events are revealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Meanwhile, the summer is fleeting away, and <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Gen,,,:1"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> has suffered works to elapse without advancing a single step towards the &#x0022;back door&#x0022; of the <unclear></unclear>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Prisoners represent that the cavalry arm of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> service, since the operations on the north side of the <rs>James</rs> and south side of the <rs>Appomattox</rs>, is in a &#x0022;used up&#x0022; condition, and will not now number more than <num value="1">one</num>- <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> of its strength at the commencement of the campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>It will be remembered that <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName> was reported to have been detached from <orgName n="army"><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Gen,,,:1"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, and sent to some unknown point &mdash; <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, according to rumor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The enemy are occupying their leisure time in foraging upon the country below <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, and are said to have completely destroyed the limited crops in that section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>It is to be expected that the counties open to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> troops will be desolated and ruined. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/> The ostensible <hi rend="italics">design</hi> of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00225" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Gen,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, in sending our parties of horsemen through the country, is to cut the railroads and destroy our communications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>The <hi rend="italics">effect</hi> is, whether so intended or not, (and we believe it to be so intended,) to subject a large district of country to the absolute dominion of organized robbers, with arms in their hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>These men care nothing for the destruction of the railroads &mdash; that is a matter of secondary importance &mdash; their object is plunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>They are as much thieves and house breakers as any that are daily prosecuted in our cities for those offences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>They act in utter violation of all law, and deserve no protection from any law. They should not be treated as prisoners of war. They are not soldiers.--They go not forth to fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>Their mission is plunder, and, if resisted, murder.--They seek not out our armed hosts, with whom they may do battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>They avoid our soldiers as they would avoid pestilence. --Their Government protects them in the commission of deeds which every day, in other communities, brings some culprit to the gallows or consigns him to the penitentiary. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/> We are led to these observations not by the frequent occurrence of robbery and murder in the country &mdash; for these have become too common to deserve notice &mdash; but by the fact of our attention having been called to <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num></hi> particular case, (not worse, we dare say, than hundreds of others,) in which we happened to know the parties, and which occurred in the county of <placeName reg="Mecklenburg, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002173">Mecklenburg</placeName> during the late marauding expedition of <persName n="Kantz,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00226" reg="nearbymention:Kantz,Gen,,,"><surname>Kantz</surname></persName> and <persName n="Wilson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00227" reg="nearbymention:Wilson,Margaret,,,"><surname>Wilson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>A body of plunderers rode up to the house of the gentleman in question, whooping and yelling like drunken savages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>On the way they fell in with a youth, who was the son of a lady staying at the house, a relative of the family, and ordered him to halt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>Instead of halting, the lad (he was about <measure n="13years" type="date">thirteen years</measure> old) fled to a neighboring wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>The scoundrels fired at this mere child some half dozen or more shots, evidently with the design to kill him, for the shots whistled all around him. Having failed in their purpose, they pushed on to the house, yelling, cursing and swearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>There were none there but females, the gentleman of the house being absent, and these they treated with the grossest brutality, pointing pistols to their heads, and demanding money, watches, jewelry, clothing, and everything else that could be sold for money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>They demanded the keys to every closet, cellar, bureau, bookcase, desk, or chest in the house, and when they were not immediately produced, they broke them open with stones or the andirons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>They stole a box containing all the silver belonging to the family, and valued at <num value="12">twelve</num> or <measure n="15000dollars" type="currency">fifteen thousand dollars</measure>. They took the rings from the fingers of the ladies, and the watches from their pockets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/><num value="1">One</num> lady entreated them to spare a ring which was the gift of a dying mother, but they refused.--They insisted on carrying off a favorite servant woman, but she became so much alarmed that she ran off and hid herself, nor were they able to find her. Upon this they became furious, and threatened to shoot the lady of the house, and the lady visitor before alluded to, if she were not produced, and it was through the mercy of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> that they were not shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing they asked for was saddles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>They destroyed all the saddles to prevent pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>The next was whiskey. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/> This party at last took their leave, to be succeeded in an hour by another worse than the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>In the course of the day, the house was visited by no less than <num value="5">five</num> different parties of marauders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>Of the <num value="4">four</num> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, each succeeding <num value="1">one</num> was worse than the last had been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>The faith pretended to be much scandalized at the proceedings of their predecessors, probably because they had left them nothing to steal, and said they had acted in utter violation of orders &mdash; a plain proof that the officers either could not or would not restrain them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>They carried off <num value="7">seven</num> young, athletic, valuable negro men, much against their inclination, as is proved by the fact that <num value="5">five</num> of them escaped and returned to their master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/><num value="1">One</num> of the gang boasted that he could take <num value="8">eight</num> men, and ride any where through the country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/> We publish the above details not so much for their novelty as for the facts which they reveal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>These marauding parties have no officers, or at least if they have, they do not obey them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>Clearly, therefore, they are not soldiers, or entitled to the treatment of soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>Anybody who wishes to recruit a score or <num value="2">two</num> of banditti can do it at a moment's warning in <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00228" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Gen,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>The boast of the fellow who boasted that he could ride through the country with <num value="8">eight</num> men, proves, clearly enough, what the inducements are. They are impunity and plunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>They know that if they be taken loaded down with gold watches and silver spoons, in sight of the burning farm-houses and granaries that they have plundered and destroyed, they will be treated with all the tenderness due to veterans of unstained character, who have been captured after a siege of <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure>. But let them know that there is danger in such enterprises &mdash; let them be shot down like dogs wherever caught &mdash; let the brothers and sons of the outraged farmer who are fighting in our ranks agree to take no prisoners, and we shall soon hear that banditti of this description can no longer be found to volunteer.--They are all cowards, and when they find that they are apter to get hard knocks than anything else for their pains, they will beg leave to be excused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>There is no need to embarrass the <rs>Government</rs> about this matter. </p> </div3>

<head>A Lofty sentiment.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/> On a recent occasion a great <rs type="role" reg="General">General</rs> of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> was presented by a young lady with a wreath of laurels, and the earnest hope expressed that he might continue to still and wear a great many. &#x0022;My dear cheat,&#x0022; was the reply, &#x0022;I have nothing to do with laurels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>I only desire to do my duty.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/> It was a sentiment worthy of any man who ever lived, and all who know him know that it is true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>We do not refer to it for the purpose of lauding the man who uttered it. We do not mention his name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>We give the sentiment for the reflection and imitation of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>Of all the weeds of vanity which to-day are, and to-morrow are cast into the oven, laurels are the most perishable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>Every spring time clothes the tree in beauty, and every autumn strews the earth with its dry leaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>Happy the man who is arrayed in <unclear></unclear> of virtue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>He only is truly great, the effulgence of whose name comes from within, like the sun, and is not the reflected glory of the moon, and who heads as little as the sun the light which be lavishly scatters over the <unclear>un</unclear> Men of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> order of <unclear></unclear> men who know at once how lotty <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> and how little they are, who, conscious of the august intelligence which entitles them to a high seat in the <unclear></unclear> space which intervene between them and the overarching firmament than that which separates them from the levels of life at their feet, are not likely to trouble them selves about laurels, and recall from the popular idolatry which to weaker spirits is the great object of human existence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/> The humblest soldier in the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern confederacy</orgName>, who is simply seeking to do his duty, is nobler than the highest officer who is actuated merely by the desire of making himself a name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>This allegiance to duty is the distinguishing quality and the imperishable glory of our Confederate rank and file.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>Strange, indeed, that any officer, in such a cause as this, should desire special praise for thinking of his country and not of himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>With all that makes life worth having at stake, and encircled by a host of warriors who are offering their blood like water without a dream of their own advantage, what must be the littleness of a south which can be absorbed in its own elevation, and can play off priceless life-pawns to win a game of ambition? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/> Yet, constituted as human nature is, we fear there must be those in every service who have no higher motive than their own glorification, and who carry self into all the complications of camp and council.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>Whilst no man can be great without an honorable ambition, that is not an honorable ambition which makes self, and not duty, the governing principle of action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>With duty as a guide &mdash; duty to the country, duty to principle &mdash; our cause would be placed on a basis of impregnable strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>Or, if it should fall, its fall would invoke no self-reproaches; it would not bereave us of fortitude, resignation, and dignity; we should not fall with it, but leave a name to live when we are dead, and from the ashes of our sepulchres transmit vital sparks to the hearts of oppressed humanity in every age. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
