<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> If I knew what news you are in possession of &mdash; If I only had <num value="4">four</num> file up to date &mdash; I would know better how and what to write.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>As it is. I must write in the dark, and I strongly suspect that my meagre facts will contract strikingly with the big rumors that abound in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> Allow me to make <unclear></unclear> of my trip hither, and to give you such <unclear> </unclear> either transpired or were ascertained as <unclear></unclear> I confederate feeling half anxious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>half promise, as I started from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> to over lake our army, which Invariably crossed into <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> a country's separated from us, and reached only with labor and <unclear></unclear>. A Gordonsville I found the pilgrimage field be made with ample company, for there were ragged privates and bedecked officers in abundance ready to start for the same destination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>While we were waiting for the <rs>Quartermaster</rs>'s train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Though he was soon recognized respectfully saluted by some, and regarded with interest by all, nothing in his manner, <unclear></unclear> that of the crowd, indicated the presence of a high official.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>I suppose <q>&#x0022;Old Abe&#x0022; </q> would have been <hi rend="italics">measuring,</hi> kissing women, and telling doubtful anecdotes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>I do not stop to speak of the other qualities of our Southern <rs type="role2">President</rs>, but I am glad he is a gentleman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>After tedious waiting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>I was <num value="1">one</num> of a crowd standing or sitting on blocks of wood in the close, dirty box cars, bound for <placeName reg="Rapidan Station">Rapidan Station</placeName>, from which the weary march was to be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>How strange the contrast to our former flying trips &mdash; through to <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> by <time value="4pm">4 o'clock P. M.</time> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> From the depot my companion and took our course towards <placeName reg="Culpeper Court House">Culpeper Court House</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>pursuing the route of our army when it attacked <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName> at <placeName key="tgn,2229381" n="1.000 504" reg="cedar mountain, culpeper, virginia">Cedar Run</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Nearing the battle field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>I found the country awfully laid waste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>This was done by the enemy, after we fell back, to avenge themselves for the whipping they got. What I saw of <hi rend="italics"><rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> farms</hi> on the battle field, and what I heard from the people, confirmed my opinion, expressed in my <unclear> tter</unclear> at the time, as to their great loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Just before reaching the <rs type="place">Court-House</rs> we were cautioned about proceeding beyond, as <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> cavalry were deserted to be running over the country, picking up soldiers and citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>This created quite a sensation with a squad near us, but we soon determined this to be <num value="1">one</num> of the rumors which darkens the very air now a days, and pushed on without a care.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>A long here we heard sundry items about the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and their doings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/><persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName> is described as being short and thick set, with thick hair and beard and very profane.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>A citizen asked him for protection against some great outrage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/><q>&#x0022;No sir,&#x0022; </q> replied the <rs>General</rs>, at the top of his voice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/><q>&#x0022;Go to the mountains and hide, I did not come here to protest d &mdash; d rebels.&#x0022;</q> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> stole nearly a <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">thousand dollars</measure> from a lady whose husband is an invalid, threatening her and her daughter with out rage if she did not give it up. When she complained to the <rs>General</rs> in command, he coolly dismissed her saying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>This is war, madam.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>You all have just begun to see it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> It was a problem where we could spend the night, as everywhere we were assured there was no grain in the country, and yet our horses must be fed. In this predicament, we were met by the amiable steward of <orgName n="the Poor House" type="org">the <hi rend="italics">poor house</hi></orgName>, who, seeing we had <hi rend="italics">no visit means of support,</hi> took us with him. He had saved a little corn for his establishment, and kindly gave us some.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>It was <num value="1">one</num> of my pleasures, as I slept in this humble place, to know that it was the birth-place of <num value="1">one</num> of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>'s most gifted and learned sons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>It is said that, on <num value="1">one</num> occasion some idle students on the <rs type="place">University</rs> lawn, were discoursing magniloquently as to their birth-places, when <num value="1">one</num> turned suddenly to him and said: <cit><q rend="inline">&#x0022;And where were you born?&#x0022;</q><bibl n="Virginia's"></bibl> </cit> <q>&#x0022;I? At <orgName n="the Poor House" type="org">the poor house</orgName>,&#x0022;</q> was his quick reply, scarcely looking up from the volume over which he was posing; and his auditors rebuked felt that it was better to ennoble a place, than to have a place <num value="1">one</num>'s chief honor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> And now, resuming our journey, we turned from our projected route via <placeName reg="Warrenton, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2114921">Warrenton</placeName> and <placeName reg="Leesburg, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2112647">Leesburg</placeName>, being directed to proceed to <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>On we go through <placeName reg="Culpeper, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2111394">Culpeper</placeName>, then through <placeName reg="Dunavant, Spotsylvania, Virginia" key="tgn,2111530">Rappahannock</placeName>-- This latter county has the rather unenviable reputation of having furnished an unusually large number of wealthy, prominent citizens to take the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> oath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>I see that a writer in <dateStruct><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct>'s <hi rend="italics"><rs n="Whig" type="political">Whig</rs></hi> apologized for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>They certainly gave aid and comfort to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>They were perfectly loyal to the <rs>South</rs>, were they?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Ah! had we many such loyal citizens, our enemy would be well pleased, our cause desperate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>I am not for doing anything to them, but I protect against their being put on the footing of those who stood by their opinions, and by their suffering, oppressed country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> On we go. The tedium of the journey is much relieved by passing so many soldiers <hi rend="italics">en route</hi> for the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Here is a lone fellow, there a couple, there squads of <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="20">twenty</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>You see them behind and before, far as the eye can reach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Some are marching on strong and cheerful, others jaded in body barefoot, foot-sore, and dispirited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Here are some sitting on a big rock, eating their crackers and raw middling; yonder are a dozen sleeping as only tired soldiers can sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>We can't pass a farm house that is not filled with them, getting reaches, pickle, buttermilk &mdash; anything there is to eat. Ah!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>there is a happy party that has chartered a wagon to take them and their traps to <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>, and they are as merry as though all their earthly troubles were over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Now we overtake a crowd not so fortunate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>They are wading the <rs>Shenandoah</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>A few pull off shoes, and roll up pantaloons, as they did in play when they were boys and not dreaming of war or sorrow; but the majority go right through with the indifference either of merriment or of sadness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>How strange that the most opposite causes make us alike oblivious of minor trials?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>All along the road, too, are broken-down and sick men, some in comfortable houses, but more in barns, stables, and forsaken dwellings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Now is the time for the good <rs>Samaritan</rs> to travel this road, and he will find his pennies, his beast, his on his kind words, and his intercessions, all useful. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> We heard <hi rend="italics">en route</hi> numerous and most startling rumors as to the progress and operations of our army, as, for instance, that <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> was in <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, that the <name>Secessionists</name> of that city had taken it without a struggle; that <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> had been evacuated, and that our victorious army was pressing on towards <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Had we believed half we heard, we must have renounced the idea of overtaking the army short of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>It was really amusing to notice how in the most remote and out of the way region we passed through, the most liberal rumors prevailed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> At <placeName reg="Front Royal, Warren, Virginia" key="tgn,2111870">Front Royal</placeName> they tell of their late <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">Provost Marshal</rs>, who, when he <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> arrived, was very impolite, and subsequently gave as his apology that he was utterly taken aback by finding so cool a reception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>He had expected to be welcomed, and, lot everybody was sorry to see him, and looked daggers at him Ill used <persName n="Unreasonable,Officer,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Unreasonable,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Officer">officer</roleName> <surname>Unreasonable</surname></persName> people, not to be glad to see <num value="1">one</num> coming on so benign a mission!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Similar to him were those <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> who, at the same place, said in all seriousness that it was <hi rend="italics">hard</hi> that <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> burnt the bridges, and made them rebuild them!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Please to put on record the heroism of <persName n="Kaufman,Miss,Sue,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="default:Kaufman,Sue,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <foreName>Sue</foreName> <surname>Kaufman</surname></persName>, of <placeName key="tgn,2112770" n="1.000 38" reg="luray, page, virginia">Luray</placeName>, who, when her father was in the enemy's hands, with only a brother of <measure n="12years" type="date">12 years</measure>, took all the negroes and horses, and escaped to a place of safety, spending <num value="2">two</num> nights in the mountains and passing quite near the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> pickets. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/> You have probably, are this, corrected your statement as to the burning of the <rs type="place">Taylor hotel</rs> in this place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>The fire was near the depot and adjoining the scene of the fire when the enemy evacuated the place last <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The town is crowded with soldiers who are being organized into regiments, preparatory to being sent to their respective commands.--Everything is as quite as in time of profound peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>No liquor can be find, and the men seem too tired to be other than orderly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Entering the town, I noticed the very extensive fortifications which the enemy erected during their last occupation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>They command all the important roads, and may be useful to us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> The citizens say the enemy behaved, if possible, much worse during their last stay than in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and relate many instances of their crucify.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/><num value="1">One</num> affected me. A young lady, who is a <hi rend="italics">cripple</hi> and an orphan, was taken by a party of soldiers, without sort, out to the fortifications, to answer to some charge, and was hurried along at the point of the bayonet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Appearing before the <rs>General</rs>, she asked what was the charge. &#x0022;You were overheard to say <num value="1000">thousand</num> <unclear></unclear> <q>&#x0022;Hush,&#x0022;</q> cried she, stamping her foot in <unclear></unclear>! &#x0022;Use not such language before me. Your Northern ladies may use such words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/> As far as we can understand the operations, from the very imperfect accounts which we have received, they were somewhat as follows: Our army in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> is divided into <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 3">three corps</orgName>, commanded by <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00093" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Generals</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, <persName n="Longstreet,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00094" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName> and <persName n="Hill,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00095" reg="nearbymention:Hill,D.,H.,,"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Hill</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/> You have no faith in the supernatural?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>I have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>You do not believe in necromancy, or astrology, or in the power of the evil eye?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>I do. The reason for this is, you are <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs>, descended from <name>English</name> ancestors, while I have <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> blood in my veins, and inherit a reverence for what you sneer at. Were a disembodied spirit to arise at my bedside to-night, I should question it, and own to being frightened, while you would throw a candlestick at its immaterial head, and insist to the last upon its being a burglar in disguise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>Yet, mark me, in spite of yourself, your hair would rise, and your blood curdle, and you would feel what you would not acknowledge for the world.--Bah!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>if such things have no existence, what do our strange shivering and shuddering mean?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>and why do we look about us with awe-stricken eyes when we pass graveyards after dusk?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/><hi rend="italics">You</hi> do not, you say. Are you sure of it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>I have never seen a ghost, and I cannot say that I desire the spectacle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>There must be an uncomfortable beating of the heart at such a sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>I doubt if many could retain both life and reason through such an ordeal. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/> I am a doctor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>Years ago I was very poor and very young.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>I came from my own country with my diploma, and nothing else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>I found that the great cities of the new world were full of doctors young and poor as I was. I left them and went westward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>I settled in the <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">State of Indiana</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>It was then <num value="1">one</num> great forest, with clearings here and there for fields of corn and rude log houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>Any <num value="1">one</num> led a hard life there, and a doctor's, it seemed to me, worst of all. Miles and miles of hard riding, through rain and mud, to visit patients who could pay nothing; miles back again, to steal a few moments of repose before another announcement of some <num value="1">one</num> being <q> &#x0022;very bad!&#x0022;</q> I was skin and bones in a twelvemonth, but that was nothing uncommon in that part of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>The only wonder is, that I did not have what they called <q> &#x0022;fever'n ager.&#x0022;</q> I was the only person free from it for <num value="50">fifty</num> square miles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>However, I prospered, after a certain fashion, and in a year or <num value="2">two</num> made a considerable local reputation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>The place was growing, and my spirits began to revive. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/> It was about this time that I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> saw my watch, to which all I have now to tell relates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>A cold night in <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> had set in. I was at supper in my little home, and enjoying it as only a hungry and weary man can enjoy for Don't ask what I had; it was <q>&#x0022;out west,&#x0022;</q> remember.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>Of course, there was a preparation of corn and a preparation of pork, and a preparation of whiskey; <rs n="corn meal" type="product">corn meal</rs>, pork, and whiskey are the staple articles <q>&#x0022;out west. &#x0022;</q> I was enjoying my supper, as I have said, and a loud knock at my door was not the most delightful sound which could have broken the silence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>However, I said <q>&#x0022;Come in ! &#x0022;</q> with as good a grace as possible, and a stranger entered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>He was a tall, broad- shouldered man, in the dress of a back woodsman, and his large features wore a troubled expression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>I saw at once that something serious had occurred. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/> <q>&#x0022;It's a bad night to trouble you to come so far, doctor,&#x0022;</q> he said, looking at me from under his fur cap; <q>&#x0022;but there is a bad accident happened over at our clearin, and if you kin do anything for the poor chap, I'll be glad to see it done, more particularly as I helped to shoot him.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/> <q>&#x0022;Helped to shoot him!&#x0022;</q> I said, with a start, <q>&#x0022;what do you mean?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/> <q>&#x0022;We took him for some kind of a critter, that's how it was,&#x0022;</q> answered my visitor; <q>&#x0022;not a purpose, stranger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>We think heaps of him I'd sooner hev shot myself. &#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/> I knew the man spoke the truth, and, taking my box of <rs n="surgical instruments" type="product">surgical instruments</rs> under my arm, followed him to the spot where his horse was tied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>Mine was already saddled; my little darkey knew well enough what the arrival portended, and had made him ready.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>We were off in a few moments. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/> Few words were spoken as we rode along through the darkness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>I asked whether the wounds were serious, and my companion replied--<q>&#x0022;I'm afeard they be, doctor.&#x0022;</q> I asked if the injured man were young or old, and he answered--<q>&#x0022;rising <num value="40">forty</num>;&#x0022;</q> and then, after a few words upon the badness of the road, we relapsed into silence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/> At last a glimmering light told that we had approached a dwelling, and with a short <q>&#x0022;we rethar, doctor,&#x0022;</q> my companion sprang from his saddle and entered the door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>I followed him. The room was feebly lit by flickering candles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>About a bed in the centre were grouped <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> men and a woman, large and broad shouldered as any of her masculine companions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>A child, too, lay crying in its cradle, but no <num value="1">one</num> seemed to notice him. They made way for my approach, and I saw a figure stretched upon the bed. It was that of a man with sinewy limbs and weather beaten face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>His shirt was unbuttoned and the breast and sleeves were soaked with blood. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/> <q>&#x0022;Tain't of no use, doctor,&#x0022;</q> he said, as I bent over him; <q>&#x0022;I'm a gone coon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/><rs type="role2">Doctor</rs>'s stuff ain't no account to me now.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/> I did not believe him. His face was not that of a dying man, and the wounds scarcely seemed dangerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/><q>&#x0022;These bullets are bad things to have in <num value="1">one</num>'s side,&#x0022;</q> I said, <q> &#x0022;but men have lived through more than that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>Cheer up!&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/> <q>&#x0022;I am't down-hearted, doctor,&#x0022;</q> answered the man. <q>&#x0022;I shan't leave no children, nor no wife to fret after me and suffer for want of my rifle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>I never hev been much afeared of death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>But I can tell you, all you can do's no use.--There's a sign that can't be mistook.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>The group about the bed glanced at each other, and the woman shook her head at me as though she would have said, <q>&#x0022;Never mind his words.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/> I did what I could for him. The bullets were extracted, the wounds bound up. He was weak, but not desperately so. I looked at him and smiled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/><q>&#x0022;How now?&#x0022;</q> said I.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/></p> 
<p> <q>&#x0022;Taint no use &mdash; the watch is stopping fast,&#x0022;</q> he answered. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>Then, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, I noticed that beside him on the bed lay a great old-fashioned <rs n="silver watch" type="product">silver watch</rs>, the case battered, the face discolored, and that it ticked with a strange dull sound, as though it were very old and feeble. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/> <q>&#x0022;The watch has been injured by the bullets, I suppose,&#x0022;</q> said I; <q> &#x0022;besides, all watches stop at times.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/> <q>&#x0022;Not this <num value="1">one</num>, stranger,&#x0022;</q> said the wounded man. <q>&#x0022;They've laughed about that watch a <num value="100">hundred</num> times; now they'll find my story's true, I reckon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>That watch and I will stop at the same minute.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>The woman at the bedside shook her head again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/><q>&#x0022;It's an old fancy o'yourn, <persName n="Barlow,,Mike,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00359" reg="default:Barlow,Mike,,,"><foreName>Mike</foreName> <surname>Barlow</surname></persName>, &#x0022;</q> she said; <q>&#x0022;you'll live to see the folly of it.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/> <q>&#x0022;So they talk,&#x0022;</q> said the man. &#x0022;Now listen, doctor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>You've come for to see me and done all you could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>I'll give you that watch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>Its money valley aren't much, but it'll do you service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>It was give to me by an old <rs n="Frenchman" type="propernoun">Frenchman</rs> out o' <persName n="Canady,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00360" reg="mostcommon:Canady,nomatch:0"><surname>Canady</surname></persName>, when he was layin' just as I am layin'. It had been his father's, and grandfather's, and his great-grandfather's before that; and this is what he told me about it, and this is what you'll find to be truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>That watch will tick slow and steady, reg'lar as the sun, as long as whoever it belongs to is well, and safe, and thriving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>When there's danger coming, it begins to go fast, faster, and faster and faster, until it is past, and so loud that you can hear it across the room as plain as if you held it in your hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>When death is coming that watch begins to stop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>It goes slower and slower.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>Its voice grows hollow, and, when the breath leaves the body, there's no more sound to be heard, and all you can do won't make it go for a year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>At the end of that time it will start all of a sudden, and after that time you can read your fate by it and know your death hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>It was so after old <persName><foreName>Pierre</foreName></persName> died.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>It will be so now. Keep the watch when I am gone, doctor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/> I could not help looking with some interest at the battered time-piece.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>A strange story had been woven about it, and the marvelons always had a charm for me. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/> I sat beside my patient until he sunk to sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>He seemed to be doing well still, and I had no doubt but that the morning light would see him greatly better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>But western hospitality would not permit of my departure at that late hour, and I was lodged in an upper chamber upon a bed as clean and simple as it was fragrant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>I slept soundly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>At <time value="12am">midnight</time>, however, I was awakened by the news that my patient was worse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>He had awakened in mortal agony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>Some inward injury, impossible to discover, had done its work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>I said nothing of hope now, and the dying man looked at me with a ghastly smile. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/> <q>&#x0022;Take the watch,&#x0022;</q> he said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/><q>&#x0022;Watch it and me; you will find me right. &#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>These were the last words he uttered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>He muttered incoherently after this, tossed his arms about, and struggled for his breath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>At last he seemed to sink into a slumber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>My hand was on his heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>I felt its beatings grow faint, fainter, fainter still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>At last there was no motion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>He was dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>I lifted the watch to my ear &mdash; that-had stopped also! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>There were tears in the eyes of the rough men about me, and the woman wept as she might for <num value="1">one</num> of her own kindred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>I could do no good now, and I turned away, leaving the watch upon the cover lid, but <num value="1">one</num> of the men same after me. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/> <q>&#x0022;He give it to you.&#x0022;</q> he said, <q>&#x0022;and it's your'n. <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> He had nobody belongin' to him, so you needn't be afeared to take it. He must have taken a likin' to you, for he thought a head of it. Take it, doctor.&#x0022;</q> And so the watch was mine. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/> It was dumb and motionless, and remained so. I took it to a watchmaker, and he laughed at the iden of its ever going again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>This was after I had left the <rs>West</rs> and dwelt in a large and populous city in the <rs>Eastern States</rs>, some <num value="8">eight</num> or <measure n="9months" type="date">nine months</measure> after poor <persName n="Barlow,,Mike,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00361" reg="default:Barlow,Mike,,,"><foreName>Mike</foreName> <surname>Barlow</surname></persName>'s death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>The watchmaker only confirmed my own suspicions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>It was a strange coincidence that it should last exactly his master's lifetime, but that was all. So I hung it upon my chamber wall, a memento of those days of toil and struggle in the far <rs>West</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/> <num value="1">One</num> morning I awoke early.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>The blushes of dawn were just breaking over the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>It was the month of <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct>, but still the day was lovely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>There was an unwonted sound in my room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>Had the sky been cloudy I should have imagined it to be the rain upon the roof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>Then I began to feel that this sound I heard was too delicate for the patter of rain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>It might have been the clang of a fairy hammer, or the tapping of the beak of some minute bird, save that it was too regular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>But the mystery of the sound was that it seemed to appeal to me &mdash; to reproach me with forgetting it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/> I sat up and looked about me. In an instant I understood the sound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>It was the tick of the old watch upon the wall Silent for a <num value="12">twelve</num>-mouth, it had suddenly found voice, as though some spirit hand had touched its springs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>I looked at my memorandum book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/><time value="12oclock">Twelve o'clock</time> of the past night was the anniversary of <persName n="Barlow,,Mike,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00362" reg="default:Barlow,Mike,,,"><foreName>Mike</foreName> <surname>Barlow</surname></persName>'s death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>His words had come true at last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>He had said that, when it once again began to move it would be as my monitor of safety or danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>All else bad happened as he had foretold; why should not this come to pass?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>I wore upon my guard chain a dainty little <placeName reg="Geneva, Ontario, New York" key="tgn,2069365">Geneva</placeName> watch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>I unfastened it, and put the battered silver monster in its place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>The budding development of the mystery made it more precious to me than if it had been set with jewels. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/> It did not stop again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>I heard the soft clear <q>&#x0022;tick, tick, tick,&#x0022;</q> all day and when I awakened in the might.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>Once or twice it beat more rapidly than usual, and always before peril &mdash; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time when a fever threatened me; the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> as I stood upon a broken bridge, which was swept away <num value="1">one</num> hour afterwards; and at other moments which I have forgotten, but which served to keep alive the fancy that I have loved to cherish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>Never was its voice so clear and soft as on that evening when I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> met <persName n="Grey,,Rosa,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00363" reg="default:Grey,Rosa,,,"><foreName>Rosa</foreName> <surname>Grey</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>I loved her from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> moment, and she loved me in return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>We had neither of us any friends to interfere, for she was an orphan, brotherless and sisterless; and so, after a brief courtship, we were married. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/> I had no secrets from my wife, and in a little while she learned the story of the watch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>She had faith in it, and thought or fancied that she could detect the very shades of difference in its utterance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>When I was weary she said the watch was weary, too; when I was glad, it had a joyous echo.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>I know that on that night when a feeble breath fluttered in a feebler frame, and the little creature to whom our love had given existence struggled vainly for its life, there was a piteous cadence in the voice of that old watch I hope never to hear again. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/> So we lived on together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>It was <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> will that we should be childless, but we loved each other all the more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>I grew rich and prosperous, and our only grief was the missing of those baby eyes and voices which we had hoped to have about our hearth. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/> It was my <num value="40" type="ordinal">fortieth</num> birthday &mdash; I never shall forget the day &mdash; when the watch began its warming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>My wife and I heard it at <num value="1">one</num> moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>Never before had the voice of that watch been so loud or rapid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>All day long, all the next, and all the next, that warning continued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>The strong pulse within the watch shook the table on which it rested when I drew it from my pocket, and made the garments on my bosom rise and fall when I replaced it.--Were we threatened with illness?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>No! her cheek was blooming and my pulse was regular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>What could it mean! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/> After <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure> I began to laugh at my own credulity, and even <persName n="Rosa,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00364" reg="mostcommon:Rosa,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosa</surname></persName> began to lose her faith in the monitor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>About noon I left her, and went along to a little room where I kept my medical works and some rare drugs and curiosities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>It was my purpose to study for a lecture which I was to deliver that evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>I seated myself at my desk and commenced to read; but after a few moments I began to experience a singular faintness, and to inhale a disagreeable odor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/>I recognized the smell in a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>In <num value="1">one</num> of the jars upon my shelves was a rare essence of great use in cases where a suspension of consciousness was necessary, but excessively dangerous save in skillful hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>Some <num value="1">one</num> (a servant probably) had been meddling with the jar, and removed the stopper, and the room was full of the powerful odor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>I must leave it, if I would <num value="5">five</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>I staggered to the door, put my hand upon the lock, when, horror of horrors!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>it remained immovable &mdash; something had happened to the catch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>I strove to call aloud, but my voice failed me. I clutched the table for support, but lost my hold and fell heavily to the floor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>I could see nothing; all grew dark about me. Mechanically I placed my hand upon the watch within my bosom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>It had stopped &mdash; and I remember nothing more. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/> Consciousness came back to me, as it may come to a new-born babe, for aught I know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>I felt without understanding; I was conscious of facts for which I cared nothing; I was in the dark; I was very cold, and my movements were constrained; but it did not seem as though that were any affair of mine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>Hunger at last awoke me; the animal aroused the mental, and I began to wander where I had been and where I was. I put up my hand as well as I could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>There was a low roof over my head, folds of muslin lay about me, and something was upon my breast which emitted a sickly fragrance &mdash; a bunch of flowers seeming half withered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/>I knew this by the touch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>What was the matter with me?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/>Why could I not breathe freely?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/>Was I blind and deaf, that I could neither see nor hear?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/>Suddenly truth flashed across me; I had been <hi rend="italics">buried alive!</hi>--I lay in my coffin! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/> And all this time you ask, where was my wife?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/>How had she borne the blow which had fallen so suddenly upon her?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>She it was who found me senseless upon my study floor; and she it was who hoped for returning consciousness after all others despaired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>At last they told her I was dead, and shrouded me for burial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>Learned men decided that the strange preservation of my frame was caused by the manner of death, and at length my body was committed to the tomb. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/> I had often made my wife promise me that if I died <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> she would take the watch into her own possession, and wear it while she lived; and so, now that all was over, she took it, voiceless as it was, and laid it next her bosom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>For <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> and nights she never slept; but at last exhaustion did its work, and she fell into a heavy slumber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>She was awaked by a sound as strange as it was unexpected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>The watch, silent since that fatal day, had begun to tick &mdash; fast and furious, as it never ticked before; loud enough to arouse her &mdash; loud enough to make her spring to her pillow in an agony of hope and fear. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/> Those about her thought she was a mad woman; but nevertheless the strength of her purpose bore all before her. Out into the midnight she went, and they followed.--Through the streets of the deserted town she passed in her white night robes like a ghost, and they dared not hold her back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>She reached the church yard at last, and beat wildly on the old sexton's door. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/> <q>&#x0022;I am come to tell you to open my husband's vault,&#x0022;</q> sile said; <q>&#x0022;he is come to life again.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/> He also thought her mad, and yet dared not disobey her, and all the while the furious ticking of the watch was heard by each <num value="1">one</num> there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/>It softened, it stilled, when the doors were opened and the black coffin stood upon the turf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>It grew musical when my wife bent over me and caught me to her heart &mdash; no corpse, but a living man, and it has had no change in its regular beat since that moment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/> It is before me now, battered and worn as it was when it <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> came into my possession; and you may laugh alike at the watch and at the superstition with which it is connected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>But my wife believes in it firmly, and loves it as though it were a living thing; and, for the matter of that, so do I.
