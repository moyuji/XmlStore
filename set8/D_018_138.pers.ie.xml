<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> I have had the honor to receive your note of the <num value="17" type="ordinal">17th</num>, and I now reply to the grave questions therein propounded as fully as the time allowed me will permit. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> Within their respective spheres of action the <rs>Federal Government</rs> and the <rs>Government</rs> of a State are both of them independent and supreme, but each is utterly powerless beyond the limits assigned to it by the <rs>Constitution</rs>.--If Congress would attempt to change the law of descents, to make a new rule of personal succession, or dissolve the family relations existing in any State, the act would be simply void, but not more void than would be a State law to prevent the recapture of fugitives from labor, to forbid the carrying of the mails, or to stop the collection of duties on imports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The will of a State, whether expressed in its Constitution or laws, cannot, while it remains in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, absolve her people from the duty of obeying the just and constitutional requirements of the <rs>Central Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Nor can any act of the <rs>Central Government</rs> displace the jurisdiction of a State, because the laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> are supreme and binding only so far as they are passed in <hi rend="italics">pursuance of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.</hi> I do not say what might be effected by mere <sic>revolutinary</sic> force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>I am speaking of legal and constitutional right. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> This is the view always taken by the <name>Judiciary</name>, and so universally adopted that the statement of it may seem common place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></orgName> has declared it in many cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>I need only refer you to the <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></hi> vs. <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Booth,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Booth,D.,F.,,:1"><surname>Booth</surname></persName>,</hi> where the present <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Justice">Chief Justice</rs>, expressing the unanimous opinion of himself and all his brethren, enunciated the doctrine in terms so clear and full that any further demonstration of it can scarcely be required. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> The duty which these principles devolve not only upon every officer, but every citizen, is that which <persName n="Jefferson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,Joseph,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName> expressed so compendiously in his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> inaugural, namely, <q>&#x0022;to support the <rs>State Governments</rs> in all their rights, as the most competent administrations for their domestic concerns, and the surest bulwarks against anti-<rs n="Republican" type="political">republican</rs> tendencies,&#x0022;</q> combined with <q>&#x0022;the preservation of the <rs>General Government</rs>, in its whole constitutional vigor, as the sheet-anchor of our peace at home and safety abroad.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> To the <rs>Chief Executive</rs> <rs type="role" reg="Magistrate">Magistrate</rs> of the <rs>Union</rs> is confided the solemn duty of seeing the laws faithfully executed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>That he may be able to meet this duty with a power equal to its performance, he nominates his own subordinates and removes them at his pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>For the same reason the land and naval forces are under his orders as their commander-in-chief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>But his power is to be used only in the manner prescribed by the legislative department.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>He cannot accomplish a legal purpose by illegal means, or break the laws himself to prevent them from being violated by others. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> The acts of Congress sometimes give the <rs>President</rs> a broad discretion in the use of the means by which they are to be executed, and sometimes limit his power so that he can exercise it only in a certain prescribed manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Where the law directs a thing to be done, without saying how, that implies the power to use such means as may be necessary and proper to accomplish the end of the <name>Legislature</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>But where the mode of performing a duty is pointed out by statute, that is the exclusive mode, and no other can be followed.--The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have no common law to fill back upon when the written law is defective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>If, therefore, an act of Congress declares that a certain thing shall be done by a particular officer, it cannot be done by a different officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The agency which the law furnishes for its own execution must be used, to the exclusion of all others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>For instance, the revenues of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> are to be collected in a certain way, at certain established ports, and by a certain class of officers; the <rs>President</rs> has no authority, under any circumstances, to collect the same revenues at other places, by a different sort of officers, or in ways not provided for. Even if the machinery furnished by Congress for the collection of the duties should by any cause become so deranged or broken up that it could not be used, that would not be a legal reason for substituting a different kind of machinery in its place. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> The law requires that all goods imported into the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> within certain collection districts shall be entered at the proper port, and the duty thereon shall be received by the <rs>Collector</rs> appointed for and residing at that port.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>But the functions of the <rs>Collector</rs> may be exercised anywhere at or within the port.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>There is no law which confines him to the custom- house, or to any other particular spot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>If the custom-house were burnt down, he might remove to another building; if he were driven from the shore, he might go on board a vessel in the harbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>If he keeps within the port he is within the law. A port is a place to which merchandize is imported, and from whence it is exported.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>It is created by law. It is not merely a harbor or haven, for it may be established where there is nothing but an open roadstead, or on the shore of a navigable river, or at any other place where vessels may arrive and discharge or take in their cargoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>It comprehends the city or town which is occupied by the mariners, merchants and others who are engaged in the business of importing and exporting goods, navigating the ships, and furnishing them with provisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>It includes also so much of the water adjacent to the city as is usually occupied by vessels discharging or receiving their cargoes, or lying at anchor and waiting for that purpose. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> The <orgName type="regiment" key="1Section">first section</orgName> of the act of <date value="1833-03-02">March 2, 1833,</date> authorized the <rs>President</rs> in a certain contingency to direct that the custom-house for any collection district be established and kept <hi rend="italics">in any secure place within some port or harbor of such district,</hi> either upon land or on board any vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>But this provision was temporary, and expired at the end of the session of Congress next afterwards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>It conferred upon the <rs>Executive</rs> a right to remove the site of the custom-house, not merely to any secure place within the legally established port of entry for the district &mdash; the right he had before &mdash; but it widened his authority so as to allow the removal of it to any <hi rend="italics">port or harbor</hi> within the whole district.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The enactment of that law and the limitation of it to a certain period of time now past, is not, therefore, an argument against the opinion above expressed that you can now, if necessary, order the duties to be collected on board a vessel inside of any established port of entry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Whether the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and <orgName type="regiment" key="5Section">fifth sections</orgName> of the act of <dateStruct value="1833--"><year reg="1833">1833</year></dateStruct>, both of which were made temporary by the <orgName type="regiment" key="8Section">eighth section</orgName>, should be re-enacted, is a question for the legislative department. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> Your right to take such measures as may seem to be necessary for the protection of the public property is very clear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Its results from the proprietary rights of the <rs>Government</rs> as owner of the forts, arsenals, magazines, dock-yards, navy-yards, custom-houses, public ships, and other property which the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have bought, built, and paid for. Besides, the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> is authorized by the <rs>Constitution</rs> (Art.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/><num value="1">1</num>, <rs type="role">Sec.</rs> <num value="8">8</num>) to <q>&#x0022;exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever &mdash; over all places purchased by the consent of the <orgName n="State Legislature" type="legislature">Legislature of the State</orgName> in which the same shall be for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals, dock-yards, and other needful buildings.&#x0022;</q> It is believed that no important public building has been bought or erected on ground where the <orgName n="State Legislature" type="legislature">Legislature of the State</orgName>, in which it is, has not passed a law consenting to the purchase of it and ceding the exclusive jurisdiction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>This Government, then, is not only the owner of those buildings and grounds, but, by virtue of the supreme and paramount law, it regulates the action and punishes the offences of all who are within them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>If any <num value="1">one</num> of an owner's rights is plainer than another, it is that of keeping exclusive possession and repelling intrusion.--The right of defending the public property includes also the right of recapture after it has been unlawfully taken by another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/><persName n="Jefferson,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,Joseph,,,:1"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName> held the opinion, and acted upon it, that he could order a military force to take possession of any land to which the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> had title, though they had never occupied it before, though a private party claimed and held it, and though it was not then needed nor proposed to be used for any purpose connected with the operations of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>This may have been a stretch of the <rs>Executive</rs> power; but the right of retaking public property in which the <rs>Government</rs> has been carrying on its lawful business, and from which its officers have been unlawfully thrust out, cannot well be doubted; and when it was exercised at <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1859-10-"><month reg="10">October</month>, <year reg="1859">1859</year></dateStruct>, every <num value="1">one</num> acknowledged the legal justice of it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/> I come now to the point in your letter which is probably of the greatest practical importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>By the act of <dateStruct value="1807--"><year reg="1807">1807</year></dateStruct> you may employ such <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> parts of the land and naval forces as you shall judge necessary for the purpose of causing the laws to be duly executed, in all cases where it is lawful to use the militia for the same purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>By the act of <dateStruct value="1795--"><year reg="1795">1795</year></dateStruct> the militia may be called forth <q>&#x0022;whenever the laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> shall be opposed or the execution thereof obstructed in any State by combinations too powerful to be suppressed by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, or by the power vested in the marshals.&#x0022;</q> This imposes upon the <rs>President</rs> the sole responsibility of deciding whether the exigency has arisen which requires the use of military force; and in proportion to the magnitude of that responsibility will be his care not to overstep the limits of his legal and just authority. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> The laws referred to in the act of <dateStruct value="1795--"><year reg="1795">1795</year></dateStruct> are manifestly those which are administered by the judges and executed by the ministerial officers of the courts for the punishment of crime against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, for the protection of rights claimed under the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs> and laws, and for the enforcement of such obligations as come within the cognizance of the <rs>Federal Judiciary</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>To compel obedience to these laws the courts have authority to punish all who obstruct their regular administration, and the marshals and their deputies have the same powers as sheriffs and their deputies in the several States in executing the laws of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>These are the ordinary means provided for the execution of the laws, and the whole spirit of our system is opposed to the employment of any other except in cases of extreme necessity, arising out of great and unusual combinations against them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Their agency must continue to be used until their incapacity to cope with the power opposed to them shall be plainly demonstrated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>It is only upon clear evidence to that effect that a military force can be called into the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Even then its operations must be purely defensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>It can suppress only such combinations as are found directly opposing the laws and obstructing the execution thereof.--It can do no more than what might and ought to be done by a civil posse, if a civil posse could be raised large enough to meet the same opposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>On such occasions especially, the military power must be kept in strict subordination to the civil authority, since it is only in aid of the latter that the former can act at all. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> But what if the feeling in any State against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> should become so universal that the <rs>Federal</rs> officers themselves (including judges, district attorneys, and marshals,) would be reached by the same influences and resign their places?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Of course the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> step would be to appoint others in their Stead, if others could be got to serve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>But, in such an event, it is more than probable that great difficulty would be found in filling the offices.--We can easily conceive how it might become altogether impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>We are, therefore, obliged to consider what can be done in case we have no courts to issue judicial process, and no ministerial officers to execute it. In that event troops would certainly be out of place, and their use wholly illegal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>If they are sent to aid the courts and marshals, there must be courts and marshals to be aided.--Without the exercise of those functions, which belong exclusively to the civil service, the laws cannot be executed in any event, no matter what may be the physical strength which the <rs>Government</rs> has at its command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Under such circumstances, to send a military force into any State with orders to act against the people would be simply making war upon them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/> The existing laws put and keep the <rs>Federal Government</rs> strictly on the defensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>You can use force only to repel an assault on the public property, and aid the courts in the performance of their duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>If the means given you to collect the revenue and execute the other laws be insufficient for that purpose, Congress may extend and make them more effectual to that end. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> If <num value="1">one</num> of the <name>States</name> should declare her independence, your action cannot depend upon the rightfulness of the cause upon which such declaration is based.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Whether the retirement of a State from the <rs>Union</rs> be the exercise of a right reserved in the <rs>Constitution</rs> or a revolutionary movement, it is certain that you have not in either case the authority to recognize her independence or to absolve her from her Federal obligations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Congress or the other States in convention assembled must take such measures as may be necessary and proper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>In such an event I see no course for you but to go straight on ward in the path you have hitherto trodden &mdash; that is, execute the laws to the extent of the defensive means placed in your hands, and act generally upon the assumption that the present constitutional relations between the <name>States</name> and the <rs>Federal Government</rs> continue to exist until a new order of things shall be established, either by law or force. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/> Whether Congress has the constitutional right to make war against <num value="1">one</num> or more States, and require the <rs>Executive</rs> of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> to carry it on by means of force to be drawn from the other States, is a question for Congress itself to consider.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>It must be admitted that no such power is expressly given; nor are there any words in the <rs>Constitution</rs> which imply it. Among the powers enumerated in article <num value="1">1</num>, <rs type="role">sec.</rs> <num value="8">8</num>, is that <q>&#x0022;to declare war, grant letters of marque and reprisal, and to make rules concerning captures on land and water.&#x0022; </q> This certainly means nothing more than the power to commence and carry on hostilities against the foreign enemies of the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Another clause in the same section gives Congress the power <q>&#x0022;to provide for calling forth the militia,&#x0022;</q> and to use them within the limits of the <rs>State</rs>.--But this power is so restricted by the words which immediately follow, that it can be exercised only for <num value="1">one</num> of the following purposes: <num value="1">1</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>To execute the laws of the <rs>Union</rs>; that is, to aid the <rs>Federal</rs> officers in the performance of their regular duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/><num value="2">2</num>. To suppress insurrection against the <name>States</name>; but this is confined by article <num value="4">4</num>, section <num value="4">4</num>, to cases in which the <rs>State</rs> herself shall apply for assistance against her own people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/><num value="3">3</num>. To repel the invasion of a State by enemies who come from abroad to assail her in her own territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>All these provisions are made to protect the <name>States</name>, not to authorize an attack by <num value="1">one</num> part of the country upon another; to preserve their peace, and not to plunge them into civil war. Our forefathers do not seem to have thought that war was calculated <q>&#x0022;to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.&#x0022;</q>S There was undoubtedly a strong and universal conviction among the men who framed and ratified the <rs>Constitution</rs> that military force would not only be useless but pernicious as a means of holding the <name>States</name> together. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/> If it be true that war cannot be declared, nor a system of general hostilities carried on by the <rs>Central Government</rs> against a State, then it seems to follow that an attempt to do so would be <hi rend="italics">ipso facto</hi> an expulsion of such State from the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Being treated as an allen and an enemy, she would be compelled to act accordingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>And if Congress shall break up the present Union by unconstitutionally putting strife and enmity and armed hostility between different sections of the country, instead of the &#x0022;domestic tranquility&#x0022; which the <rs>Constitution</rs> was meant to insure, will not all the <name>States</name> be absolved from their Federal obligations?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Is any portion of the people bound to contribute their money or their blood to carry on a contest like that? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/> The right of the <rs>General Government</rs> to preserve itself in its whole constitutional vigor, by repelling a direct and positive aggression upon its property or its officers, cannot be denied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>But this is a totally different thing from an offensive war to punish the people for the political misdeeds of their State Government, or to prevent a threatened violation of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, or to enforce an acknowledgment that the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> is supreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>The States are colleagues of <num value="1">one</num> another, and if some of them shall conquer the rest and hold them as subjugated provinces, it would totally destroy the whole theory upon which they are now connected. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/> If this view of the subject be as correct as I think it is, then the <rs>Union</rs> must utterly perish at the moment when Congress shall arm <num value="1">one</num> part of the people against another for any purpose beyond that of merely protecting the <rs>General Government</rs> in the exercise of its proper constitutional functions. </p> <closer> <salute>I am, very respectfully, yours, &#x0026;c.,</salute> <signed><persName n="Black,,J.,S.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="default:Black,J.,S.,,"><foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName>  <surname>Black</surname></persName>.</signed> To the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. </closer> </div4> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/> The plates are cast <measure n="14inches" type="distance">fourteen inches</measure> square, and are composed of hexagon or honey comb cells.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>According to the law of mathematics, this distribution of iron covers the largest area of surface with the least amount of metal, so that by theory this new pavement is the cheapest iron pavement that it is possible to make.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>The plates are bound to each other by a peculiar joint, by which every <num value="1">one</num> is knitted to and held firmly by all the others, so that a dislocation of any joint is rendered impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>In this way, it is found that when the street is covered, the pavement is an entire street of metal from curb to curb, and from <num value="1">one</num> end of the street to the other; and a weight resting upon <num value="1">one</num> plate is distributed over the others for many feet around, giving the pavement immense strength. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/> When the pavement is laid the cells are filled with gravel and all made level, and then the surface becomes as pleasant and sure-footed to a horse as a piece of turf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>The wheels of vehicles moving over this pavement have their bearing all the time on metal planes, so that it is, in fact, a universal railway track &mdash; every man that owns a dray, wagon or vehicle of any kind, possesses really a better track to drive on outside of the street railway tracks than in them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/> Fortunately, it is no difficult matter, so far at any rate as communities are concerned, to make this discrimination, and doubtless it is equally practicable to establish some mode of singling out the sound and national individuals of those communities from the corrupt and diseased members.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>She never had the smoke of fanaticism on her garments.--There is nothing provincial in her sentiments ideas or utterance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>The sober old <placeName reg="Amsterdam, Montgomery, New York" key="tgn,2067814">Amsterdam</placeName> blood of the early colony, and the strong Cavalier infusion of subsequent days, imparted to the New York character an admirable combination of the practical and the chivalric, of conservatism and courage, which still maintains its ascendancy in defiance of the insubordinate and demoralizing currents from other sections, which are represented by such journals as the <orgName n="New York Tribune" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi></orgName>, a <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> paper published in New York, and which is a stain upon a harmonious picture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>The commercial relations of New York have contributed to confirm the national, liberal tone, for which the city was distinguished in the beginning, and she has never failed at the ballot-box to let her voice be heard in tones of thunder, on the side of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the laws, whenever the emergency demanded her powerful interposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>The most powerful argument we ever heard upon that subject was from the lips of a native of New York in the midst of a Western crowd of &#x0022;Sons of the <name>Pilgrims</name>,&#x0022; who, if they &#x0022;came to scoff, remained to pray, &#x0022; and were, at least for the time, convinced, and converted from the error of their ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>Physically, intellectually, and morally, New York is as powerful in the <rs>North</rs> as she is patriotic and conservative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>The bone and muscle, the brains, the public spirit, the capital and enterprise of the <rs>State</rs>, are concentrated on <placeName reg="Manhattan Island, New York, Kings" key="tgn,7022657">Manhattan Island</placeName>, which is the head of this New York comet, the rest of the <rs>State</rs> being merely a gaseous, luminous tail, which is only formidable in its fiery aspect and huge proportions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>We trust that the day may never come when the <placeName type="city" key="tgn,7007567">city of New York</placeName> will succumb to the <name>Puritanic</name> influences which have abolitionized so large a portion of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>As long as she is national in spirit she will be national in wealth and power.--We have an abiding confidence that she cannot be cheated or cajoled out of her ancient principles and her true policy, by the subtle and deadly counsels of those imported orators, politicians and preachers from the <rs>East</rs>, who, bitterly as they hate the <rs>South</rs>, are not half as dangerous enemies of Southern Institutions as they are of their own interests and firesides.

<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1698"/> --The morbid nervousness of the present day appears in several ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1699"/>It brings a man sometimes to that startled state, that the sudden opening of a door, the clash of the falling <rs n="fire irons" type="product">fire-irons</rs>, or any little accident, puts him in a flutter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1700"/>How nervous the late <persName n="Peel,Sir,Robert,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00903" reg="default:Peel,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Robert</foreName> <surname>Peel</surname></persName> must have been when, a few weeks before his death, he went to the <rs>Zoological Gardens</rs>, and when a monkey suddenly sprang upon his arm, the great and worthy man fainted!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1701"/>Another phase of nervousness is, when a man is brought to that state that the least noise or cross-occurrence seems to jar through the entire nervous system &mdash; to upset him, as we say, when he cannot command his mental powers, except in perfect stillness, or in the chamber and at the writing table to which he is accustomed; when, in short, he gets fidgety, easily worried, full of whims and fancies, which must be indulged and considered, or he is quite out of sorts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1702"/>Another phase of the same morbid condition is, when a human being is oppressed with vague undefined fears that things are going wrong, that his income will not meet the demands upon it, that his child's lungs are affected, that his mental powers are leaving him &mdash; a state of feeling which shades rapidly off into positive insanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1703"/>Indeed when matters remaining long in any of the fashions which have been described, I suppose the natural termination must be disease of the heart, or a shock of paralysis, or insanity in the form either of mania or idiocy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1704"/>Numbers of common-place people who could feel very acutely, but who could not tell what they felt, have been worried into fatal heart disease by prolonged anxiety and misery.--Every <num value="1">one</num> knows how paralysis laid its hand upon <persName n="Scott,Sir,Walter,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00904" reg="default:Scott,Walter,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Walter</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>, always great, lastly heroic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1705"/>Protracted anxiety how to make the ends meet, with a large family and an uncertain income, drove <persName n="Southey,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00905" reg="mostcommon:Southey,nomatch:0"><surname>Southey</surname></persName>'s <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> wife into the lunatic asylum; and there is hardly a more touching story than that of her fears and forebodings through nervous year after year.
