<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> Without presuming to intrude into the province of the clergy, we may conceive it possible that some of them will, tomorrow, give us a text from the book of <persName><foreName>Job</foreName></persName>. It is not the only book in the inspired record, by any means, that is suitable to that occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>It is impossible, indeed, to open a book or a chapter of the sacred volume that does not teach a lesson of submission and fortitude, and &#x0022;vindicate the ways of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> to man.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> A very learned man says: &#x0022;He hath observed, in the histories of all ages, that the great events which determine the fate of great affairs do happen less frequently, according to (human) design, than by (what are called) accident and occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Our enterprises here below are derived from above; and we are but engines and actors of pieces that are composed in Heaven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/><foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">Homo histrio, Deus vero p&#x00E6;ta est;</hi></foreign> &#x0027;<name n="God" type="God">God</name> is the sovereign poet&#x0027;; and we cannot refuse the part which he appoints us to bear in the scene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>All our business is to act it well; cheerfully complying with His orders concerning us, and submitting ourselves to the direction of His <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> It is a tradition of the <rs n="Jewish" type="religion">Jews</rs> that when <persName n="Moses,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Moses,nomatch:0"><surname>Moses</surname></persName> was sent by <name n="God" type="God">God</name> into <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, and beheld the grievous affliction of his people under <persName><foreName>Pharaoh</foreName></persName>, he took the pains to trans late the book of <persName><foreName>Job</foreName></persName> into their language out of the <name>Syriac</name>, wherein it was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> written, to comfort them in their lamentable condition. &#x0022;Be ye constant, oh children of <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName>,&#x0022; said <persName n="Moses,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Moses,nomatch:0"><surname>Moses</surname></persName>, &#x0022;do not faint in your minds, but suffer grief, and bear these evils patiently, as did that man whose name was <persName><foreName>Job</foreName></persName>; who, though he was a righteous and faithful person, yet suffered the sorest torment by the malice of the <name>Devil</name>; as you do now most unjustly from <persName><foreName>Pharaoh</foreName></persName> and the <name>Egyptians</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Do not despair of a better condition; you shall be delivered as <persName><foreName>Job</foreName></persName> was, and have a reward of your tribulations, like that which <name n="God" type="God">God</name> gave to him.&#x0022; To which it is added by a Christian writer, that the early <orgName n="Christian Church" type="church">Christian Church</orgName> was wont to read the book of <persName><foreName>Job</foreName></persName> upon fasting days and days, of abstinence, and of the days commemorative of our Saviour's sufferings, of which they thought they saw a figure in the sufferings of <persName><foreName>Job</foreName></persName>; as of our Saviour's resurrection and exaltation, in <persName><foreName>Job</foreName></persName>'s wonderful recovery and advancement to a greater height of prosperity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The same writer adds: &#x0022;But the principal benefit which I hope the afflicted will reap by this book is, to be persuaded thereby that all things are ordered and disposed by Almighty <name n="God" type="God">God</name>; without whose command or permission, neither good angels, nor the <name>Devil</name>, nor men, nor any other creature, can do anything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>And that as His power is infinite, so is His wisdom and goodness; which is able to bring good out of evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>And therefore we ought not to complain of Him in any condition, as if He neglected us, or dealt hardly with us; but rather cheerfully submit ourselves to His blessed will; which never doeth anything without reason, though we cannot always comprehend it. To that issue <name n="God" type="God">God</name> himself at last brings all the disputes between <persName><foreName>Job</foreName></persName> and his friends; representing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>His works throughout the world to be so wonderful and unaccountable that it is fit for us to acknowledge our ignorance, but never accuse His providence; if we cannot see the cause why He sends affliction, or continues it long upon us; instead of murmuring or complaining, in such a case, this book effectually teaches us to resign ourselves absolutely to Him; silently to adore and reverence the unsearchable depth of His wise counsels; contentedly to bear what He inflicts upon us; still to assert His <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> righteousness, in the midst of the calamities which befall the good, and in the most prosperous successes of the wicked; and steadfastly to believe that all, at last, shall turn to our advantage, if, like His servant <persName><foreName>Job</foreName></persName>, we persevere in faith and hope and patience.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> The condition of <persName><foreName>Job</foreName></persName> in his prosperity was not unlike that of many large planters and farmers of the <rs>South</rs> in better days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>He was rich in land and cattle, and had large numbers of slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The most unlimited plenty and hospitality reigned in his dwelling and the dwellings of his family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The birthdays of his children were celebrated with innocent feasting and merriment, as well as accompanied by prayer and sacrifice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>It was upon such a man as this &mdash; devout, generous, genial, illustrious for virtue as for wealth &mdash; that the <name>Devil</name> was permitted to turn loose fire, sword, hurricane, disease; to strip him of children, servants, prosperity and health; to make him an object of scorn to his own friends, and to reduce him so low in the regards of men that he exclaimed: &#x0022;They that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to set with the dogs of my flock.&#x0022; &#x0022;And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.&#x0022; How many a Southern patriarch, exiled from his home, and bereft of his possessions, can look back with <persName><foreName>Job</foreName></persName>, and say: &#x0022;Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when <name n="God" type="God">God</name> preserved me,&#x0022; &#x0022;when the <name>Almighty</name> was yet with me, when my children were about me, when I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil.&#x0022; Yet, amidst all his reverses and humiliations, <persName><foreName>Job</foreName></persName> did not deny the <rs>Providence</rs> of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>; he bore his disasters with resolution, with resignation, and even with hearty thanksgiving. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> If such a man could be permitted thus to suffer, and could conclude that the best of men are but vile in the sight of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, we of this generation can scarcely present any superior claims to the indulgence of Heaven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The purest and noblest of our people, who have been reduced from <sic>alllorence</sic> to poverty, and are mourning over better days, may well exclaim: &#x0022;What, shall we receive good at the hands of the <rs>Lord</rs>, and shall we not suffer evil? &#x0022; and heed the counsel of St. Basil: &#x0022;Remember all the past happiness thou hast enjoyed, and oppose better unto worse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>No man's life is entirely and thoroughly happy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>If thou art grieved at what is present, fetch thy comfort from what thou hast received before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Now thou weepest, but formerly thou didst laugh; now thou art poor, but there was a time when thou wanted nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Then thou drankest of the pure fountain of life; be content and drink now more patiently of the troubled waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Behold the rivers, their streams are not clear in all places; and our life, thou knowest, is like to <num value="1">one</num> of them, which slides away continually, and is ofttimes full of waves, which come rolling <num value="1">one</num> upon another: <num value="1">one</num> part of this river is passed by, and another is running on its course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>This part of it is gushing out from the fountain, and the next is ready to follow as soon as it is gone.--And thus we are all making great haste to the common sea; Death, I mean, which swallows up all at last.&#x0022; </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The judgment <rs>Europe</rs> has passed on them has been materially influenced by the system of government they authorized or permitted in this portion of their dominions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>It identified the <rs>Russian</rs> power and the <rs>Russian</rs> name with the worst kind of despotism, and made it a kind of terror to the nations of the <rs>West</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>Report said that this tobacco was to be traded with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> for bacon, and that <persName n="Singleton,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00113" reg="mostcommon:Singleton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Singleton</surname></persName> was the prime mover in the arrangement, this being the business that brought him again to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 7" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>It was transported to <placeName reg="Hamilton, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2112085">Hamilton</placeName>'s crossing by rail, and thence hauled to <placeName><placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, <distance reg="5miles">five miles distant</distance></placeName>, in wagons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>It is ascertained that they burned the wagons (<num value="5">five</num> in number) employed in hauling the tobacco from <placeName reg="Hamilton, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2112085">Hamilton</placeName>'s to <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, and carried off the teams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>So ends <num value="1">one</num> of the most brilliant schemes of our latter-day speculators.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>The only thing to be seriously regretted about the business is the loss by the <orgName n="Fredericksburg Railroad" type="railroad">Fredericksburg Railroad</orgName> Company of the <num value="31">thirty- one</num> valuable freight cars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>As these masses settled into comparative order, and the mass of people on the parade below had also become still, the <rs>President</rs> was seen in the centre of the central group, with <persName n="Chase,Chief-Justice,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00261" reg="mostcommon:Chase,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Chief-Justice">Chief Justice</roleName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName> and some of the other <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Justice">Chief Justices</rs>, in their gowns, seated on his left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>As the <rs>President</rs> came forward, there was a cheer, but not a great <num value="1">one</num>, and at the same time the sun burst through the clouds, and, though pretty well to the south, lighted up the whole east face very brilliantly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>The <hi rend="italics">coup <unclear></unclear></hi> at that moment was magnificent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/> At about <time value="1oclock">1 o'clock</time>, the bands being at last hushed, the <rs>President</rs> rose and stepped forward to the reading desk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>He was greeted with faint applause; indeed, there was no enthusiasm throughout the address.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>It was not strictly an inaugural address, since it was read before <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00262" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> took the oath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>It was more like a valedictory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> read in a very loud, clear voice, and hundreds of the audience could hear it. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/> During the delivery of the speech, <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00263" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,E.,M.,,"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName> and <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00264" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> were remarkably attentive, rising and bending forward to listen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>The crowd kept pushing nearer and nearer the platform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>Beyond this there was no cheering of any consequence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>Even the soldiers did not hurrah much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>The statement that &#x0022;the progress of our arms is, I trust, reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all, &#x0022; met with no response, although the <rs>President</rs> paused significantly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>The declaration that we accepted the war rather than let the nation perish drew the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> cheer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>The remark that slavery would cease with the war was applauded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>The satirical observation that men asked <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> assistance in wringing bread from other men's faces caused <num value="0.5">a half</num> laugh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>These were the only marks of approbation until the close of the address. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/> After a brief pause, the <rs>President</rs> and <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Justice">Chief Justice</rs> rose together, and the oath of office was administered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>The voice of the <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Justice">Chief Justice</rs> was inaudible, but the workings of his countenance could be distinctly seen as he labored to be impressive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>Then there was a cheer, and the <rs>President</rs> came forward and bowed and smiled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>During the whole ceremony he looked unusually handsome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>When delivering his speech, his face glowed with enthusiasm, and he evidently felt every word that he uttered. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/> Cries for <persName n="Johnson,,Andy,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00267" reg="default:Johnson,Andy,,,"><foreName>Andy</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName> next ensued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>There was a momentary delay, and then the <rs type="role" reg="Vice-President">Vice-President</rs> presented himself and waved both hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>There were calls of &#x0022;Speech,&#x0022; &#x0022;Speech,&#x0022; and some applause when <persName><foreName>Andy</foreName></persName> appeared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>He rubbed his red face with his hands, as if to clear up his ideas, but did not succeed, and said nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>A lane was then opened through the crowd on the platform, and the <name>Presidential</name> party retired into the <rs>Capitol</rs>, amid the thunders of the artillery in <name>Capitol</name> square and the music of the bands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>The firing of the salute began the moment the <rs>President</rs> had taken the oath, and before the salute was over the assemblage began to disperse. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>He bowed very cordially to <persName n="Sumner,Senator,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00273" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName>, who returned the nod somewhat coldly; and much to the disappointment of those who witnessed the scene, did not rush frantically forward to his embrace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>He met with no better success in that quarter.
