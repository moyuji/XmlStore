<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/> Something of the position of the <rs>Federal</rs> army has been ascertained &mdash; enough, at least, to convince every <num value="1">one</num> that the late movement from the trenches was not made with a view of retreating, and, perhaps, sufficient to warrant reasonable conclusions as to what are <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00042" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s purposes, and where he will next strike. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/> The observations of our scouts, and reports from citizens in the rear of the late Federal lines, inform us that for some days back the enemy has been preparing a line of works, commencing on this side of the <rs>Chattahoochee</rs> a short distance above the railroad bridge, on the <rs>State</rs> road, and running down the river about <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> to a ferry, where they have built a permanent bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>From thence the works run to a point at the left of their extreme <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/> Behind those works the forces withdrawn so quietly on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> were thrown, and during Friday and <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> the centre was moved to the rear of this line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>The works are said to be formidable, particularly in front of the railroad bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>This position leaves the <rs>Federal</rs> line at least <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> shorter than it was before, and of course they have men to operate with elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>At the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> ferry below the railroad bridge their pontoon has also been taken up and a permanent bridge erected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>The pontoon will, it is expected, be moved to ferries lower down the river. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/> These preparations, and the position into which <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00043" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> has thrown his army, indicate very clearly that all his late unexpected movements are the result of his having arrived at the conclusion that he could not capture <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> by attacking its defences, and a matured plan for another attempt to flank our army from the city by cutting its railroad communication to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>The raiding policy was a failure, but the purpose might be accomplished by throwing his main line across the <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> and <placeName reg="Macon, Bibb, Georgia" key="tgn,7013980">Macon</placeName> roads, and that this is the grand movement that will be attempted there can be no longer any doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>The topography of the country on the north side of the river is said to be favorable for transportation by wagon, the roads numerous; and with the ferries bridged, as stated, supplies can be moved from <persName n="Vining,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00044" reg="mostcommon:Vining,nomatch:0"><surname>Vining</surname></persName>'s station above the river with facility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>Of the result, if his resources are sufficient, fears are entertained by but few. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>We also had rumors that skirmishing was going on during the day. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>They were, it was <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> thought, moving for Rough and Ready.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>Counter movements are, of course, going on, but of their character I may not speak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>Of the progress made by the enemy in this direction, nothing definite has been ascertained; in fact, the only information I have been able to obtain was from passengers by the <rs>Macon</rs> train just arrived, who bring reports current at Rough and Ready when the train passed, that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had reached a point <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> west of the station, and were busy digging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>No firing was heard as the train passed up the road to-day. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/> The platform adopted by the so-called Democracy is an admirable attempt at &#x0022;how not to do it.&#x0022; It contains not a single expression of opinion upon any question of public policy, except that in a mild and inoffensive manner it takes sides in favor of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>This is the purport of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> resolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> declares that after <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> of failure to restore the <rs>Union</rs> by war, efforts should be made for a cessation of hostilities with a view to calling a convention of all the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>But suppose the rebels refuse to go into a convention, or, going in, suppose they refuse peace except on terms of final separation?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>What then?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>The platform is entirely silent on this point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>It neither indicates the terms which should be offered the rebels nor informs the country whether the war should be resumed in the event of the refusal of the rebels to come back into the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/> * * This forcible, feeble manifesto from <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName> is more remarkable for what it omits than for what it embraces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>It contains not <num value="1">one</num> sentiment of approbation or censure upon the financial policy of the <name>Administration</name> during the last <measure n="3.5years" type="date">three and a half years</measure>. It neither condemns nor approves the legislation of Congress upon the subjects of tariff duties, internal revenue laws, bank-note currency, and the national banking system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>It is silent even upon emancipation, confiscation and conscription.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>What are we to infer from this silence?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>Must we not assume that the <rs>Convention</rs> approves these measures; that it regards them as settled, and no longer open questions?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>Of course we must; and if during the campaign any champion of the <rs>Chicago</rs> nominees shall arraign the party in power on any of these issues, it will be a sufficient answer to refer him to his platform for proof that they are no longer in controversy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/> The platform is also remarkable for its entire freedom from all malice and uncharitableness towards traitors and rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>Not a word of censure for secession in theory or rebellion in practice is permitted to find place in the platform; and all the indignation is directed at the efforts of the <name>Administration</name> to suppress the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>In a word, the veriest rebel may read the platform without taking offence, while no truly loyal man can fail to be disgusted with its manifest truckling to the disloyal elements in the loyal States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/> Out of a mass of correspondence dated from <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>, the <dateStruct value="--24"><day reg="24">24th ultimo</day></dateStruct>, we make up the following account of the position of affairs around there before <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00377" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s change of position, officially announced by <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00378" reg="nearbymention:Hood,J.,B.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName>: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/> The great effort of the <rs>Federal</rs> commander, during the last <measure n="4weeks" type="date">four weeks</measure>, has been to so extend his main lines as to cornpel an evacuation of the position here, without a battle, to capture the defences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>In his movements thus far, tending to this end, he has been thrice defeated--<num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> on his left, on the <dateStruct value="--22"><day reg="22">22d ultimo</day></dateStruct>; and on his right on the <dateStruct value="--28"><day reg="28">28th ultimo</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="--6"><day reg="6">6th instant</day></dateStruct>, respectively.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>Since the last-mentioned affair he has been stationary, so far as any efforts to extend his lines are concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>He has had heavy losses, and his original army has undoubtedly decreased <num value="0.33">thirty-three per cent.</num> Since the commencement of the campaign at <placeName reg="Dalton, Whitfield, Georgia" key="tgn,2022620">Dalton</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>This is the estimate of those who ought to be posted, if their scouts are worth anything; and they also profess to have certain information that no considerable reinforcements have reached <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00379" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>If these opinions be correct, then we may rationally account for the apparent listlessness manifested by the foe for nearly <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> past in our front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>The solution indulged in here is, that he has not men enough to hold his lines, which are about <measure n="12miles" type="distance">twelve miles</measure> long, and at the same time inaugurate any flank movement of strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>He is compelled to lie still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>He cannot take our works by a direct assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>That he is as well aware of as our men are confident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>Consequently, he must be waiting either for reinforcements, or else is depending upon the success of his raiding brigands upon the rear communications of <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00380" reg="nearbymention:Hood,J.,B.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>Can he get reinforcements?--Will <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00381" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> allow them to be sent to <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> so long as they may be needed to prevent his failure in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>It is not probable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>The impression, then, is that <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00382" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> must depend upon his cavalry; and to circumvent them, every energy is being directed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>The arrangements to protect the <placeName reg="Macon, Bibb, Georgia" key="tgn,7013980">Macon</placeName> road are such that I think no force the enemy can raise will be able to remain on it long enough to do any great damage, and but little fear is felt that the position here can be affected even should they reach the road, as they may occasionally do. They will be driven off at any time before they can injure the road so that it cannot be repaired in a very short time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/> Last night and to-day the fire upon the city has been very heavy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>Within the <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure> we have had <num value="3">three</num> distinct fires--<num value="1">one</num>, last night, a dwelling north of the <rs type="place">State Road</rs> workshops; another, a large warehouse between <address><street n="Pryor street">Pryor</street></address> and <address><street n="Whitehall street">Whitehall streets</street></address>, near the old <orgName n="Gate City" type="newspaper">Gate City</orgName> Hotel; and <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num>, this afternoon, by which the <rs n="lard oil" type="product">lard oil</rs> factory and <num value="3">three</num> dwellings on the north side of <address><street n="Alabama street">Alabama street</street></address> were destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>About <measure n="500barrels" type="mass">five hundred bales</measure> of cotton were stored in the warehouse, all of which was lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>The accuracy of the enemy's fire was demonstrated on the occasion of each of these fires, as they afforded a mark that was promptly opened upon, and struck almost every time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>The <orgName n="Post Office" type="office">post-office</orgName>, depot buildings and car shed were hit several times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>The only casualties I can hear of occurred in the <rs type="place">Macon depot</rs>, where <num value="5">five</num> of the post commissary hands were wounded by the explosion of a shell. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/> The weather continues pleasant, and the general health of the army is excellent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/> Information has been received through authentic channels of the concentration of a force of <num value="8000">eight thousand</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> cavalry near <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Summerville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>The impression has been given out by the leaders of the gang to citizens that they purpose operating, along the <placeName key="tgn,7007248" n="1.000 5" reg="georgia">Georgia</placeName> road, farther in the direction of <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName> than they have yet penetrated the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>This giving out is, however, regarded as a subterfuge.--They know that this road is as effectually lost to <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00383" reg="nearbymention:Hood,J.,B.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName> now as if every rail was torn up, and their efforts will be directed elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>They may strike for the <placeName reg="Macon, Bibb, Georgia" key="tgn,7013980">Macon</placeName> road, but the general impression is that they will endeavor to reach the <rs>Central</rs> road again, to interfere with the transportation of ammunition, etc., and then the <rs>Southwestern</rs>, so as to prevent the transportation of troops, should they think best to make an effort to capture the <rs type="place">Andersonville prison</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>This force has <num value="9">nine</num> pieces of artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>Scouts that came in last night expected them to move to-day; and if they have done so, we shall soon have knowledge of their whereabouts. </p> </div3>
