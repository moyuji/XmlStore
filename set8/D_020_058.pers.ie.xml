<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> --It has long been admitted as a maxim which cannot be dissipated, that of all enemies, the bitterest is a renegade to the cause he has deserted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>About <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> ago there was no Secessionist in the country so strong as <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Bennett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Bennett,nomatch:0"><surname>Bennett</surname></persName>,</hi> of the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>His paper overflowed with gall and bitterness towards <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:3"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName></hi> and the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>He wrote innumerable articles to prove that the <rs>South</rs> was altogether in the right &mdash; that the <rs>South</rs> was too powerful for the <rs>North</rs>--that the children of the <rs>South</rs> were of a character too martial for the <rs>North</rs> to hope for success in a contest between the <num value="2">two</num> sections &mdash; that the <rs>South</rs>, in such a contest, would be able to bring out its entire strength, from the circumstance of its having at home a body of tillers who were fit for nothing else but to till the soil, whereas the <rs>North</rs> could not subtract more than a certain portion of its population from agriculture &mdash; that the <rs>South</rs> held in its hands the great maple which commanded the commerce of the world, and which it was impossible to substitute from any quarter &mdash; that the <rs>South</rs> had no cause to dread the rivalry of <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName>, as the <orgName n="New York Times" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> had foolishly asserted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>There were no statesmen like the <rs>Southern</rs> statesmen &mdash; there was no wisdom like the wisdom of the <rs>Southern Government</rs>.--We were never among the number of those who placed any confidence in the affected zeal of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Bennett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Bennett,nomatch:0"><surname>Bennett</surname></persName></hi> for the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>We distrust Northern men with Southern principles wherever we hear of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>But we do not conceive them to be so bad as foreign renegades with no principle at all. We could not see how it could be possible that anything good could proceed from so vile a source, or how a man who had made money out of the stripes inflicted upon his own person, and who had notoriously connived at the dishonor of his own family, could be trusted in any circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The result has proved that our distrust was justly founded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>A mob threatened the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> office with destruction; the tone of the paper was instantly changed; from the warmest of friends it became instantly the bitterest of enemies, and <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Bennett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Bennett,nomatch:0"><surname>Bennett</surname></persName></hi> never had the grace to assign a single reason for the change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Of all the base flattery of which old <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><foreName>Abe</foreName></persName></hi> has been the recipient, there is none so base as that which flows from the columns of the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Like the <name>Spaniard</name> who admired the atrocities of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><foreName>Ferdinand</foreName></persName> </hi> <num value="7">VII</num> on account of their extreme wickedness, he cries out, in an ecstasy of delight, <q>&#x0022;he is all <persName n="King,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:King,nomatch:0"><surname>King</surname></persName>&#x0022;</q> whenever that Baboon perpetrates any new enormity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>His soul is the soul of a slave, who kisses the hand that is lifted to scourge him. He eats the words he uttered <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> ago every day of his life, and he seems to delight in the meal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>He is in favor of suppressing all the journals in New York <unclear>t</unclear> think and speak as he thought and spoke before his sudden conversion by the mob. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/> --For <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> at least our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> on the <rs>Potomac</rs> have offered battle to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>They have done more; they have made the tender with every circumstance of insult and provocation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>They have taken possession of eminences commanding the enemy's fortifications, and they have flirted the flag of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> in full view of the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName> and the <rs>Capitol</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>They have done all this with impunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>The enemy has exhibited no symptom of resentment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>He has meekly pocketed the insult and refused the challenge. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/> The whole country was on tip-toe of expectation a week ago for a great battle; but the bauble has not been fought; for the enemy has acted on that prudent maxim--<q>&#x0022;discretion is the better part of valor.&#x0022;</q> He lies close within his entrenchments, and listens with complacency, if not with satisfaction, to the music of our bands playing the provoking air of <q>&#x0022;Dixie.&#x0022;</q> The power that proposes to invade and subjugate the <rs>South</rs> submits to be beleaguered in its own capital; and while boasting its ability not only to carry its designs upon the <rs>South</rs> with execution, but to punish any interference in the quarrel on the part of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, is unable to ball down the <q>&#x0022;rebel&#x0022;</q> flag insultingly planted under the nose of its <rs type="role2">President</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/> Boasting a thoroughly organized army of a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> men around the seat of Government, and proclaiming that the <rs>Southern</rs> forces are starved, sick, discontented, and contemptible in number, it has not the courage to accept their challenge to battle, to strike for its honor, or to punish a most glaring piece of insolence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/> The acceptance of our challenge to battle would seem to be called for not less by a due sense of pride than by the necessities of the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>By the moving forward of our lines to points so near their own, and by the occupation by our right flank of the bank of the <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Potomac</placeName> of the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName>, in force, we blockade that river, and prevent all further access to the <rs>Capital</rs> by water; we thus confine them to <num value="1">one</num> single railroad in conducting all their communications with the <rs>Northern States</rs>, and render <num value="1">one</num> of their largest and most important navy-yards entirely useless for any purposes of the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/> Surely the use of so magnificent a sheet of water as the <rs>Potomac</rs>, and the utilizing of so valuable a navy-yard as that of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, is worthy of a battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>Their papers for nearly <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> have teemed with praises of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00102" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>,</hi> and with bints of his admirable preparations for another <q>&#x0022;onward movement.&#x0022;</q> Our own <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> have come out from amongst those treacherous <q>&#x0022;masked batteries&#x0022;</q> which are supposed to have cost the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> the disaster at <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>, and now stand in the open field ready to fight on terms the equality of which cannot be disputed; yet, with all their heralded preparations for great achievement, and all these inducements to fight, they crouch within their entrenchments, permitting us to have our own way outside of them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/> There can be but <num value="1">one</num> explanation of their conduct, and that is, that they neither dare nor are prepared to offer us battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>The soul of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> is cowered, and his <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> are afraid to trust him further outside of breast works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>All that preparation can do has been done for the defence of <orgName n="Washington Artillery" type="artillery">Washington. Artillery</orgName> of the most formidable efficiency and in the most formidable supply has been provided arms, ammunition, all the appliances of battle, have been brought into the most prodigal requisition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>But there is <num value="1">one</num> great trouble which cannot be overcome: their soldiers are cowards, and cannot be trusted in the open field The doughty <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00103" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName></hi> does not do what the unlucky <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="McDowell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00104" reg="mostcommon:McDowell,nomatch:0"><surname>McDowell</surname></persName></hi> did venture to do. Far from marching <measure n="25miles" type="distance">twenty-five miles</measure> to attack, he is afraid to accept battle offered in the immediate front of his fortifications. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/> And yet, defied thus at its own door, refusing battle insultingly thrust at them, cut off from its water communications with its own section, the wretched Government at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> affects to deny that the <rs>South</rs> is a belligerent power, and refuses to exchange prisoners lest the fact should carry this acknowledgment &mdash; What will the world think of the <rs>South</rs>'s claim to belligerency when it sees our armies thus insulting the timid officials at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>? </p> </div3>

<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/> --Whilst it gives us pleasure to learn that some of our hospitals exhibit thorough system and efficiency, and that kind and gentle attention to the sick which is as necessary as medicine to their restoration to health, we are sorry to hear that there are others in which the private soldiers are not treated by the attendants with much tenderness and consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>This is a subject which demands immediate and thorough investigation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>Such investigation no well conducted hospital has reason to fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>It is due to the cause and it is due to the gallant men who support it. The army of the <rs>South</rs> is not made up of mercenaries, and, if it were, the mercenary, from policy, if not from humanity, deserves to be nursed when sick in such a manner as will most speedily place him again in a condition to bear arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>But there is not a man in our Southern army who came there for pay; not <num value="1">one</num> who was compelled to come; not <num value="1">one</num> who has any other motive but a love of country as pure and disinterested as ever animated the soul of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Washington,,George,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00105" reg="default:Washington,George,,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName>.</hi> The rank and file of our army embrace the noblest spirits in this or any other land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>They are gentlemen, many of them men of delicate rearing, wealth and social position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>They had none of them even the incentive of office and fame to inspire them to their duty.--They have given up home, loved ones, and are willing to give up life itself, for their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>For their own sake, for the sake of the aged parents who have laid them upon the altar of patriotism, for the sake of the country and of humanity, an investigation should be made, which shall probe this whole subject to the bottom, and insure the sick of the rank and file against the possibility of neglect and harsh treatment. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>The city to-day has been filled with the excitement of deferred expectation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>At sunset last evening the impression was general that this morning's sun would rise upon a battle-field on the <rs>Potomac</rs>, where the <num value="2">two</num> great armies, for so many weeks gradually approaching each other, would be met in the thundering shock that would convulse the whole country, and decide the result of the contest between the <rs>Government</rs> and the rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>This expectation was not without reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>The crisis in the fate of the rebels is at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>Their chief taken from them by the hand of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> officer of their so-called Government prostrated with a loathsome disease in the midst of the army, the winter rapidly coming upon their forces, badly provided with clothing or food, more than decimated by disease, and at a loss for nearly all the requisites for an army, it has become for them a necessity to make immediately a desperate attack upon the <rs>Union</rs> army defending <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and the <rs>Potomac</rs>, or retire from the position they have assumed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>The attack was confidently expected to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>It has probably been prevented only by the heavy rain that began this morning and has lasted nearly all day. It cannot be much longer delayed, and will probably be begun with to-morrow's dawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>It would be absolute folly for the enemy to make a serious attack upon our front, defended, as it is, by a chain of fortifications, and more than a <num value="100">hundred</num> guns, so placed that their fire can be directed upon almost any <num value="1">one</num> point of the lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/><placeName key="tgn,2595792" n="1.000 2" reg="potomac river">The Potomac</placeName> flotilla is amply sufficient to prevent effectually any crossing of the lower Potomac anywhere within reaching distance of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>; and, although feigned attack will doubtless be made at all points, the principal assault will, probably, be in the direction of the <rs type="place">Chain Bridge</rs>, or at some point not a great deal farther up the river. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>His forces are so disposed as to be available wherever needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>It is more than probable, however, that the favorable time for the rebel attack is now already passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>If it had been made immediately after the <rs n="Battle of Bull Run" type="battle">battle of Bull Run</rs>, or even a week ago, or perhaps yesterday, there might have been some shadow of hope of their partial success; but to-day or to-morrow the game is in our own hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>If the attack should be attempted now, it will only be the preliminary to a complete repulse that will be so closely followed up that it will become a regular rout, followed by an army that is prepared in all respects for the <q>&#x0022;Onward to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>,&#x0022;</q> at the heels of the defeated rebels. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>He attends personally to every important preparation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>He has by this time looked into the face of almost every individual in this great army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>My single object now is to promote the continuance of these blessing to the people of this State. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/> Until within a brief period the people of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> were quiet and tranquil, free from domestic strife, and undisturbed by internal commotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>They have resisted no law, rebelled against no authority, engaged in no revolution, but constantly proclaimed their firm determination to pursue their peaceful avocations, earnestly hoping that her own soil would be spared the presence of armed troops, and that the scene of conflict would be kept removed beyond the border of their State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>By thus avoiding all occasions for the introduction of bodies of armed soldiers, and offering no provocation for the presence of military force, the people of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> have sincerely striven to preserve in their State domestic peace and avert the calamities of sanguinary engagements. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>Still can I not construe any of their votes as meaning that they will prosecute a coercive war against their Southern brethren.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>They meant only that they have still some hope of the restoration and perpetuation of the <rs>Union</rs>, and until that hope is blasted they will not alter their existing relations.
