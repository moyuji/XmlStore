These <measure n="5000000barrels" type="mass">five million bales</measure> furnished the material to employ, in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, <num value="33000000">thirty-three million</num> spindles; on the continent, <num value="12000000">twelve millions</num>; and in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, <num value="5000000">five millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>Estimating the capital employed in spinning, weaving and printing this crop as equal to <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">ten dollars</measure> per spindle, we have a result of <measure n="500000000dollars" type="currency">$500,000,000</measure> employed in the manufacture of this cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>To attend to this manufacture required about <num value="1000000">one million</num> of workmen, whose labors resulted in increasing the value of these <measure n="5000000barrels" type="mass">five million bales</measure> from <measure n="200000000dollars" type="currency">$200,000,000</measure> to about <measure n="500000000dollars" type="currency">$500,000,000</measure>. Estimating the average product per hand on the plantation at a little over <measure n="6barrels" type="mass">six bales</measure>, we have <num value="800000">eight hundred thousand</num> slaves employed in the production of this crop of <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, which, at the average value of <measure n="1250dollars" type="currency">$1,250</measure>--not a large price for field hands at that time &mdash; represents a capital of <measure n="1000000000dollars" type="currency">$1,000,000,000</measure> double the amount employed in its manufacture!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>Under the new system of labor which must now be adopted, it is hoped that in a few years the cost of production of the raw material will be reduced to a moiety of its former cost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>In other words, said the lecturer, imagine the <rs>Cotton States</rs> to be represented by a cheque-board of the usual <num value="64">sixty-four</num> squares, and the amount of land actually employed would be represented by <num value="1">one</num> square.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>There are still vast tracts of the <rs>Southern</rs>, and especially the <rs>Southwestern States</rs>, not now devoted to cotton culture, which can be profitably employed for that purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>The politicians are a disputatious, pestiferous and unproductive race, who never do any good to mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>They live in and for themselves, make a great noise and attract much attention, but they are like clouds which promise rain, and turn out nothing but wind, disappointing the thirsty earth and blowing dust in people's eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>They do not realize the fact that oratory is a thing of the past, and that great orators, like epic poets, belong to <num value="0.5">a half</num>-civilized age; that gentlemen meet here to <hi rend="italics">do,</hi> and not to <hi rend="italics">say;</hi> and that the best possible speaking is only an obstruction to business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>But when the rhetoric is not fine, and the logic not convincing, then affairs become much worse; then does lukewarm eloquence rule the hour, and diluted oratory take every form from the pompous periods of the gentleman from Puff Ball to the solid statistics of the gentleman from Leadenhead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>There are as many different sorts of bad oratory as there are different kinds of ugly men; and public speaking, like the human face, is deformed by narrowness of brow, dimness of eyesight, vacancy of expression, and superabundance of jaw. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/> For instance, there is the honorable gentleman who does &#x0022;not rise, <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, for the purpose of protracting this debate,&#x0022; and who immediately, then and there, does protract it. Then there is the gentleman who rises &#x0022;for the purpose of making only a single remark,&#x0022; and who proceeds at once to make a <num value="100">hundred</num> remarks &mdash; or, rather, the same remark a <num value="100">hundred</num> times over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>Another gentleman says he is very loth to occupy &#x0022;the time of the <name>Legislature</name> at this stage of the debate,&#x0022; and who straightway does violence to his feelings by consuming much of that time &mdash; time for which the <rs>State</rs> pays about <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">one thousand dollars</measure> a day. There are others who rise without apology, and who, with baleful self-possession, clear their throats, call for a glass of water, gather books and papers around them for reference and quotation, and go with great deliberation into the business of saving their country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/> If honorable gentlemen, who are orators, were listened to only by other honorable gentlemen, who are also orators, it would all be well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>The men who suffer would have their revenge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>But there are many steady old <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> gentlemen in the <name>Legislature</name> who never make speeches themselves, and who do not seem to be enchained by the eloquence of those who do. These gentlemen sometimes <hi rend="italics">do</hi> rise and give a few sentences of plain talk, or give straightforward answers to straightforward questions; and this is doing better than they would if they were all <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Henrys,,Patrick,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00212" reg="default:Henrys,Patrick,,,"><foreName>Patrick</foreName> <surname>Henrys</surname></persName>.</hi> In the <orgName n="English Parliament" type="parliament">English Parliament</orgName>, speech-making is obsolete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>Questions of the greatest importance to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and often to the world, are discussed in a colloquial way. Any gentleman attempting an oration would be coughed down at once, and deserve it, too. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/> There are many men who talk well enough, who cannot speak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>They make an elaborate exordium, prepared beforehand; and by the time they get to the end of that they find to their consternation that the portico is too big for the house; that after taking a high view of the subject in a high pitch of voice, that descent is impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>Then odd ends and odd beginnings of sentences come tumbling, leapfrog, from his lips; illogical deductions are drawn from absurd premises, and the hand held aloft for impassioned gesticulation has nothing in particular to do. And then the honorable member sits him down amid an appalling silence without having said what he fain would have said: what perhaps might have been of value; and what he could have said well enough if he had only talked without attempting to make a speech. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/> Or that our <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> and Legislators, in <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName>, would only realize how disgusting a thing it is to make a speech! </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> <milestone unit="column" n="3"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>He elaborated the argument that the so-called <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> were belligerents, and that during the war according to the decisions of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> <unclear> </unclear> Court and international law, the respective parties &#x0022;stood in the same relation to each other as if they were separate nations.&#x0022; Having conquered them as public enemies, he maintained that the <rs>Government</rs> had the right to treat them as conquered provinces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>Among the requirements which he advocated as precedent to the re-admission of these States, was the amendment of the <rs>Constitution</rs> so that there could be an election for <rs type="role2">President</rs> and a representation in Congress on the basis of population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>This, by recognizing the colored people of the <rs>South</rs>, would give the new States an increased representation in Congress.
