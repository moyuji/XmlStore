<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/> In the <orgName n="Richmond Whig" type="newspaper">Richmond <hi rend="italics">Whig</hi></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>of <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> last, we find a letter from <persName n="Stuart,,Alexander,H.,H.," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00195" reg="default:Stuart,Alexander,H.,H.,"><foreName>Alexander</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>, <rs type="role">Esq.</rs>, explanatory of the views upon the all-engrossing subject of the currency, addressed by him a short time since to <persName n="Armstrong,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00196" reg="mostcommon:Armstrong,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Armstrong</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>The propositions of <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> S. are stated with great clearness, and supported with consummate ability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing to be done is to stop the issue of more treasury notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>Unless this be done, all farther action upon the subject is evidently vain; for it is the redundancy of the currency that has raised prices to their present fabulous height, and that having occasioned the depreciation in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instance, renders its down-hill march inevitable as the volume increases.--The circulation is now <measure n="650000000dollars" type="currency">$650,000,000</measure>--the treasury issues <measure n="50000000dollars" type="currency">$50,000,000</measure> a month &mdash; in a year we shall have a circulation <measure n="1250000000dollars" type="currency">$1,250,000,000</measure>. A barrel of flour now sells for <measure n="50dollars" type="currency">$50</measure>--the price will keep pace with the increase of volume and diminution in value of the currency &mdash; in a year a barrel of flour will cost <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">$100</measure>. Everything continues to go up in the same ratio.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>No Government on earth can stand such a system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>There must be a radical reformation or we are done for. It belongs to Congress to make the reform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>It must not shrink from the task &mdash; it must do it speedily, and it must do it effectually. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/> The <rs n="printing press" type="product">printing press</rs> having been stopped, the next thing is to retire all of the outstanding treasury notes, except about <measure n="200000000dollars" type="currency">$200,000,000</measure> worth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>This might of course be done by a direct tax; but <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> S. thinks that would bear too hard on the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>The estimate of <persName n="Memminger,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00197" reg="mostcommon:Memminger,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Memminger</surname></persName> (<measure n="150000000dollars" type="currency">$150,000,000</measure>) for circulation is too small.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>It might have done when all the business of the country was done by means of credit and the machinery it employs, but will not answer now, when everything is cash.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>He proposes a tax and forced loan of <num value="12">twelve</num> <hi rend="italics">per cent.</hi> on all the property, real and personal, in that portion of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> which are still available for that purpose, according to the estimated value of the same recorded in the last census of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.--This estimated value is <measure n="4500000000dollars" type="currency">$4,500,000,000</measure> specie valuation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/><num value="0.12">Twelve per cent.</num> would give <measure n="540000000dollars" type="currency">$540,000,000</measure> for the tax, of which <measure n="450000000dollars" type="currency">$450,000,000</measure> could be applied to retiring the circulation, and <measure n="90000000dollars" type="currency">$90,000,000</measure> to the <rs>Government</rs> for its various necessities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>The laying of this tax and forced loan would have an immediate effect upon the currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>Everybody, instead of trying to shuffle off their treasury notes would be saving them, and looking out for more, in order to get money to pay the tax. The demand being thus prodigiously increased, the treasury notes would appreciate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>In a little time the withdrawal of so large a sum from circulation would occasion a scarcity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>The banks would come forward to supply the deficiency, and thus treasury notes and bank notes would be of equal value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>Every article would fall in nominal price as the currency appreciated, and we should soon find ourselves back in the state we were in at the beginning of the war. It appears to us that these effects are perfectly demonstrable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/> For the ultimate payment of the debt thus incurred, an export duty on cotton, tobacco, and naval stores is proposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>It has been objected to this, that the cotton States would not agree to it. It is easily demonstrable that it would do them no injury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>It has been argued that it would throw the greater portion of the burthen upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>This argument is founded on the assumption that the producer of the cotton pays the export duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>This is not true to the full extent of the assumption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>Who is the producer?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>Is it the man who owns the land and plants and cultivates the cotton?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>To a certain extent it is. But this man must have slaves to work his land, meat and bread to feed them, and clothes to hide their nakedness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>He must have, also, hoes, plows, and gins; oxen, mules, and horses; hogs, salt, barns, engines, &#x0026;c. --This tax, then, falling <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> on the man who cultivated the cotton, in <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> or <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, would ramify backwards, and spread itself over the hog raisers and cloth manufacturers of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, the iron workers in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> and <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>--in <num value="1">one</num> word, over every State which furnished the materials for carrying on the work of the plantation. --Thus, if it were true that an export duty fell on the producer, we find that it would be shared by all who supplied his wants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>But it is not true, absolutely, at least. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/> It has been said that the <hi rend="italics">consumer</hi> pays the duty, as it is now said that the producer pays it. Both propositions are true and both false.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>If a duty be laid upon an article with which the market is glutted, and for which there is little demand, the producer pays, of course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>On the other hand, if a duty be laid on an article which is very scarce, and for which there is a great demand, the consumer pays.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>If the <name>Legislature</name> lay a tax of <measure n="2dollars" type="currency">two dollars</measure> on flour, which is greatly in demand and scarce, the holder charges <measure n="2dollars" type="currency">two dollars</measure> more for his flour, and the consumer pays it. On the other hand were the same tax laid on a barrel of flour, and, our ports being opened, the quantity should be increased until it was a mere Arug, the producer, being obliged to sell his flour at a loss, would pay the tax and have no means of reimbursing himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>Now, this is exactly the condition of Southern cotton, as the war has proved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>Before the war the planter was glad to get <measure n="12cents" type="currency">twelve cents</measure> for it. Now it sells readily in <placeName reg="Liverpool, Yazoo, Mississippi" key="tgn,2463110">Liverpool</placeName> and New York for <measure n="72cents" type="currency">seventy-two cents</measure>. We have therefore the entire control of the market, and no competitors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/><placeName reg="Bharat" key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName>, <placeName reg="Misr" key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, <placeName reg="Africa" key="tgn,7001242">Southern Africa</placeName>, and the <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550">West Indies</placeName> have all failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>We can sell our staple always at what price we please, laying on the tax.--Thus it cannot fall on the cotton planter.--The amount of cotton exported before the war was about <measure n="4000000barrels" type="mass">4,000,000 bales</measure> of <measure n="500l." type="pounds"><num value="500">500</num> pounds</measure> each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>Say that loss of labor will reduce that amount <num value="1000000">one million</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>We have still <num value="3000000">three million</num>, and a duty of <measure n="10cents" type="currency">ten cents</measure> a pound would bring <measure n="150000000dollars" type="currency">$150,000,000</measure>. This would pay the interest on <measure n="2000000000dollars" type="currency">$2,000,000,000</measure>, and leave us <measure n="30000000dollars" type="currency">$30,000,000</measure>. What has been said of cotton is true of tobacco.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>We have the control of the market, and can make <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> pay our taxes out of it. Both <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> have been raising enormous revenues out of it. Let us make them pay more for it in future. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/> It is of importance, in the meantime, to pay as we go, so far as we can, in order to avoid, as far as possible, an accumulation of debt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>The ability to-pay must come from a regular and vigorous system of taxation.--But we have transcended our limits, and must conclude with recommending <persName n="Stuart,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00198" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Alexander,H.,H.,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>'s plan to the serious consideration of the country. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>The colossal frauds practiced to stiff this vote cannot stifle out of existence the <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> voters, nor conceal from the world the fact that an immense majority of the legal voters of <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName> are opposed to the <name>Administration</name> of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00200" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and sanction the course of <persName n="Vallandigham,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00201" reg="mostcommon:Vallandigham,nomatch:0"><surname>Vallandigham</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>Its confidence is in bayonets, and thus far its confidence does not appear to have been misplaced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>So far as we are concerned it does not seem to matter much whether the <rs>North</rs> is for or against the war.
