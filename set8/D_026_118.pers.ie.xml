<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> The news from the <rs>Southside</rs> is meagre, though interesting as showing the extent of the enemy's defeat in the <rs n="Battle of Monday" type="battle">battle of Monday</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Our forces continued the pursuit until the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were driven across <persName n="Proctor,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Proctor,nomatch:0"><surname>Proctor</surname></persName>'s <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>, a distance of <placeName><distance reg="3miles">three miles</distance> below <placeName reg="Drewry's Bluff, Chesterfield, Virginia" key="tgn,2295265">Drewry's Bluff</placeName></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The latest advices represent that they had gone to their entrenchments in the <unclear></unclear> of <placeName reg="Bermuda Hundreds">Bermuda Hundreds</placeName>, and under cover of their gunboats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The line of battle extended from the river to the <orgName n="Petersburg Railroad" type="railroad">Petersburg Railroad</orgName>, and formed the segment of a circle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/><persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> had received information that the enemy contemplated an attack upon his left, and that they had <unclear> </unclear> troops on their right for the purpose, expecting, no doubt, to break through our lives with comparative case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Acting upon this, he strengthened his left without weakening his right, and, without waiting for them to commence operations, made the attack himself, with the result already known to our readers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The report that the battle recommence about <time value="6oclock">six o'clock</time> on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time> was erroneous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>There was some artillery firing from our side, but the enemy did not respond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>During the day our forces <measure n="4" type="captured">captured four</measure> guns, <num value="4">four</num> stand of colors, and considerably over a <measure n="1000" type="prisoners">thousand prisoners</measure>. The enemy's loss in killed and wounded is unknown, though it was probably heavy, About <num value="200">two hundred</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> wounded were brought in at <placeName reg="Drewry's Bluff, Chesterfield, Virginia" key="tgn,2295265">Drewry's Bluff</placeName> yesterday, and were expected up last night. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>It is reported that a large number of prisoners were captured. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> The battle was not renewed yesterday.--The firing heard in the afternoon proceeded from <placeName reg="Chaffin's Bluff">Chaffin's Bluff</placeName>, where our artillery opened on the enemy's gunboats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The engagement lasted but a short time, and had so important result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>A report prevailed yesterday that the enemy were throwing a large force across to the north side of the river below <placeName reg="Chaffin's Bluff">Chaffin's Bluff</placeName>, but this is not credited in official quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>That they have some force in that locality is proved by the act that our pickets below the <rs type="place">Bluff</rs> were driven in yesterday morning by infantry, but their numerical strength is not believed to be large. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> At <time value="5oclock">five o'clock</time> <time>yesterday</time> evening the enemy's gunboats were in full view of <placeName reg="Chaffin's Bluff">Chaffin's Bluff</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The Beast appears to be unpopular, even with his own officers.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/> There is nothing new to add to the condition of the struggle for <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> to day.--The last great fight in <placeName reg="Spotsylvania, Spotsylvania, Virginia" key="tgn,2114316">Spotsylvania</placeName> no doubt alluded the enemy for a day or <num value="2">two</num>, and he is looking about to see how he may better his situation for the next encounter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>He must be terribly damaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>No army could lose half its force in the battle field without a sense of exhaustion and soreness that would require, at least, temporary rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>We may suppose, reasonably enough, that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00258" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Gen,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> has had at least half of his army put <hi rend="italics">hors de combal</hi> Our well informed correspondent estimates his force at <num value="92000">92,000</num> <hi rend="italics">musksis,</hi> which would make his entire force, of all descriptions, fully <num value="150000">150,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>The enemy's own reports acknowledged a loss of <num value="35000">35,000</num> in the engagements before his abandonment of the <placeName reg="Germanna">Germanna</placeName> road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>Since then there have been at least <num value="3">three</num> heavy engagements near <placeName reg="Spotsylvania Court House">Spotsylvania Court House</placeName>, in the last of which the general estimate is that he lost fully <num value="20000">20,000</num> men; his columns, stimulated to enthusiasm, if not to fury, by lies as to <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> victories and by whiskey, rushing <hi rend="italics">enmasse</hi> upon our defences, were, mowed down like grain by the reaper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>If we put down <num value="15000">15,000</num> for the remaining sanguinary conflicts of the eventful <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure> of fighting, we have <num value="70000">70,000</num> men &mdash; within a fraction of half the force we may suppose to be the outside of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00259" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Gen,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s number. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/> How a General, with such losses, can persist in the movement which involved them, is a little wonderful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>But the indications are that he persists in it, and is only man&#x0153;uvering for another effort to flank that glorious Confederate force which has baffled every attack he has yet made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>With the knowledge of what has occurred, in this very remarkable campaign of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> armies, our people can feel no serious apprehensions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>That desperate strategy which spurns the rules of prudence and is reckless of human life &mdash; which essays to achieve victories simply by the force and weight of brute numbers precipitated against columns formed of soldiers of unsurpassed courage and <hi rend="italics">morale</hi>--should excite no real alarm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>We know who defends <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, who holds the key to this struggle, and we rely implicitly upon him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/> On the <rs>Southside</rs> there was a pause yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>The enemy made no effort to recover the advantages lost in the engagement of <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>, in which the superior gallantry and heroism of the <rs>Confederates</rs> were so conspicuously displayed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/> With our recent advantages and victories we may at least be content for a day, hoping that the week will bring in at least <num value="1">one</num> crowning triumph to make us all glad. </p> </div3>
