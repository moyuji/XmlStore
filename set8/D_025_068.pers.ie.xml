<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>A surprise, on the contrary, is a military crime of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> magnitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>It involves the absence of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> principles of military character, of that vigilance, discipline, system, and caution which are as essential to success as courage and fortitude.
