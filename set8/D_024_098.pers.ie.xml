<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/> Several Federal journals intimate that no active her hostilities on their part need be expected this <unclear></unclear> but that the <rs>North</rs> will stand on the defective till autumn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>Various reasons are assigned for this important modification of the &#x0022;short-sharp, and decisive&#x0022; It is alleged that the <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> men, embracing a large number of their most efficient soldiers, will soon be discharged, and that their army generally is not in a condition to assume the aggressive, whilst the <rs>Southern</rs> army, on the other hand, was never in a more efficient state, both as regards discipline and numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>It is further asserted that the reins and bad roads of this season in the <rs>South</rs> forbid a spring campaign, whilst summer operations, they have learned by experience, are not to be thought of. During the summer they can gather in and drill their now conscripts, and by autumn be prepared to take the field once more and crush the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>In the meantime their great hope is that the <rs>South</rs> will suffer from want of food and be so financially strangulated that, when the hour of battle comer we shall not be able to stand up against the over whelming masses of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>They profess, also, to believe that, rather than waste the internal in inaction, we shall attack them in their strongholds, when they will have all the advantages of a defensive position, and we shall suffer as they have whenever they have been the assailants. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/> Whether a particle of confidence ought, to be placed in these prognostications, we leave to those who can see through the murky waters of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> deception to the bottom, to decide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>Our Government and our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> understand too thoroughly the slimy, tortuous ways of Yankeedom, to be put off their guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>All this may be only a prelude to some sudden and desperate rush of the <rs>Federal</rs> armies at a vital point of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>It is impossible for us to put faith in anything these people say. It seems improbable that, if they intended to remain inactive during the <rs type="season">spring</rs> and <rs type="season">summer</rs>, they would inform us of it. Their real object, therefore, may be to full us into a dream of security, and spring upon us as we sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>If, however, their armies are so disorganized and demoralized that they cannot push on till next fall, what becomes of the late emphatic declarations of the <orgName n="New York Tribune" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi></orgName>, that if the rebels were not conquered in <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>, the <rs>North</rs> might as wall give up the contest; and the threat of the <hi rend="italics">Herald,</hi> that unless the rebellion were crushed before fall, <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00115" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and his Cabinet ought to be impeached?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>Can the <rs>North</rs> afford to wait <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>, with an enormous debt rolling up mountain high every day, on the fragile hope that the <rs>South</rs> will be starved or whipped out next fall?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>What reason have they to calculate on the <rs>South</rs> being starved out?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>Even if our condition were now as close on the borders of famine as their journals represent, how do they know but the same beneficent <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> which has hitherto so interposed wonderfully in our behalf will not crown the labors of our husband men with plenty, and give us abundant harvests?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>As to their conquering us by any other mode than starvation, we do not believe they themselves after the experience of the past have the slightest confidence in such an achievement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>If they wait till fall they need not expect that the <rs>North</rs> will be the only party prepared for the conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/> --The annual meeting of the <orgName n="Male Orphan Society" type="society">Male Orphan Society</orgName> was held at the <orgName n="Sycamore Church" type="church">Sycamore Church</orgName> on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time> last, but owing to the state of the weather the audience was so small &mdash; not more than <num value="20">twenty</num> gentle men being present &mdash; that the interesting facts then elicited were made known to very few. The duty of drawing up a brief summary of these, and promulgating the same, was, by order of the meeting, devolved upon the undersigned. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/> The annual report, with the accompanying accounts of the <rs>Treasurer</rs>, showed that the limited fixed income of the <name>Society</name>, with the advance in the prices of food, clothing, and fuel compelled the managers to reject all further applications, so far back as <dateStruct value="-04-"><month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct> of last year, under the painful conviction that so far from being able to increase the number of orphans already within the asylum, it would require the utmost economy to support those then under their care.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>This apprehension proved to be well founded, for it now appears that, notwithstanding the superior management, wise forces, and unceasing industry of the lady in charge, the funds fell short, of inevitable expenses, by the sum of <measure n="800dollars" type="currency">eight hundred dollars</measure> and upwards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>It is a gratifying circumstance to be able to state that this deficiency was contributed by the company present, small as it was on the spot, and by this prompt action the <name>Society</name> is relieved of the burden of debt. </p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/> The sum of <measure n="6000dollars" type="currency">six thousand dollars</measure>, in addition to the certain income, it is hoped, will be sufficient to support the <num value="25">twenty-five</num> now cared for, and to introduce a few others, whose claims are most urgent; but should the hearts of the people be so touched by this plain statement of facts as to call forth a contribution beyond the <unclear></unclear> named, they may be assured that such excess will find ready employment in extending still further the benefits of the institution. </p>
