<head>Additional particulars from the <rs>Plymouth</rs> fight.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> We gave on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> some of the particulars of the fighting which resulted in the capture of <placeName reg="Plymouth, Washington, North Carolina" key="tgn,2076159">Plymouth</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Our forces arrived in front of <placeName reg="Plymouth, Washington, North Carolina" key="tgn,2076159">Plymouth</placeName> on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time> about <time value="4oclock">4 o'clock</time>, and succeeded in capturing most of the enemy's pickets, which were stationed a few miles from town, and felt their works, and finding them much stronger than was anticipated, the men being exhausted by a long day's march, the attack was postponed until next day. During the whole day Monday the artillery and sharpshooters were engaged with their gunboats and forts, which resulted in <num value="1">one</num> of the former being sunk.--At about dusk on the same evening <placeName reg="Fort Sanderson">Fort Sanderson</placeName>, a very strong earthwork, was assaulted and carried by storm after a spirited resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>During this assault a number of our men were killed by hand grenades in the ditch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>After carrying the above-named fort our forces advanced close up to the main works of the enemy, on the west side of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> at <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time> the <rs>Albemarle</rs>, <num value="1">one</num> of our iron-clad gunboats, commanded by <persName n="Cook,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Cook,T.,J.,,:1"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Cook</surname></persName>, came down the river and engaged the enemy's batteries and gunboats which were lying in front of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The enemy's boats attempted to board her, which attack was handsomely repulsed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>They also attempted to trap her, having stretched a chain under water across the space that intervened between their boats; but instead of running between them <persName n="Cook,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Cook,T.,J.,,:1"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Cook</surname></persName> made direct for the largest, striking her amidships, and sunk her in a few minutes, together with most of the officers and crew, only a few of whom were picked up. He immediately engaged the other, and pursued her some distance down the river, but not deeming it prudent to venture too far down the river, he returned to his former position in front of <placeName reg="Plymouth, Washington, North Carolina" key="tgn,2076159">Plymouth</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> After daylight on the same morning <persName n="Hoke,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Hoke,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Hoke</surname></persName> demanded a surrender of the place and its defences, which demand the enemy declined to accede to. During the day their works were reconnoitered and felt at different points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/><dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> the position of our troops was moved around through a very difficult route to the east or opposite side of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>At <time>daylight</time> <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> they charged and carried the entire line of fortifications on the east side, driving the enemy at the point of the bayonet completely through the town to the opposite side, where some of our troops were left, who succeeded in capturing a large number of prisoners. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> During all day Tuesday and <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> the <rs>Albemarle</rs>, with the gallant <rs>Cook</rs> in command, engaged the enemy's batteries, taking them in reverse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The town now being entirely in our possession, together with all the enemy's works, with the exception of the main fort, a demand was made for its surrender, which was refused, but as soon as our sharpshooters commenced to advance, the enemy began to desert by twos, threes and twenties, coming into our lines and throwing down their arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The flag of the fort was then soon hauled down, which resulted in the surrender by <persName n="Wessels,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Wessels,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brig. Gen.</roleName> <surname>Wessels</surname></persName> of <num value="4">four</num> regiments of infantry, <num value="1">one</num> squadron of cavalry, a battalion of artillery, and <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> companies of N. C. &#x0022;Buffaloes,&#x0022; together with the large amount of stores, provisions, siege guns, etc., previously reported in this paper. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> Our loss in killed and wounded in the land fight was much larger than that of the enemy, owing to the fact that our troops were exposed to a raking fire, without protection of any kind, while the enemy were covered by their works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Our total loss was <measure n="300" type="killed and wounded">three hundred killed and wounded</measure>, while the loss of the enemy in this respect only amounted to <num value="100">one hundred</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The number of prisoners captured was as follows: <num value="2500">2,500</num> whites and <num value="300">300</num> negroes, a portion of the latter being women and children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>A large number of negroes and &#x0022;buffaloes&#x0022; (fit associates) escaped by means of boats and canoes, while quite a number plunged into the river, a portion of whom never reached the opposite shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The behavior of our troops throughout the whole affair was everything that could be desired, and where all did so well it would be next to injustice to discriminate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The gallant <persName n="Mercer,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Mercer,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Mercer</surname></persName> was killed while leading a charge, and thus scaled with his lifeblood his devotion to his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>He was a native of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, and the only field officer lost by us during the siege of <placeName reg="Plymouth, Washington, North Carolina" key="tgn,2076159">Plymouth</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> The following named officers and privates wounded in the recent engagement before <placeName reg="Plymouth, Washington, North Carolina" key="tgn,2076159">Plymouth, N.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>On the subject of the <name>Abolition</name> proclamation of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00177" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, he took upon himself the task of maintaining its constitutionality and lawfulness.--Thus he abandons his people and his State--betraying what it was his highest duty to defend even with his life's blood &mdash; to propitiate the <rs>Lincoln</rs> despotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>Contrasting his former standing with his present position in the harness of Black Republicanism, working kindly with the basest and most brutal of Northern subjugationists and rebel crushers, we see how low a man may fall when he loses his self-respect, and when integrity, honesty, and every public and private virtue is made to give way to a corrupt ambition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>Yet not withstanding his abandonment of every duty to his countrymen and his State, he recently stood up in the <name>Senate</name> and discussed very coolly a proposition to restrict the issues of the <rs>State Banks</rs> as <num value="1">one</num> that was in conflict with the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the rights of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>It was not unlike the feeble flare of an expiring candle, or the fitful utterance of a rational and coherent remark by a madman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>Nothing could seem to be a more perfect mockery than for this aged traitor to attempt now a defence of State rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>It must have produced a grin upon the faces of all of his saturnine companions in the work of destroying the <rs>Constitution</rs> and crushing the liberties of the <rs>Republic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>It were charity to suppose that with his very old age comes feebleness and a waning intellect; and, as is often the case, as his intellect declines his vanity and conceit, and his ambition, (always inordinate,) have grown in an inverse ratio.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>This condition of the man would, indeed, entitle him to pity; but, nevertheless, it places him irretrievably in that throng of public men in the <rs>Northern Government</rs> whose virtue was not strong enough to resist temptation, and who will be handed down by the history of these times to the execration of mankind. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/> The resolution moved by Sehuyler Co'fax, <rs type="role" reg="Speaker">Speaker</rs> of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>, for the expulsion of <persName n="Long,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00179" reg="mostcommon:Long,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Long</surname></persName>, by way of preamble, entered a bill of indictment against the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>He charged solemnly that they had been guilty of the great crime of erecting an independent Government out of Territory belonging to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>And he charged, furthermore, that they had been killing the soldiers of the <rs>Union</rs> sent to assert the authority of the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States Government</orgName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>How the <rs>South</rs> is ever to vindicate itself before the world from these terrible accusations, it is hard to say. It certainly cannot deny them altogether.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>We may make an answer part of confession and part denial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>We may say that we have not taken territory that belonged to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government, of which said <persName n="Colfax,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00180" reg="mostcommon:Colfax,nomatch:0"><surname>Colfax</surname></persName> appears as the prosecuting attorney, since that territory belonged to the <name>States</name> which have dissolved partnership with the agreeable and loveable political family represented by said <persName n="Colfax,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00181" reg="mostcommon:Colfax,nomatch:0"><surname>Colfax</surname></persName>, and, of course, went with them, and cannot be dissevered from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>But as to the killing of the <rs>Union</rs> soldiers, that is too true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>The &#x0022;offence is rank,&#x0022;and at least reaches the sensibilities of the virtuous denizen of the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>How so grave an offence is to be atoned, we cannot imagine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>It is similar in character (but of incomparably greater magnitude) to shooting a robber of the hen-roost; killing the wolf in the sheep-fold; ending the existence of an amiable grisly bear found bearing off a petted and fatted heifer; hanging upon the nearest tree a dog caught killing a sheep; giving the quietus to a house-breaker as he forces the door, pistol in hand, to defend himself in his lawful occupation &mdash; or any other such brutal deeds of blood and murder perpetrated against such like gentle and peaceable animals and amiable citizens in the pursuit of the lawful occupation of appropriating to themselves other people's property, and promoting the good of society!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>The world will stand aghast at the hardihood of the <rs>South</rs> in raising the arm to strike down the benevolent and philanthropic Union soldiers who come to the <rs>Southern</rs> land to carry out purposes full as gentle, humane, and honest as any ever undertaken by any of the aforementioned animals, who have not been, it would appear, properly appreciated heretofore by mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government, however, is about to place them, and the <rs>Union</rs> soldiers along with them, in a new light, and, it may be supposed, will put them in a way to be relieved of the unjust odium heaped upon them by popular opinion! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/> We apprehend that the <rs>South</rs>, while confessing its enormous sin in this respect, is not properly repentant; but is obdurately bent on pursuing it further.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>They have lately been doing horrible deeds amongst numbers of these Union soldiers, who came amongst them with the best intentions, and with hearts overflowing with the milk of human kindness!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>It is a piece of casuistry that the <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> render will very much enjoy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>We quote the following extracts from the same: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/> Evidently, in the eyes of the strictly moral <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>, we have entered upon an evil and victory course of conduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>It is clear that they cannot allow their own methods of warfare to be any precedent for us. At <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, for example, at though they have not stormed that city, and cannot take it by slege, mine, starvation or bombardment, they feel it to be their duty, at any rate, to throw <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName> fire amongst the non combatant population of the city in order to bring them to a wholesome sense of their crimes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>Richmond. which they cannot take by storm, and which was not called on to surrender as <placeName key="tgn,6002083" n="1.000 95" reg="fort pillow, lauderdale, tennessee">Fort Pillow</placeName> was, they may dash into by way of surprise, give it up to indiscriminate sack, slaughter and conflagration at the hands of infuriated released prisoners, and hang the <rs type="role" reg="civil-Officer">civil officers</rs> of our Government upon trees at their own doors; and the contemplation of scenes like these does not make their hearts sicken, nor their blood run chill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/><num value="1">One</num> cannot but infer that there is some great intrinsic difference in the cause on the <num value="1">one</num> side, and on the other, turning that which is held legitimate warfare on their part into barbarous murder when perpetrated by us!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>and a difference there certainly is, which, to the careless observer, would seem rather in our favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>We are not invading their country, nor holding, nor seeking to hold, any place which belongs to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>We are not blockading their rivers, nor shelling their beach, nor pillaging their property; are not trying to starve them to death and to break their hearts by mere hunger and hardship; only desire in short to have nothing whatsoever to do with them any more for ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>Under these circumstances it might be too hastily concluded that we may lawfully permit ourselves at least as strong measures for defence as our enemies use for offence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>But in fact the true difference &mdash; and it alters the whole case &mdash; is that our Northern brethren are in the position of officers of the law bringing criminals to justice; we in the position of burglars and brigands resisting the authorities, and the sheriff may do to the highwayman what the highwayman must not do to the sheriff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>The constable may shoot, or starve out, or smoke out, or blow up, the resisting burglar, because he has a lawful warrant; but if the burglar perpetrate these enormities upon the constable it chills the blood and sickens the heart. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/> &#x0022;This,&#x0022; says the <hi rend="italics">Examiner,</hi><q>&#x0022;is the theory and the practice of our enemies.&#x0022;</q> Felicitating the country upon the events at <placeName key="tgn,6002083" n="1.000 95" reg="fort pillow, lauderdale, tennessee">Fort Pillow</placeName> as likely to inaugurate the policy of more clearly asserting our <hi rend="italics">rights as belligerents,</hi> and rejecting altogether the character of criminals resisting the authority of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, the <hi rend="italics">Examiner</hi>concludes thus: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/> The Confederacy, if it is to remain a Confederacy, cannot afford, cannot endure, to stand on any lower ground; and this our enemies know well; their affected horror at our doings is not pure, unmeaning impudence; it has a wise and politic purpose; and that purpose is, by constant reiteration of their own theory and steady ignoring of ours, to gain insensibly that moral superiority which makes the criminal quail before the constable; and thus to lower the tone of our military spirit, and breathe into our soldiers a certain fearful looking for judgment, which would make their hearts melt in their bosoms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/> The decisive campaign of the war is opening; the last campaign as we firmly hope and believe; for these <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> and their war grown tiresome; It were well to have done with them and it; and to set about the work this <num value="1">one</num> good time in the style that is sure to put it through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>For so desirable an end all that is needed is a spirit high and keen, and such a fierce, unsparing temper as will &#x0022;sicken the heart&#x0022; of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>, and make his thin blood run cold. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
