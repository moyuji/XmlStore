<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>He says <q>&#x0022;the rebel army actually in action at <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName> numbered close upon <num value="50000">50,000</num> men, well officered, well entrenched, protected by masked batteries, and abundantly supplied with artillery.&#x0022;</q> This is a lie out of the whole cloth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The battle was fought upon unfortified ground; there was not an entrenchment or a masked battery within miles of it. What is said of our officers is true; but all the rest is sheer falsehood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>They certainly did not number less than <num value="35000">thirty-five thousand</num> men. <num value="1">One</num> of the captured officers said they were from <num value="37000">thirty-seven</num> to <num value="40000">forty thousand</num> strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>In order to ride as light as possible, I gave my rifle and baggage to a servant and told him to await my return &mdash; not expecting to be gone more than <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/> At <placeName key="tgn,2112188" n="1.000 9" reg="haymarket, prince william, virginia">Haymarket</placeName> I stopped for the night, being completely knocked up by the fatigues of the day and of the previous march from <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> to Piedmont Sleeping late next morning &mdash; the glorious <rs>Sunday</rs>, the <num value="21" type="ordinal">21st</num>--late at least for a soldier, we were at breakfast about <time value="7oclock">7 o'clock</time>, when it was announced that the battle had begun, as the quick recurring discharges of cannon were distinctly heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>It was at once proposed that a party of us, all of whom were strangers to me, should proceed to the battle-ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>I was unarmed, but such was my desire to see a battle, particularly such as I knew this promised to be, I acceded, and away we went, under the guidance of some of the neighboring citizens, who said they knew all the by-ways of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>They led us by a tortuous route, and it was not till <time value="10:30">half past 10</time> that we reached the field; and when we got there I was completely <q>&#x0022;turned round,&#x0022;</q> and, as I found out after wards, was on the <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName> of our line of battle, instead of the right, as I then supposed </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>The part of the battle ground upon which we entered had not been very hotly contested previous us to our arrival; but, instantly after coming up, it became and continued for hours the <q> &#x0022;<unclear>r dd </unclear>&#x0022;</q> part of the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>The persons who came with me I saw no more after reaching the some of the conflict Unable to find any of our <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> people that I knew, I was thrown with a regiment which I was afterwards told was from <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>--probably the <num value="6" type="ordinal">6th</num>--which just then was making and ineffectual attempt to form on a ridge to pointblank range of a large battery of the enemy, then playing on that part of our lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>The regiment, however, fell back a little way to the left and formed in good order behind a farmhouse and the adjacent out buildings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>About tois time a piece of our artillery came upon the scene at that point, and after some delay opened fire upon the enemy in beautiful style.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>I sat on my horse near this gun for some time, the enemy's shot and shell whizzing by and falling thick and fast around.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>The shot from a rifled cannon makes a peculiar muscle, which, to be appreciated, must be heard &mdash; it cannot be described.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>The bursting of bombs in the air, too, is a sight to see &mdash; the long drawn-out whirr of a Minnie ball &mdash; of a hailstorm of them &mdash; the small cannon like report of many <num value="1000">thousand</num> muskets &mdash; all made up a concert well worth going a <measure n="1000miles" type="distance">thousand miles</measure> to attend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>And yet, strange to say, I was not in the least apprehensive of danger to myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>All sense of fear was swallowed up in the <num value="1">one</num> grand idea that we had that day before us an enemy who, whatever his numbers, must be that day whipped. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/> After tarrying awhile by the side of our troops at the point where I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> smell the powder and heard the roar of a real battlefield, I descried on the hill in front of us &mdash; the hill where, further to the left, stood the house so terribly riddled afterwards by the cannon shot of the enemy, in which they killed the old woman, notwithstanding he hospital flag then floating over it &mdash; another regiment, which I hoped might be <num value="1">one</num> from <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>I immediately formed the determination to join it I started down the hill under a cross fire from a battery to the left, and another in front, which I now suppose to have been <unclear>S erman's,</unclear> such was the incessant roar of its guns and the explosion of its shalls and hissing of its <unclear> lls</unclear> all around and above me. I had, however, advanced only half way up the opposite hill when I was met by the regiment, I was seeking, rapidly falling back, but in good order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Many of the men were wounded, and many came down the hill with their faces all streaming with blood and begrimed with powder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>This regiment, I am informed, was the <orgName type="regiment" key="AL4">Fourth Alabama</orgName>, which suffered so severely and acted so nobly throughout the entire day. It proceeded to form, if I am not mistaken, along with the <orgName type="mil" key="NCRegiment">North Carolina regiment</orgName>, behind the crest of the hill and beyond the range of the enemy's guns. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/> All this time the rattle of rifles and musketry, as well as the grander music of artillery, was unceasing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>It was observed by many old soldiers, after the battle, that they had never before known the discharges of rifles and musketry to be so sharp and continuous throughout so long an action &mdash; an action that lasted from <time value="7am">7 in the morning</time> to <time value="7pm">7 in the evening</time>. And this, too, notwithstanding, the now well established fact that there were <num value="6">six</num> distinct bayonet charges made by the <rs>Confederates</rs> during the day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/> It was now about <time value="1oclock">1 o'clock</time>, and as the troops I happened to be with seemed to be with seemed to be waiting for reinforcements, and as I was unarmed and there was no prospect of getting arms where I then was, I concluded to go again in search of a Mississippi regiment, knowing the gallant <num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num>, under the command of my <unclear> ow</unclear> renowned friend Faulgner, to be somewhere in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>For this purpose I started off, as I then thought, on the side of the field next <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>Unfortunately, I was mistaken in the course, and knowing nothing of our line or order of battle <unclear> de</unclear> in the direction of <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName>.--On rising the next hill, a shell struck a rock within a few feet of me, and exploding, threw the dust over me and the horse in a way that was not very compatible with <num value="1">one</num>'s notions of safety, but was still exciting, especially to the horse, who bounded into the air as if he had been struck with a fragment of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> iron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>This shell must have been thrown at me by <orgName n="Battery"><persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00030" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s Battery</orgName>, then probably a mile and <num value="0.5">a half</num> distant. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/> Riding forward a few yards further, I perceived in a little glen or having a party of soldiers, numbering, I suppose, about <num value="40">forty</num>, dressed in a uniform exactly similar to many of those worn in the <rs>Confederate</rs> service, and all armed with the improved <placeName reg="Springfield, Greene, Missouri" key="tgn,7014532">Springfield</placeName> musket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>Of course, I did not dream for an instant that they were other than Southerners and Secessionists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>Riding directly up to, and accosting them, a brief colloquy ensued, of which the following is the substance: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/> <q>&#x0022;Well, boys,&#x0022;</q> said I, <q>&#x0022;I believe those batteries over yonder are, for the present, a little too much for our people on the hill.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/> <q>&#x0022;Oh, no,&#x0022;</q> replied <num value="1">one</num> of them, <q>&#x0022;we are carrying the day everywhere. &#x0022;</q> (And so they were up to <time value="1:5pm">1&#x00BD; P. M.</time>) </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/> <q>&#x0022;Well,&#x0022;</q> said I, <q>&#x0022;who are you, and where are you from?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/> &#x0022;Where the devil are you from <unclear></unclear> quick response, in true <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> fashion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/> Seeing I was in for it, I replied, <unclear></unclear> and proudly, &#x0022;I am from <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, <unclear></unclear> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/> Instantly, an officer sprang up and <unclear></unclear><q>&#x0022;Take that man!&#x0022;</q> and the whole <unclear></unclear> their guns and surrounded me. There <unclear></unclear> was, in their midst, totally unarmed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>What could I do but surrender men prisoner of <unclear>war </unclear> I did so. I was dismounted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>They searched me for arms, but found none.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>The officer of the detachment got on my horse, and when the panic came, ran away with him!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>But I understand that both horse and man were killed by a cannon shot from <num value="1">one</num> of our batteries in the rout.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>So much for the gallant bay who bore me through what little I saw of the immortal field of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/> My captors carried me by devious ways to a detachment of their troops, probably <num value="1500">1,500</num> strong, posted in a neighboring wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>From thence they were ordered to convey me to the rear, which they proceeded to do, treating me kindly and politely by the way. Indeed, I may here say, once for all, to the credit of the great <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation, that, except in a single it stance, I experienced nothing but polite and respectful treatment while I was a captive in their hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>The single instance referred to was that of a very common sol- </p> <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/> dier, who it seems, had just lost his brother in the fight, and who came up and, pointing to me, said he wanted to shoot <q>&#x0022;that d &mdash; d <hi rend="italics"><unclear></unclear>. </hi>&#x0022;</q> My guards sternly ordered him off, and even threatened to shoot him if he did not at once absent himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>But this is anticipating for the incident happened after we reached the rear. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>The rear of the enemy's forces to which I was next conducted was then at a point a mile and <num value="0.5">a half</num> or <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> this side of <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName>, at a farm-house beyond and to the right of which lot extensive field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>To the left there is a shirt of woods, sufficiently extensive to screen a brigade and a battery of <num value="4">four</num> guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>But of this farther on. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/> Arrived at the rear, we found there a large body of men, <unclear></unclear> judge, to near <num value="10000">10,000</num>, scattered over the field and in the grounds around the farm-house, all in <unclear>dis rr y</unclear> and all elate with the victory which they then deemed assured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>They brought out a chair for me, and a large crowd gathered around, asking innumerable question, but at the same time politely assuring me I need not answer unless I choose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>They asked me how many men we had in the field that day? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/> I told them I did not know, and that if I aid I should not tell them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>However, I added, I shouldn't be surprised if we had at least <num value="69000">69,000</num> men on the ground and as many more only a few miles off. They said they had <num value="40000">40,000</num> in the field and <unclear><num value="40">40</num> <num value="0">0</num> <num value="0">0</num> n</unclear> reserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>The windows and balcony of the <rs>Eutaw</rs> were packed with ladies, whilst every available space in the street surrounding the hotel was crowded to excess.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/> A few minutes afterwards <persName n="Breckinridge,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00194" reg="mostcommon:Breckinridge,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Breckinridge</surname></persName> appeared on the balcony of the hotel fronting on <address><street n="Eutaw street">Eutaw street</street></address>, when he was again cheered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>He began by expressing his surprise at the demonstration, as he had not expected so large and so enthusiastic a meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>He presumed the demonstration was a token of their confidence, personally and politically, and of respect for the quiet and temperate, but decided manner in which he had asserted the principles of personal and political liberty in the <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName>.--The defenders and friends of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and of rights of the <name>States</name> could hardly be heard. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/> The cry in Congress was <q>&#x0022;action, not words;&#x0022;</q> argument is exhausted; we want to know nothing of the origin and causes of our difficulties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>But a small, undaunted band of patriots determined to be heard; they attempted to call the public mind to the present condition of the country; to those principles of personal and public liberty which have existed, and will continue to exist, whether the <rs>Union</rs> lives or dies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>[Here the speaker was cheered; but it had hardly begun, when several vice-policemen made an attack with their clubs upon a citizen who proposed <q>&#x0022;<num value="3">three</num> cheers for <placeName reg="Jeff Davis, Noxubee, Mississippi" key="tgn,2420078">Jeff Davis</placeName>.&#x0022;</q> The greatest uproar prevailed for about <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure>.] He hoped that the few remarks he had to deliver would be heard in silence by his friends and his foes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>On this occasion he would not undertake to discuss the causes of the present troubles, or the manner of settlement; but he would speak of the right of the people to the safeguards of political and personal freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>He said we were living to-day under the broad shadow of a spreading military despotism.--He would repeat that he &mdash; a Senator in Congress &mdash; was living under the shadow of an irresponsible military despotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>How is it in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>[Cries of <q>&#x0022;That's so&#x0022;</q>] He exhorted all to be quiet, and then proceeded.--<placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> was a State of the <rs>Union</rs>--a coequal member of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>[Another premeditated assault was here made upon the citizens by the vice police, and a panic was created which caused a portion of the great assemblage to retire for a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>They, however, soon came back, and the rowdies and vice police, numbering in all about <num value="100">one hundred</num>, kept quiet for a while.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>This uproar don't disturb me. <rs n="Kentuckian" type="group">Kentuckians</rs> are used to such things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>I propose <q>&#x0022;<num value="3">three</num> more cheers for <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>,&#x0022;</q> for never in my life have I uttered a word or committed an act in violation of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.</q><bibl n="Mr. B"></bibl></cit> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/> After this interruption, he continued to speak of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>He said that the <name>Police</name> <rs type="role" reg="Commissioner">Commissioners</rs> of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> were imprisoned without the shadow of law, without specification, without charge, in a fort in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, and then removed beyond the limits of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> to another fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>And when the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> passed a resolution asking the <rs>President</rs> to inform the people why these arrests were made, he answered that it would be adverse to the public interests to let the people know the <name>Police</name> <rs type="role" reg="Commissioner">Commissioners</rs> of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> were thrown into prison. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/> Do you call this liberty?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>Do you call this law?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>[There were loud cries of <q>&#x0022;No!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>He was pleading their cause, not his own. It was the cause of the rich and the poor &mdash; of every man, however humble he might be, who relied upon the <rs>Constitution</rs> for his rights. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/> The rowdies continued to make a great deal of noise, and the speaker asked them what they came for but to hear him speak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>Poor fellows, said he, you are weaving the cords to bind your own limbs; your children will bless me for what I am now saying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>Poor, miserable wretches, I am acquainted with your character, and do not intend to be intimidated by you. I have said nothing inflammatory, but came here to speak to you of your rights, which are being trampled in the dust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>Then, why not listen to reason?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/> He said that he knew they were not a fair representative of the sentiment of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, or of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>Whenever they were ready to hear him, he would prove to them that every right they had under the <rs>Constitution</rs> of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> or of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> was trampled under foot by the <name>Administration</name> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>the <name>Inquisition</name> of to-day outstrips everything in the shape of usurpation which the world has ever heard of; there has been nothing to equal it since the time when mankind <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> undertook to rule the will of despots. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/> The action of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> in relation to your Police Commissioners is unequalled in the annals of outrage and despotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>He was here to contend for the eternal principles of political and personal liberty &mdash; principles which had lived before the formation of the <name>Colonies</name>; before the <rs>Union</rs> was formed, and which would survive after the <rs>Union</rs> was gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>The Union is a means, not an end; the <rs>Union</rs> was formed to secure and make eternal these principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>When the attempt to preserve these principles becomes inconsistent with the preservation of the <rs>Union</rs>, the principles will live, whatever else perish. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/> Whenever the issue arises between the preservation of the <rs>Union</rs> and the preservation of the principles of personal liberty, personal right and public liberty, the <rs>Union</rs> will have to go down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>[The speaker was here hissed by the rowdies, and another disgraceful squabble ensued.] After quiet had been restored, <persName n="Breckinridge,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00198" reg="mostcommon:Breckinridge,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Breckinridge</surname></persName> said he would give his observations to the country; he had watched these disturbances and they were invariably gotten up by men with sticks in their hands, called police. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/> If the police would let the people alone, he would be enabled to proceed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>He knew he would have met a hearty welcome in <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> if a down-trodden and oppressed people were allowed to speak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>A just <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, who rules all nations has our cause in his hands, and before him all despots must sink, cowed and appalled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>We have had a day of freedom and liberty, and may <name n="God" type="God">God</name> speed the return of it. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>The crowd lingered around the hotel for some time after, and slowly returned to their homes at a late hour. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/> The action of the vice-police throughout was most disgraceful; and they were aided by several persons holding office under the <rs>Federal Government</rs>. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>The Government was desirous of stopping the <rs>French</rs> system of coolie trade in disguise; but the only alternative was the granting of facilities for the coolie emigration which would be carried out as an experiment, under the most approved regulations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>The rain of <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> had been very heavy, and it was feared the little streams, swollen to unusual proportions, might have washed the soft soil from beneath the track in some of the gullies or ravines through which they ran.--About <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> this side the junction with the <rs type="place">Fredericksburg Road</rs>, there is an embankment through which a culvert ran, at this time filled with a swollen and turbid stream, which made large excavations in the sides as it dashed through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>This place was a point of suspicion, and the engineer at the junction telegraphed his fears to this city, and advised the train to proceed with great caution; but, unfortunately, the cars had left the station before the telegram was received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>The Superintendent immediately sent word to start out an engine with red lights, to give warning at the spot where it was supposed there was a liability of the track being washed away.--This was done at once; but before reaching the spot, the outward bound train had been precipitated over the embankment, with its freight and passengers, smashing the cars in a frightful manner, and wounding many of the unfortunate soldiers who were on board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>The result as given in our paper of yesterday was correct as far as it went, although there were many others who received some slight hurts, bruises, scratches and contusions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>A competent medical force was at once dispatched to the scene of the disaster, and every possible attention given to the wounded sufferers, who are now being cared for at the various houses in the vicinity. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>It was done, however, by our own people, to prevent its being appropriated to a far worse end than conflagration &mdash; that is, the <rs type="season">fall</rs> and <rs type="season">winter</rs> abode of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> and runaway negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>The facts, as related to me by reliable persons direct from the place, are, that <persName n="Magruder,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00312" reg="mostcommon:Magruder,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Magruder</surname></persName> (who, by-the way, has his eyes and ears in their places,) had learned definitely and satisfactorily that <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00313" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName> had issued, or was about to issue, an order that the town should be very strongly fortified, and occupied by his troops as their permanent quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>This was doubtless a part of his <q>&#x0022;plan for capturing a large number of slaves.&#x0022;</q> Our military men had made <num value="1">one</num> great mistake &mdash; though probably at that time it could not have been prevented &mdash; in allowing the invaders to occupy <orgName n="Newport News" type="newspaper">Newport News</orgName>; and now that such a disaster could be prevented, every consideration of policy and strategy demanded that it should be.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>The consequence would have been the same &mdash; the utter destruction of the town, and with it a fearful loss of life on our side as well as theirs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>As it turned out, the object of the enemy has been frustrated, and so far as we know, no life has been lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>There were very few white families there, a few faithful servants, who had done much to protect their masters' property, and a crowd of runaway negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>All those, it is believed, made their escape before the torch was applied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/><num value="1">One</num> admission, however, is made, which rather upsets the theories of the warlike journalists of the <rs>North</rs>, and that is that the defeat was not the result of a panic among the teamsters or civilians on the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>The General sticks to the false assertion that the <orgName n="Confederate Forces" type="org">Confederate forces</orgName> greatly outnumbered his own; and while he puts down his loss at a higher mark than the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have heretofore been willing to admit, he yet comes far below the truth; for our troops have buried more of the enemy than <persName n="McDowell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00339" reg="nearbymention:McDowell,Irvin,,,"><surname>McDowell</surname></persName> names.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>The report is very long, and neither possesses merit, interest or truth enough to justify its publication in our columns.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/> Whatever its demerits may be in other respects, it effectually disposes of the various <hi rend="italics">canards</hi> of the New York press in relation to the cause of the retreat of the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>It also tacitly admits that the victory was won by the <rs>Confederates</rs>, by dint of hard fighting, and not, by any means, in consequence of the cowardice of a fat <rs type="role2">Lieutenant</rs>, or of a panic among the teamsters and civilians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/><persName n="McDowell,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00340" reg="nearbymention:McDowell,Irvin,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McDowell</surname></persName> scouts the idea of the march to the battle-field being calculated to exhaust the strength of the regiments that were brought into action; and states further, that, instead of being led against the enemy without partaking of food, the troops were furnished with <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>We shall get at the truth after awhile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>The number of killed is set down in the report at <num value="19">19</num> officers and <num value="462">462</num> rank and file; but this must have been mere guess work, as it was left to the <rs>Confederates</rs> to bury the dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>He leaves it wholly to conjecture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>He simply says, that some of those who were reported missing have returned since &mdash; that some have strayed away into other regiments, which is of itself a singular admission &mdash; and that many of the <name>Zouaves</name>, who were supposed to have been taken prisoners, have been heard of in New York &mdash; which is a delicate way of acknowledging that they had deserted and gone home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>Any <num value="1">one</num> who reads carefully the report, will rise from its perusal with an impression amounting almost to a conviction that, so far as the list of casualties is concerned, it betrays a studied attempt at concealment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/> If <num value="1">one</num> were to state the rightful objects of this war to be the preservation of the capital of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and the vindication of the authority of the <rs>Union</rs> against the doctrine of State secession, no reasonable man could dissent from the proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>The vindication of that authority and the restoration of the acceded States to the <rs>Union</rs>, are <num value="1">one</num> and the same thing. ***** </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/> If there is a reasonable probability that war will do it, the means are appropriate to the end, and the end itself is a right <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>If the military subjection of the <rs>South</rs> is not probable, or if, being probable, it is not likely to be followed by a state of things which will again make such a system as the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName> a practicable Government, then the means are not appropriate to the end, and the end should be sought in some other mode. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/> With regard to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of these conditions &mdash; the probability of the military coercion of the <rs>South</rs>--opinions may differ.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>The public mind has been so poisoned with deliberate inculcation of contempt for our adversaries and their resources, that even the <rs>Government</rs> has been driven to the sacrifice of lives which the public could illy spare, and whose private loss is irreparable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>This has been done, apparently, in sheer diffusion as to the power of the enemy; for there was certainly but <num value="1">one</num> important man in office in the nation, and he the very man on whose judgment both the <rs>Government</rs> and the people should have implicitly relied, who is now known not to have shared that delusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>Whether the <rs>North</rs> can ultimately reduce the <rs>South</rs> to submission, is a military question, on which it would ill become mere civilians to express a confident opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>In all the resources of war we are the superiors; in courage and in military capacity, the inhabitants of the <num value="2">two</num> sections are probably equal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>But resources, courage and military skill are not all that are needed to over run and hold in subjection so vast a country as the seceded States, if the people of that country are united and determined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>That they have become united and determined, is apparent; and it is only encouraging a mischievous and fatal delusion to pretend the contrary. ***** </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/> In all history there has never been an instance of a free people, once participating in the voluntary administration of a free popular government, who have thrown off their connection with it, and have subsequently been forced to resume it by a military conquest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>However true, just and lawful, in theory, such a conquest may be, it is the application of means entirely unsuited to the end. In the nature of things, it must leave effects which will put the end still further off than it was before the consequence was attempted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>We need not ask if the <rs>Union</rs> will be tolerable to the <rs>South</rs> when they are thus conquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>Will it be tolerable to ourselves?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>Can we successfully and safety hold in military subjection such a portion of our common country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>Can we undertake to do it without creating a military power, in which our own liberties must be merged? </p> </div4>

<list type="ordered"> 
<head></head> 
<item n="1"> <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num> Because a state of war is not a matter between Government in their political character merely, but is a war between all individuals of <num value="1">one</num> and all the individuals of which the other nation is composed, independent of their social or business affinities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>Every loyal citizen of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> ought to, and must, regard every citizen of the <rs>Northern</rs> <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>Because the transmission of so much money from the <rs>South</rs> to the <rs>North</rs>, for the purchase and payment of these securities, will be to drain the <rs>South</rs> of so much of her material wealth, and will be allowing the avarice of Southern speculators to minister to the power and give aid and comfort to our enemies; and, </item> 
<item n="4"> <num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>Because the purchase of these securities from our enemies will not relieve them of what they profess to believe to be worthless securities, but it will relieve them of the only interests they have in the <rs>South</rs>; and once relieved of their pecuniary interests, they will become our more inveterate enemies, and our interests seem to dictate the propriety of continuing these securities in the hands of our enemies, and of keeping our money at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>However, at about <time value="10oclock">10 o'clock</time>, preceded by our fine band, we repaired to a very large field north of our camp, where we found already in position a large number of soldiers; and in about an hour, or there-abouts, the line was formed diagonally across several fields, extending several miles, and the order was given to prepare for review.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>At this juncture, our attention was attracted by quite a commotion among the large concourse of spectators who had assembled to see the sights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>They gave way to the right and left, when an open carriage, containing <num value="3">three</num> gentlemen, attended by an escort, made its appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>The entire army saluted by presenting arms, and <persName n="Longstreet,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00347" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Longstreet</surname></persName> rode up to the carriage, and, having dismounted, saluted the <rs>Prince</rs>, for it was the veritable <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>Napoleon</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>It is <num value="1">one</num> thing to look upon the pomp and pageantry of the martial array, but it is another and a very different thing to encounter it on the actual battle-field in all its ghastly hideousness; to be conscious, above all, that no matter how lavish the <name>Administration</name> may be in the expenditure of blood and treasure, and no matter what amount of success may crown its efforts, the <rs>Union</rs>, in whose name the battle is ostensibly fought, will have lost all its vital elements, and the whole theory upon which our Government was framed will have undergone a radical change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>Never was a party more certain to be battled in the end than the <num value="1">one</num> which is now in power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>Whether it wins or loses, it is equally doomed to disappointment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>If victorious, it can only hold the vanquished to their allegiance by a permanent occupation of the country; if defeated, it comes out of the contest disgraced, and also burthened with an enormous debt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>There is but <num value="1">one</num> purpose which the <name>Administration</name> can really have in view in carrying on this war, for it is the only <num value="1">one</num> by which it can hope to escape from the dilemma in which it is placed &mdash; that purpose is the complete subjugation of the acceded States, and their reduction to the condition of conquered provinces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00362" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> that this could be accomplished, what then becomes of the rights reserved to the citizens of all the <name>States</name> under the provisions of the <rs>Constitution</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>This question is now beginning to be considered by many people at the <rs>North</rs>, and the impossibility of finding for it a practical and satisfactory solution perplexes them exceedingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>Their ships are rotting at the wharves; their factories no longer resound with the hum of busy industry; their workshops are closed; their trade is ruined; many of their merchants are bankrupt, and the families of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of industrious clerks, mechanics and laborers are struggling to obtain the bare necessaries of life, and look forward to the coming winter with fear and anxiety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>These are evils which the war has already brought upon them, and for which even a dozen victories would bring no compensation, unless they could restore the old Union, and with it the old fraternal feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>Such a consummation is, however, not to be excepted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>Instead of victory, thus far, the <rs>North</rs> has met with defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>Its &#x0022;Grand Army&#x0022; has been put to utter rout, and all its baggage and stores, and munitions of war, have fallen into the hands of the conquerors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>What if this terrible blow be but the precursor of others equally severe?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>What if the sums already squandered in organizing <num value="1">one</num> army be but the prelude to a system of taxation which, if permitted to go into operation, would, in the midst of the prevailing paralysis in trade, not only involve personal sacrifices too grievous to be borne with equanimity, but would bequeath also an enormous burthen of debt to posterity?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>Such a system of direct and indirect taxation Congress now proposes to inaugurate, and under the sharp spur of <persName n="Trumbull,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00363" reg="mostcommon:Trumbull,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Trumbull</surname></persName>'s revenue bill the people of the <rs>North</rs> are beginning to speculate upon the probable cost of the war, and to ponder over its consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>The touchstone of a prospective army of tax gatherers is well calculated to quicken their perceptions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>We are not, therefore, at all surprised to learn that peace meetings have become far more frequent at the <rs>North</rs> during the past <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure>, and that the opposition to the sanguinary policy of the <name>Administration</name> is gaining numbers of adherents, even from the ranks of those who once imagined, with <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00364" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abe,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, that the secession of the <rs>Southern States</rs> was the work of politicians, and not of the great bulk of the people, and that it would be an easy matter to put down the &#x0022;armed combinations&#x0022; existing there.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/> Besides the startling measures announced by the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> for the prosecution of the war, his Message to Congress on opening this extraordinary session comprises a historical glance at the origin of the civil war, an explanation, an argument in favor of his own policy, and an announcement for the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>The historical retrospect is chiefly remarkable for the broad admission which are involved, though they are not intended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/>The express object is to show that the <name>States</name> which profess to have seceded have &#x0022;rebelled&#x0022; If any a <unclear>t</unclear> is used in the composition, it is entirely employed in the endeavor to diminish the show of numbers, power, resolution, and the unanimity amongst the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> <num value="6">Six</num> States are named as having joined the <rs>Confederacy</rs>; <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> is spoken of as if she were still balancing between secession and Union, consenting to make herself <q>&#x0022;a neat for invaders&#x0022;</q> from the seceding States.--Men who have been in the <rs>Federal Government</rs> or Legislature, or in the <rs>Federal</rs> army, and have joined the <name>Confederation</name>, are implied described as a knot of conspirators, aiming to carry off muskets belonging to the central Government, and to put a pressure upon their own individual States in order to suborn public opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/>In short, the aim of the <unclear><placeName reg="Virginia City, Madison, Montana" key="tgn,2061810">Messa</placeName></unclear> is to represent the <name>Confederation</name> as limited to a small territory, a minority of malcontents with that <sic> teritory,</sic> and a clique assembled around <persName n="David,President,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00393" reg="default:David,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>David</surname></persName> at <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, the said <rs>Richmond</rs> being mentioned as if it were still within the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.--This is by far the best part of a message which reminds us, <unclear>un c ily</unclear> of the worst compositions that have emanated from the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/>A recent occupant of the <name>Presidential</name> chair had restored something of the correctness and elevation which at <num value="1">one</num> time marked the <name>Messages</name> sent into Congress Some few <rs type="role2">Presidents</rs> before <persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00394" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> acceded to office had not been very happy in their style; but we must confess that the least felicitous of them never bordered upon the very unsatisfactory character of the document now before us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/> The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> portion is a volunteered explanation of the reasons why the <rs>Federal Government</rs> defended <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>We do not remember that <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00395" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and his friends have ever been as <unclear>a lted</unclear> by the charge against which they are now so anxiously defending themselves, and their pleading is as curious as their thus spontaneously standing in the dock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/>If they had not defended the fort, they say,<cit><q rend="inline">&#x0022;the act might have been construed by many as a part of a voluntary policy;&#x0022; while at home, it would, &#x0022;discourage the friends of the <rs>Union</rs>, embolden its adversaries, and go far to insure to the latter a recognition abroad; that, in fact, it would be our national destruction consummated.&#x0022;</q><bibl></bibl></cit> It is difficult to imagine any more exaggerated or impolitic admission than the <num value="1">one</num> we have her.--that if any portion of the <rs>Union</rs> could be <q>&#x0022;recognized&#x0022;</q> as an independent State, <q>&#x0022;our national destruction would be consummated.&#x0022;</q> So, on the strength of that fear, <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00396" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> did venture to defend <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/> The <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> and longest section of the <name>Message</name> is the pleading against the right of secession, conducted in a fashion which would not obtain much credit in any district attorney's of fice there or in the Old Riley here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>The secession of the <name>States</name> <q>&#x0022;commonly called slave States&#x0022;</q> is again mentioned as an off nee, which is begging the whole question at issue, and the same time confessing how incapable the <rs>Federal Government</rs> has shown itself of retaining any hold upon the <rs>Southern</rs> members of the late Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>Yet, as our readers are aware, the <rs>Southern States</rs> have been only too anxious to keep open a path for friendly communications with the <rs>North</rs>; while it is the <rs>Federal Government</rs> which has <unclear>b oxen</unclear> off communications, and has rendered the secession so thoroughgoing and complete as it is. <num value="1">One</num> argument upon which <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00397" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and his friends appear strongly to rely is, that the <name>States</name> never existed independently, and that, therefore, they cannot lawfully and peacefully withdraw from the <rs>Union</rs> <q>&#x0022;without the consent of the <rs>Union</rs> or of any other States.&#x0022;</q> This is an assertion directly in the teeth of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, which provides for any amendment even of the <rs>Constitution</rs> itself, on a vote taken by the <name>Legislatures</name> of the <name>States</name>; that is to say, any amendment of the <rs>Constitution</rs> would become a law if it were affirmed by a specified majority either of the <rs>State Legislatures</rs> or of a <orgName n="National Convention" type="convention">National Convention</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>Yes, <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00398" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> makes the astounding assertion that no State can withdraw from the <rs>Union</rs> if the withdrawal be vetoed by any <num value="1">one</num> State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/>Perhaps he does not mean what his words express, for we must always make allowances on the score of his manifest inexperience and inaptitude in wielding the pen </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/> The argument, however, against the independence of the <name>States</name>, in any period of their political growth, is carried to the pitch of the sublime and the proverbial trifle beyond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>If <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00399" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> had read the history of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to himself he would know better than to put on record this indecorous essay for the ridiculous posterity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/> The personal idiosyncrasy of <q>&#x0022;the <rs>Executive</rs>.&#x0022;</q> as the <rs>President</rs> calls himself, comes out fully in the concluding and shortest section of the <name>Message</name>, where he professes to announce what is to be the course of the <rs>Government</rs> after its victory in the present civil war. If there is to be coercion and conquest or subjugation, he does not <q>&#x0022;perceive&#x0022;</q> that there is to be any such thing <q>&#x0022;in any just sense of these terms&#x0022;</q> * * * </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/> It is, indeed, impossible to follow the <name>Presidential</name> bungling through all its intricacies for while <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00400" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> is uttering for each State this broad and unqualified right of dictation, he allows that <q>&#x0022;the people themselves, and not their servants, can safely reverse their own deliberate decision,&#x0022;</q> which is precisely what the seceding States proclaim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>If it is <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00401" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s purpose to mitigate the mistrust and hostility which his Administration has raised in the <rs>Southern States</rs> by explaining what course he should pursue after the conclusion of a peace, he has most ludicrously failed to carry out his own purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>On the contrary, he has just alluded to the <unclear> ur j e</unclear> sufficiently to show a consciousness that satisfaction ought to be given to the public on both sides of the <rs>Potomac</rs>, while irritating at least the <rs>Southern States</rs> by withholding the information which he promises. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/> We can imagine <num value="1">one</num> reason for this reverse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>From a latent sense that it is at discord with the majority in the <rs>Northern</rs> as well as the <rs>Southern States</rs>, <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00402" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s party has done its best to suppress the friendly overtures of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>, and now it is endeavoring to conceal from the leading men in the <rs>South</rs> the growing disposition in the <rs>Northern States</rs> to re- open the question of peaceful negotiations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/>Hence, undoubtedly, he astoundingly vague and prevaricating language which he employs, at the very time that he professed to alleviate the uneasiness in the mind of candid men, by intimating what is to be the course of Government towards the <rs>Southern States</rs> after the conclusion of the war.
