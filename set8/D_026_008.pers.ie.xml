<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>He doubted whether the gentleman could frame a bill which in all its details would be acceptable even to himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>He thought it due to the <orgName n="Military Committee" type="committee">Military Committee</orgName> that this bill should be taken up and perfected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>It was rejected in the <rs type="place">House</rs> by a decisive vote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Let us earnestly hope that this bill may share the same fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>He had voted against the proposition then, and there was nothing in the condition of the country, or in the reasoning of the honorable gentleman from <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">So. Carolina</placeName>, (<persName n="Miles,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:Miles,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Miles</surname></persName>,) that would induce him to change the opinion then entertained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>He (<persName n="Staples,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Staples,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Staples</surname></persName>) argued at considerable length to show that the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> could not perform the duties this bill would impose upon him; that he (the <rs>Secretary</rs>) would be compelled to delegate the power to innumerable boards and agents, dispersed throughout the country; that these boards would open new sources of patronage and power; that they would be exposed to all the temptations of personal, political, and family influence, to fraud, corruption, and bribery &mdash; creating, by their decisions, dissatisfaction among the people and discontent in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>He insisted that the expense of an universal conscription would be enormous; that no man could estimate the injury inflicted upon all the industrial interests of the country by the sudden stoppage of so many callings and pursuits until the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> shall determine who shall be detailed, and for what purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The honorable gentleman from <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> says that Congress cannot agree upon a bill &mdash; that the <orgName n="Military Committee" type="committee">Military Committee</orgName> cannot agree upon a bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The gentleman is mistaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>It may require time, but an actual vote will always test the sense of the <rs type="place">House</rs> upon any proposition for exemption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The same process of reasoning would lead us to commit to the <rs>President</rs> the whole subject of taxation and currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Upon that question there are wider differences of opinion than any other in the whole range of political economy &mdash; differences as to principle and differences as to detail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>When the rebellion began we, too, counted upon internal discussions and divisions among the rebels; but they soon put an end to that by the unanimity with which they re-elected <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00077" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName n="Jefferson">Jeff.</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>That is the reason why we press the subject so urgently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>It is quite time that this war were over, and the shortest way to end it is to show the rebels that we consider everything else <sic>subsidary</sic> to it by unanimously electing a President whom the rebel leaders will fear and the misguided Southern people respect. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>The despots and aristocrats of the Old World would see that when the safety of the <rs>Republic</rs> demands it every <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> is willing to give up all to his country; and when a nation is thus united it is as irresistible as a Macedon phalanx, and can make its own terms with the world. --Then there would no longer be any expression of foreign sympathy with the rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>The <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> powers would have quire enough to do to attend to their own subjects, whose latest democratic feelings would be stirred to fever heat by this glorious exhibition of the majesty of a free people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>That is another reason why we desire the unanimous election of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00079" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>Never could a nation's immortality be purchased so cheaply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>The people are already willing and anxious to accomplish it. Only the politicians obstruct the way, and we appeal to them to stand aside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>If our appeal be successful they will deserve and receive public gratitude and ample reward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>If it be unsuccessful we shall then know with whom we have to deal and how to deal with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>We have spoken frankly and fairly, and in a most unselfish and patriotic spirit, but we do not forget, and beg all concerned to remember &mdash; that we are in a position to dictate as well as to request, and that we have the power to sweep out of our path those who will not listen to reason, and who obstinately refuse to mover. </p> </div3>

<head>The Situation.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/> It is painful to observe that a certain degree of despondency, whether derived from the tone of Congress or the <name>Jeremiads</name> of the press, is stealing over our people, especially here in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are building the largest expectations upon it.--What is there in the present aspect of affairs, more than there has been from the opening of the war, to make us despond?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>What are we suffering now which we ought not to have anticipated, and which, indeed, we did not anticipate?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>We are engaged in a long, tedious, desperate war. Did we not know from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, at least did not everybody foresee, except a few gentlemen claiming to be wiser than all the rest of the world, that the war would be long, desperate, and tedious?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>We have had losses, and they neither small nor few in number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>But no body who ever heard of a war before supposed we were to go through this war without sustaining any loss whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>Nobody believed that we were to be always successful, or that the struggle was to be ended by <hi rend="italics">a coup de main,</hi> like the siege of a fortress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>We are somewhat straitened for provisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>Who, among us all, ever expected that it would be otherwise in the course of the war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>When we entered upon it, we took all its chances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>Defeat, massacre, pestilence, famine &mdash; everything that smacks of disaster' except submission &mdash; we knew to be within the range of possibility, and the consideration did not deter us a moment from the course we had determined to pursue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>We embraced them all without hesitation, as the only alternative left, unless we chose to submit to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> without a struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>Should they all descend upon us in their turn, or at once, we were prepared to stand the brunt of their combined assault, for we knew that by holding out to the end we must triumph, and that not to triumph was to be ruined, root and branch, body and soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>Well, we have held out for <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> against the most tremendous power ever exerted against any <num value="1">one</num> nation since the world was made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>The enterprise of <persName><foreName>Darius</foreName></persName> against <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName> was a mere incursion of <rs n="Choctaw" type="nativeamerican">Choctaws</rs> or Potawatamies compared to it, for that enterprise was defeated by the repulse at <placeName key="tgn,2070420" n="1.000 3" reg="marathon, cortland, new york">Marathon</placeName>, in which only <num value="11000">11,000</num> <rs n="Athenian" type="ethnic">Athenians</rs> were engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>The invasion of <persName n="Xerxes,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00149" reg="mostcommon:Xerxes,nomatch:0"><surname>Xerxes</surname></persName> was nothing compared to it, for his whole force of <num value="5000000">five millions</num> was discomfited, ruined, almost exterminated by <num value="2">two</num> battles--<num value="1">one</num> at sea and the other on land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>The invasions of <placeName key="tgn,7016786" n="1.000 94" reg="prussia">Prussia</placeName>, during the time of the great <rs>Frederick</rs>, were nothing to it; for, although the invading nations together counted <num value="100000000">one hundred millions</num> of souls, they never had more than <num value="200000">two hundred thousand</num> men engaged at any <num value="1">one</num> time in the invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>The invasion of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> by the allies was nothing to it, for they did not carry half a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men to <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> when that capital was treacherously delivered up to them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/> But these States of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, numbering only as many white inhabitants as <placeName key="tgn,7016786" n="1.000 94" reg="prussia">Prussia</placeName> numbered under <persName><foreName>Frederick</foreName></persName>, have resisted, and resisted successfully, for nearly <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, the utmost efforts of armies that at <num value="1">one</num> time counted <num value="1100">eleven hundred</num> <num value="1000">thousand</num> men in their ranks, and have never, for <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> at least, counted at any <num value="1">one</num> time less than half that number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>These men, it must be remembered, were not effeminate Asiatics, or rude barbarians, like the hordes of <persName n="Xerxes,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00150" reg="mostcommon:Xerxes,nomatch:0"><surname>Xerxes</surname></persName>, but civilized men, trained in the <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> fashion, furnished with the best weapons, provided with everything to make the soldier's life comfortable, having all the world for their armory and their storehouses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>For <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> shut out from all commerce with mankind, with no resources but such as we have ourselves created, badly armed, badly clothed, badly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/> Ignored by the whole world, outnumbered by <num value="3">three</num> to <num value="1">one</num>, we have resisted a resisted successfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>And shall we be told now &mdash; now that our strength is still unbroken, and the hearts of our soldiers are still as high as ever, when those brave men still stand between us and the subjugation that certainly awaits us if we falter, shall we now be told that the time has come when we are to fold our arms in despair?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>Who are they that use such language at such an hour?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>Not the soldiers of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00151" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, or of <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00152" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, or <persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00153" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>, or of <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00154" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>Not those brave men, who have become so accustomed to danger that they barely think of it when it is present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>Who are the croakers of the land?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>Not the farmers, or the people generally in the country, for they are, in general, with a few shameful exceptions, hopeful and resolute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>Who are they?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>Not the women, for their spirits are too masculine to give way when the storm rises highest.--They are the denizens of the towns, the money makers &mdash; the men who fear that further resistance may be the means of cutting off all their profits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>They it is who hope that if the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> come they will not treat them so badly as some seem to anticipate. --That they will not use them quite so harshly as they have used the people of New Orleans and <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>That they will not plunder them entirely of the money they have made out of the miseries of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>These are the croakers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>You can tell them at a <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> distance when you meet them in the street. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/> For our own part, we do not believe that our cause has ever been in such a promising condition since the commencement of the war. We have, temporarily, lost much territory, it is true &mdash; that was to have been expected from the moment it was determined to throw away all the fruits of our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> great victory at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, and to rely for our preservation solely upon a defensive war. It was to have been expected, we repeat, that an enemy outnumbering us so greatly would seize and occupy much of our territory; but expecting thus much it was not to be accepted as a sign of ultimate triumph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>In the meantime the proportions of the war have been greatly reduced, and the enemy cannot reinforce <num value="1">one</num> army without robbing another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>Congress have it in their power to put into the field an army fully equal in numbers to that of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>Indeed, if the struggles who are scattered all over the country can be brought back to their colors, we feel assured that we have already a force quite equal to the task of repelling any enterprise that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> may undertake, let its scale be as gigantic as it may. Straggling, we are prone to Believe, is the result of lax-discipline, and discipline is to be expected only from good officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>Let all those regimental and company officers from whose ranks the large bodies of men are straggling, be rendered more strictly responsible in future &mdash; let the penalty be reduction to the ranks, or some other of proportionate severity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>Let Congress busy themselves with the discipline of the army, and stop hunting down the poor devils of <unclear> </unclear> who are shivering and starving on <measure n="1500dollars" type="currency">$1,500</measure> a year, <persName n="Memminger,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00155" reg="mostcommon:Memminger,nomatch:0"><surname>Memminger</surname></persName> currency, and go calmly to work, not act as if they were frightened out of their lives, and things will assume a brighter aspect, even to their over-excited <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> imaginations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>As it is they are hunting sparrow hawks while the eagle is abroad; chasing mice while the lion is in the field.--As for subjugation, we will think of that hereafter.
