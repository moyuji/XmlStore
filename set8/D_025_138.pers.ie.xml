<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>The crisis which threatened to divide the friends of the <rs>Union</rs> is past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>Looking now to the present and future, and with a reference to a resumption of the national authority in the <name>States</name> wherein that authority has been suspended, I have thought it proper to issue a proclamation, a copy of which is herewith transmitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>On examination of this proclamation it will appear (as is believed) that nothing is attempted beyond what is amply justified by the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>True, the form of an oath is given, but no man is coerced to take it. The man is only promised a pardon in case he voluntarily takes the oath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>The Constitution authorizes the <rs>Executive</rs> to grant or withhold the pardon at his <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> own absolute discretion, and this includes the power to grant on terms, as is fully established by judicial and other authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>It is also proffered that if in any of the <name>States</name> named a State government shall be recognized and guaranteed by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, under it the <rs>State</rs> shall, on the constitutional conditions, be protected against invasion and domestic violence. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>But why tender the benefits of this provision only to a State Government set up in this particular way?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>This section of the <rs>Constitution</rs> contemplates a case wherein the element within a State favorable to a <rs n="Republican" type="political">republican</rs> government in the <rs>Union</rs> may be too feeble for an opposite and hostile element, external to, or even within, the <rs>State</rs>, and such are precisely the cases with which we are now dealing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>An attempt to guarantee and protect a revived State Government, constructed in whole or in preponderating part from the very element against whose hostility and violence it is to be protected, is simply absurd.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>There must be a test by which to separate the opposing elements so as to build only from the sound; and that test is a sufficiently liberal <num value="1">one</num> which accepts as sound whoever will make as worn recantation of his former movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/> Those laws and proclamations were enacted and put forth for the purpose of aiding in the suppression of the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>To give them their fullest effect there had to be a pledge for their maintenance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>I may add, at this point, while I remain in my present position I shall not attempt to retract or modify the emancipation proclamation, nor shall I return to slavery any person who is free by the terms of that proclamation or by any of the acts of Congress.--For these and other reasons it is thought best that support of these measures shall be included in the oath; and it is believed that the <rs>Executive</rs> may lawfully claim it in return for pardon and restoration of forfeited rights, which he has a clear constitutional power to withhold altogether or grant upon the terms he shall deem wisest for the public interest.

<head>The revolution in the labor system.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>The proposed acquiescence of the national Executive in any reasonable temporary State arrangement for the freed people is made with the view of possibly modifying the confusion and destitution which must at best attend all classes by a total revolution of labor throughout whole States.--It is hoped that the already deeply afflicted people in those States may be somewhat more ready to give up the cause of their affliction, if to this extent this vital matter be left to themselves, while no power of the national Executive to prevent an abuse is abridged by the proposition. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>The suggestion in the proclamation as to maintaining the political framework of the <name>States</name>, on what is called reconstruction, is made in the hope that it may do good without danger of harm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>It will save labor and avoid great confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>But why any proclamation now upon this subject? --The subject is beset with the conflicting views that the step might be delayed too long, or be taken too soon. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/> In some States the elements for resumption seem ready for action, but remain inactive, apparently for want of a rallying point &mdash; a plan of action.--Why should A adopt the plan of B, rather than B that of A?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>By the proclamation a plan is presented which may be accepted by them as a rallying point, and which they are assured in advance will not be regretted here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>This may bring them to act sooner than they otherwise would. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>The objection to a premature presentation of a plan by the <rs>National Executive</rs> consists in the danger of committal on points which could be more safely left to further developments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>Care has been taken to shape the movement as to avoid embarrassment from this source, saying that on certain terms certain classes will be pardoned, with rights restored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>It is not said that other classes or other terms will never be included, saying that reconstruction will be accepted if presented in a specific way.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>It provides that the term of office of the above named officers be the same as that of a member of the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>, and expire at the end of each session of Congress, but that the same officer or person may be renominated or appointed for a number of terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>We have rarely had the fortune to come across a more objectionable proposition. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/> <persName n="Johnson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00158" reg="mostcommon:Johnson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName> said, on submitting this bill, that its constitutionality was beyond question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>We doubt it exceedingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>The Constitution divides the <rs>Government</rs> into <num value="3">three</num> grand departments &mdash; Legislative, Judicial, and Executive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>It confers upon each certain powers, necessary to the discharge of their several functions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>It gives to the <rs>Executive</rs> the power of appointing the heads of departments, with the advice and consent of the <name>Senate</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>When thus appointed the <rs>Secretary</rs> holds his office at the will of the <rs>President</rs>, unless he be impeached and removed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>To alter that tenure is to violate the <rs>Constitution</rs> in its spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>If it be desirable to alter it, why not begin by a resolution to amend the <rs>Constitution</rs> ? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/> We hold that our Government is already sufficiently democratic, and that any step in the direction of a more platitudinous democracy is a step to anarchy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>The framers of the <rs>Constitution</rs> meant the <rs>Executive</rs> to be permanent, and for that purpose limited the <rs>President</rs> to a single term.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>It is right that, during that term, he should have such constitutional advisers around him as he may select, without subjecting them every <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> to the ordeal of a Senatorial vote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>We can conceive of no scheme better calculated to generate and keep alive the spirit of faction, always baneful in a republic, and very often fatal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/><hi rend="italics">Stability</hi> is what that form of government is most apt to want, and we cannot conceive of a plan better adapted to aggravate that want than the <num value="1">one</num> in question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>A Secretary must be a very extraordinary person if, in the course of <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>, he give not offence to some <num value="1">one</num> <rs type="role2">Senator</rs>, and the <rs>Senator</rs> must be more than usually forgiving in temper if he take not occasion to show it at the end of every <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>.--Here, then, is an end of all the legitimate duties of legislation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>Congress will meet but to wrangle and dispute &mdash; we shall have the old <orgName n="U. S. Congress" type="Congress">U. S. Congress</orgName>, <hi rend="italics">minue</hi> the nigger, reenacted on a new theatre, --the main object of every member will be to get rid of some obnoxious head of department, and the pursuit of that object will leave him no time to think of the public business. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/> The analogy which has been imagined between our own Government and that of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, in this respect, does not exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>In <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> the <rs>Queen</rs> reigns, the <name>Ministry</name> governs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>When the <orgName n="House of Commons" type="government">House of Commons</orgName> vote a want of confidence, the <name>Ministry</name> dissolve the <name>Parliament</name> and order a new election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>If the people support the <name>Ministerial</name> candidates, it is taken as a proof that their conduct is approved by them, and they hold on. If the <name>Ministry</name> are beaten at the polls they resign, because it is a proof that they are not supported by the people, a new Ministry is called in by the sovereign, and it is understood that their measures are to be such as are indicated by the late popular vote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>Here, the <rs>President</rs>, and the lower <orgName n="House" type="government">House</orgName>, are elected by the same constituency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> <hi rend="italics">governs</hi> in the same sense that the <name>Ministry</name> governs in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>The Cabinet are but so many clerks, who can only advise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>It was so in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>--it is so here &mdash; under this Constitution it always will be so. A censure directed against a Cabinet officer is, therefore, clearly, we conceive, directed against the <rs>President</rs>, who is responsible for his conduct.--Whether the people approve of such a course cannot be known, for there are no means of dissolving Congress, and ordering a new election; while, in the meantime, if the lower <orgName n="House" type="government">House</orgName> represent the people, so does the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>There is, it is true, a provision which interposes the electors between the people and the <rs>President</rs>; but it is the veriest of all fictions, as was shown more than once in the old Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>When, therefore, the <name>Senate</name>, an autocratic body, elected for <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure>, and not by the people, pass a vote of want of confidence in a Cabinet, or a part of it, it does an act no way analogous to that which the <name>Commons</name> of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> perform when they vote want of confidence in a Ministry, with the view of bringing their measures to the ordeal of a popular vote. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/> It is very clear to us, however it may be intended, that this measure is calculated to bring the officers of the <rs>Cabinet</rs> under the direct control of the <name>Senate</name> &mdash; to make the <name>Senate</name>, in fact, their masters &mdash; and thereby seriously to impair the usefulness of the <rs>Executive</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>Now, we deprecate the interference of <num value="1">one</num> branch of the <rs>Government</rs> with the <hi rend="italics">prescribed</hi> duties of another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>It is calculated to overthrow all good government in the end. In the present temper of the body in question, we should look for the most serious evils as the natural result of such legislation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/> Should this bill pass into a law, it will revolutionize the <rs>Government</rs>, and overthrow the theory and practice of the <rs>Constitution</rs> to its very foundation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>It will make the <name>Senate</name> &mdash; a body elected for <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure>, and not by a vote of the people &mdash; the actual Executive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>The Legislative and Executive authority will no longer be separated &mdash; the former will be shared with the <rs type="place">House</rs>, and the latter will remain entire with the <name>Senate</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>Neither the framers of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, nor the people who elected them, ever contemplated such a catastrophe to our experiment of self-government, and we should be very much surprised to learn that the latter were pleased with its occurrence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>It is difficult to foresee any limit to the evils which must naturally result, and which, with very little exercise of the imagination, it is easy to anticipate. </p> </div3>
