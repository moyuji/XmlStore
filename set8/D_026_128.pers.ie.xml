<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> At an early hour this morning it was ascertained that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Gen,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> had withdrawn his army under cover of darkness last night to the north bank of the <rs>North Anna</rs>, and was moving down the east side of that river in the direction of <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>As intimated in a former letter, <persName n="Lee,,Gen,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="default:Lee,Gen,,,"><foreName>Gen</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s lines extended along the range of hills on the south side of the <rs>North Anna</rs>, except on his flanks, where they took such a direction as to protect his position against any attempt that might be made against either wing of his army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>This disposition of his forces left <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Gen,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> room to throw the greater part of his own army across to the south bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The latter had exacted formidable works in his front a short distance from the river, and behind which his troops could rally in case of disaster, and at least hold us in check until they could regain the north bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>These works he has now abandoned, whether because he found the <rs>Confederate</rs> position too strong to encourage any hope be might indulge of being able to carry it by storm, or because they had accomplished the object of their construction in holding us at <placeName reg="Hanover, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2112147">Hanover Junction</placeName> until he could establish his base at <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName>, and put his army well in motion for the lower <rs>Pamunkey</rs>, it is impossible yet to say. I only know it is a cause of universal regret in the army that he did not attack us in our late position, which was stronger and better in every respect than that at the <rs>Wilderness</rs> or <rs>Spotsylvania</rs> C H. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> Unfortunately for the <rs>Confederates</rs> the late battles have taught Grent a wholesome lesson.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>For the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> after crossing the <rs>Rapidan</rs> he evinced a disposition to fight us wherever he met us. Since the <dateStruct value="--18"><day reg="18">18th instant</day></dateStruct>, however, the day on which he made his last effort to bring his dispirited troops up to the bloody work, he has shown quite as strong a desire to avoid battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>That he has found it necessary to change his whole plan of operations there can be but little doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>If it had been a part of his original design to make <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> or the lower <rs>James</rs> his base of operations, then he has committed a great blunder in marching across the country from <placeName reg="Culpeper, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2111394">Culpeper</placeName> at a cost of <num value="40">forty</num> or <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> men, when by following <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00030" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s route he could have reached the same destination without the loss of a single men.--Grent is a hard headed man, however, as well as a hard fighter, and, like most hard headed men, he has come very near having his head broken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>It remains in be seen whether he will make a demonstration towards crossing the <rs>Pamunkey</rs> at <placeName reg="Hanover Court House">Hanover Court House</placeName>, or will move up to the <rs>Chickahominy</rs> or form a junction with <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00031" reg="nearbymention:Butler,Gen,,,"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>, and seek to throw himself on the south side of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> across our lines of communication, as he did at <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/> It only remains to be added that <persName n="Lee,,Gen,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00032" reg="default:Lee,Gen,,,"><foreName>Gen</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> has made such a disposition of his own forces as to completely checkmate this last move of the enemy. </p> <closer> <signed>Sallust.</signed> </closer> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/> You have already been advised of the movement of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00033" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Gen,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> down the east bank of the <placeName key="tgn,7017624" n="1.000 27" reg="pamunkey, virginia, united states">Pamunkey</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>This change of front made it necessary for <persName n="Lee,,Gen,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="default:Lee,Gen,,,"><foreName>Gen</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> to abandon his very strong position behind the <rs>North Anna</rs>, and to march down the south side of the <rs>Pamunkey</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Grent had <measure n="12hours" type="date">twelve hours</measure> the start of him, however, having taken advantage of the darkness on the night of the <num value="26" type="ordinal">26th</num> and put his whole army in motion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>He had the advantage also of a shorter and more direct road to <placeName reg="Hanover Town">Hanover Town</placeName> and <placeName reg="New Castle, Craig, Virginia" key="tgn,2113212">New Castle</placeName>, the points at which he has thrown a considerable force across the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>It is not known whether his entire army has crossed to the south bank, but the cavalry report <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 2">two corps</orgName> at lost, and probably more, on this side, nor is it known how far he has advanced out from the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>But whatever his position, or plans, or numbers, it is believed that he has been completely checkmated by <persName n="Lee,,Gen,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00035" reg="default:Lee,Gen,,,"><foreName>Gen</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s last move upon the military chessboard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>It would be obviously improper to be more particular, but I may venture to say that the army, including officers and men, was never more satisfied with the situation, never more resolute, and never more confident of success. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/> But will <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00036" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Gen,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> move against <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> by the route taken by <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00037" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Can he expect, after his experience at <placeName reg="Spotsylvania Court House">Spotsylvania Court House</placeName>, to be able to cross the <rs>Chickahominy</rs> and carry the works by which the capital is defended?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>Prisoners say he has promised his men that he will not require them to attack Confederate breastworks any more, nor will he expect them hereafter to do any but the most necessary work on the <name>Sabbath</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>If this be true then he will find it necessary to attack <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> from some other point than the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>What route will he take?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Will be move upon <persName n="Atlee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00038" reg="mostcommon:Atlee,nomatch:0"><surname>Atlee</surname></persName>'s station, on the <orgName n="Virginia Central Railroad" type="railroad">Virginia Central railway</orgName>, as some imagined or will be march over the crimson fields of <placeName reg="Mechanicsville, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2112976">Mechanicsville</placeName>, <placeName reg="Twymans Mill, Madison, Virginia" key="tgn,2114675">Gaines's mill</placeName>, and <placeName><persName n="Fraser,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00039" reg="mostcommon:Fraser,nomatch:0"><surname>Fraser</surname></persName>'s farm</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>or will he try to reach the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>, form a junction with <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00040" reg="nearbymention:Butler,Gen,,,"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>, and then throw his whole army across the <rs>Richmond</rs> and <rs>Petersburg</rs> and the <rs>Richmond</rs> and <rs>Danville</rs> railroads, and thus cut our communications with the more Southern States?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>This last plan would be in accordance with the movement by which he enveloped <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, and destroyed all hope of the ear. <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00041" reg="nearbymention:Butler,Gen,,,"><surname>Butler</surname></persName> is already firmly fixed on the narrow neck of land at <placeName reg="Bermuda Hundreds">Bermuda Hundreds</placeName>, his flanks and rear protected by the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James</placeName> and <placeName reg="Appomattox, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1121283">Appomattox rivers</placeName>, and his front by a formidable line of entrenchments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Should <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00042" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Gen,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> once succeed in forming a junction with him, and especially in transferring his army to the south side of the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>, he might take position behind the <rs>Appomattox</rs>, occupy <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, and cut the only <num value="2">two</num> railroad lines by which our supplies are drawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>I say he might do this &mdash; It should be added, <hi rend="italics">provided</hi> he did not have <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00043" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Gen,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> and <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00044" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> to contend with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>With these masters of the art of war before him, he will find it, let us hope, an impossible undertaking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>But that he has some such scheme in his daring brain is not at all improbable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/> I rode along the lines to-day, and found the men resting after their many marches and hard battles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>Some were reading their well thumbed Bibles; some were indicting letters to the loved ones at home, to assure them of their safety; some were sleeping &mdash; perchance dreaming of the bloody work still remaining to be done; others were enjoying the music of the brigade bands, as they rehearsed those solemn and touching airs which the grand old masters of the art divine, in their most holy and impassioned moods, have given to the world; and others again were sitting under the tress, with their arms stacked near at hand, listening to the <name>Word</name> of Life, as preached by those faithful servants of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, the hardy, jealous, self-denying chaplains of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>As the army thus rested &mdash; its great heart quiet, its huge arms unstrung, its fleet feet still &mdash; I could but reflect, and wonder as I reflected, that this vast machine, this mighty giant, this great, unmeasured, and immeasurable power, should be so terrible in battle, and yet so calm and gentle and devout in the hour of peace. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/> It has been unusually quiet to day; not a gun has been fired along the lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>Nor is it probable that there will be a battle very soon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Yesterday evening there was a severe engagement between portions of <placeName reg="Hampton, Hampton, Virginia" key="tgn,7013687">Hampton</placeName>'s and <persName n="Lee,,Fitzhugh,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00045" reg="default:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><foreName>Fitzhugh</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s <orgName n="cavalry">cavalry</orgName> commands and the <rs>Federal</rs> cavalry, but I am not informed of the details, and shall not attempt to go into details.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>And, although our position is well known, as demanding only to be let alone, yet it seems to me that for the sake of humanity, without having any week of improper motives attributed to us, we might, with propriety, constantly tender negotiations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>The contents of the letter are substantially the same as those of the latter addressed by you to <persName n="Dortch,Senator,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00162" reg="mostcommon:Dortch,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Dortch</surname></persName>, extracts of which were by him read to me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>I fell persuaded you would appreciate the difficulties as soon as your attention was called to the necessity of considering the subject in detail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>As you have made no suggestions touching the manner of overcoming the obstacles, I inter that you were not apprised by <persName n="Dortch,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00164" reg="mostcommon:Dortch,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr</roleName> <surname>Dortch</surname></persName> of my remarks to him. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/> Apart from insuperable objections to the line of policy you propose, (and to which I will presently advert) I cannot see how the more material obstacles are to be surmounted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>We have made <num value="3">three</num> distinct efforts to communicate with the authorities at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and have been invariably unsuccessful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>Commissioners were sent before hostilities were begun, and the <rs>Washington Government</rs> refused to receive them or hear what they had to say.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>No answer has ever been received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>The <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> time, a few months ago, a gentleman was sent, whose position, character, and reputation were such as to ensure his reception, if the enemy were not determined to receive no proposals whatever from the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>The enemy refused so let him pass through their lines or to hold any conference with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>He was stopped before he ever reached <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName> on his way to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/> No true citizen, no man who has our cause at heart, can <unclear></unclear> this, and the good people of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> would be the last to approve of such an attempt, if aware of all the facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>So far from removing &#x0022;<unclear></unclear> of discontent,&#x0022; such a course would receive, as it would <unclear></unclear> the condemnation of those <unclear></unclear> patriots who have given their blood and their treasure to maintain the freedom, equality, and independence which <unclear></unclear> to them from the immortal forces of <placeName key="possibilities=15" n="1.000 10" reg=",">King's Mountain</placeName> <milestone unit="column" n="6"/> and other battle field of the <rs>Resolution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>If, then these proposals cannot be made through coveys, because the enemy would not receive them, how is it possible to communicate our desire for peace otherwise than by the public announcements contained to <unclear></unclear> every <unclear></unclear> seat to Congress? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/> I cannot <unclear></unclear> at this time <num value="1">one</num> instance in which I have <unclear></unclear> to announce that our <unclear></unclear> desire was peace, and the only terms which formed a <unclear></unclear> were <unclear></unclear> that you suggested, namely, &#x0022;a <unclear></unclear> only to be let alone.&#x0022; But suppose it were practicable to obtain a conference through commissioners with the <rs>Government</rs> of <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00169" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, is it at this moment that we are to consider <unclear></unclear> or even at all <unclear></unclear> Have we act just been apprised by that despot that we can only expect his <unclear></unclear> pardon by emancipating all our slaves swearing allegiance and obedience to him and his proclamation, and becoming in point of fact the slaves, of our own negroes &mdash; Can there be in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> <num value="1">one</num> citizen so fallen beneath the <unclear>dig</unclear> of his ancestors as to accept, or to enter into conference on the basis of these terms?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>That there are a few traitors in the <rs>State</rs> who would be willing to betray their <unclear></unclear> citizens to such a degraded condition, in hope of being rewarded for treachery by an escape from the common doom, may be <unclear></unclear> But I do not believe that the vilest wretch would accept such terms for himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>I cannot conceive how the people of your State, than which none has sent nobler or more gallant soldiers to the field of battle, (<num value="1">one</num> of whom it is your honor to be,) can have been deceived by anything to which you refer in &#x0022;the recants action of the <rs type="place">Federal House</rs> of Representatives&#x0022; I have seen no action of that <persName n="House,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00170" reg="mostcommon:House,nomatch:0"><surname>House</surname></persName> that does not indicate by a very decided majority the purpose of the enemy to refuse all terms of the <rs>South</rs>, except absolute, unconditional subjugation or extermination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>But if it were otherwise, how are we to treat with the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>It is with <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00171" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> alone that we ever could confer, and his own partisans at the <rs>North</rs> avow unequivocally that his purpose in his message and proclamation was to shut out all hope that he could ever treat with us on any terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>If we will break up our Government, dissolve the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, disband our armies, emancipate our slaves, take an oath of allegiance, binding ourselves to obedience to him, and of disloyalty to our own States, he proposes to pardon us and not to plunder us of anything more than the property already stolen from us, and such slaves as still remain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>In order to render his proposal so insulting as to secure their rejection, he joins to them a promise to support with his army <num value="1">one</num> <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> of the people of any State who will attempt to set up a government over the other nineteenths, thus seeking to sow discord and suspicion among the people of the several States, and to excite them to civil war in furtherance of his ends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>I know well it would be impossible to get your people, if they possessed full knowledge of these facts, to consent that proposals should now be made by us to those who control the <rs>Government</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>Your own well-known devotion to the great cause of liberty and independence, to which we have all committed whatever we have of earthly possessions, would induce you to take the lead in repelling the hero thought of abject submission to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>Yet peace on other terms is now impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>To obtain the sole terms to which you or I could listen, this struggle must continue until the enemy is beaten out of his vain confidence is our subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>Then, and not till then, will it be possible to treat of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>Till then all tender of terms to the enemy will be received as proof that we are ready for submission, and will encourage him in the atrocious warfare which he is waging. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/> I fear much from the tenor of the news I receive from <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> that an attempt will be made by some bad men to inaugurate movements which must be considered as equivalent to aid and comfort to the enemy, and which all patriots should combine to put down at any coat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>You may count on my aid in every effort to spare your State the scenes of civil warfare which will devastate its homes if the designs of these traitors be suffered to make headway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>I know that you will plans yourself in your legitimate position in the lead of those who will not suffer the name of the <orgName n="Old North State" type="newspaper">Old North State</orgName> to be blackened by such a stain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>Will you pardon me for suggesting that my only source of disquietude on the subject arises from the fear that you will delay too long be action which now appears inevitable, and that by an over earnest derive to reclaim by conciliation men whom you believe to be sound at heart, but whose loyalty is more than suspected elsewhere, you will permit them to gather such strength as to require more violent measures than are now needed?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>With your influence and position the promoters of the unfounded discontent, now prevalent in your State, would be put down without the use of physical forces if you would abandon a policy of conciliation, and set them at defiance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>In this course, frankly and firmly pursued you would rally around you all that is best and noblest in your State, and your triumph would be <unclear></unclear> If the contrary policy be adopted, I much fear you will be driven to the use of force to repress treason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>In either event, however, be assured that you will have my cordial concurrence and assistance in maintaining with you the honor, dignity and fair name of your State, and in your efforts to crush treason, whether <unclear></unclear> as I believe it now to be, or more matured, as I believe, if not firmly met, it will in our future inevitably become. </p> <closer> <salute>I have the honor to be,<lb/>Very respectfully, yours,</salute> <lb/> <signed><persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00172" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName>  <surname>Davis</surname></persName></signed> <lb/> His <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs> E B <persName n="Vance,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00173" reg="mostcommon:Vance,nomatch:0"><surname>Vance</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Governor">Governor</rs> of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, <placeName reg="Raleigh, Wake, North Carolina" key="tgn,7013949">Raleigh</placeName>, N C. </closer> </div4> </div3>
