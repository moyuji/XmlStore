<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> S. said we had all been shocked in the past few days by scenes in connection with slave catchers from adjoining neighborhoods attempting to carry off human beings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>He referred to the fact that commissioners here had in the last few hour determined that cross-examination was not to be allowed in the great matter of human freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>He held that as neither the act of Congress of <dateStruct value="1798--"><year reg="1798">1798</year></dateStruct> nor that of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct> said a word about the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName> or any Territory, but spoke solely of delivering fugitives escaping from <num value="1">one</num> State into another State, they did not, therefore, apply to the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>His lessons at the bar had taught him that law was always to be construed in favor of liberty and humanity, and such was doubtless the proper construction of the fugitive slave law in this case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The courts of this District probably had power to dispose of this subject, but indicated distrust of their being so organized as to insure the proper constitutional construction in behalf of humanity. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/> That a day of <unclear>eck ing</unclear> comes sooner or <unclear></unclear> for nations, as well as individuals, is the <unclear>var</unclear> teaching of history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>If there be a past <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, it is impossible that a man or a nation <unclear></unclear> ultimately escape the consequences of wrong doing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>The <rs>North</rs>, in the plenitude of its power and wealth, may imagine that it will escape the common doom, and in the self-complacency of its rank fanaticism may believe that it is doing to others as it would be done by; but none the less inevitable is its eventual punishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>For every drop of blood that it has <unclear>hed</unclear> in this unholy invasion, for every tear of misery, it will yet pay drop for drop and tear for tear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>Their fields will yet be done lated, and their firesides be visited, by a more desolating and pervading <unclear>scourge</unclear> than that from which the <rs>South</rs> now suffers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>There is no hereafter for nations they must be punished here if punished at all, and that they always are punished here the <num value="1000">thousand</num> wreaks of once powerful empires, which are borne by on the stream of history, conclusively prove. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/> The <rs>North</rs> expects to escape this common doom by persevering in the crime which has provoked it, and establishing by force a unity which, in its fond delusion, will forever preserve its peace as well as prosperity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>Unity of the <name>States</name> is its idol, because unity, in its opinion, not only fills its purse, but preserves it from that fearful certainty, a war at home, from which it has not suffered since the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>The lion does not appear to be lying down with the lamb in that section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>And, until the <unclear>millenium</unclear> does come, the <rs>North</rs> must not expect to escape that fate which has visited every other considerable nation of the world from the beginning of time; a war in its own borders.

The fanaticism which now manifest itself in antislavery, will make war upon every institution &mdash; social, religious, or political &mdash; which is distasteful to it, as soon as it can do so with impunity.

Another element of future trouble is the foreign element which they have enlisted for the destruction of the <rs>South</rs>, and which may yet prove the instrument of their own ruin and subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>Already foreigners compose at least <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> of the <rs>Northern</rs> population, and though lately the victims of persecution, they are now the main reliance of the <rs>Northern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>They like the <rs>North</rs> no better than the <rs>South</rs>; they cling to their own nationality, custom, language, and red republicanism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>The time will come, we believe; when to the very heart of the <rs>North</rs> there will be a war of races, and of clashing interests, which will desolate every <unclear>naid</unclear> and city, drench every fireside in blood and avenge under every roof-tree the horrors now visited on the innocent Southern people. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>As a literary <unclear>mor</unclear> it is unique, and no passage could be found in all his works more characteristic of the author's peculiar style.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/> I hesitate, from the apprehension of ridicule, when I approach the delicate subject of my early love.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>By this word I do not mean the polite attention, the gallantry without hope or design, which has originated in the spirit of chivalry, and forever woven with the torture of <name>French</name> manners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/>I understood by this passion, the union of desire, friendship, and tenderness, which is inflamed by a siegle female, which prefers her to the rest of her sex, and which seeks her possession as the supreme or the sole happiness of our feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/>I need not blush at recollecting the object of my choice, and though my love was disappointed of success I am rather proud that I was once capable of feeling such a pure and exalted sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/>The personal attractions of <persName n="Unrchod,,Mademoiselle,Susan,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00411" reg="default:Unrchod,Mademoiselle,Susan,,"><foreName>Mademoiselle</foreName> <foreName>Susan</foreName> <surname>Unrchod</surname></persName> were embellished by the virtues and talents of the mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>The profession of her father did not extinguish the moderation and philosophy of his temper, and he lived content with a small salary and laborious duty in the obscure lot of minister of Craffy, in the mountains that separate the <rs>Pays de Vaud</rs> from the country <rs>Burgundy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/>In the solitude of a sequestered village he bestowed a liberal and even a learned education on his daughter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/> The report of such a prodigy awakened my curiosity; I saw and loved I found her learned, without pedantry; lively in conversation, pureth sentiment, and elegant in her manners; and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sudden emotion was fortified by the habits and knowledge of a more familiar acquaintance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>She permitted me to make <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> visits to her father's home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>I passed some happy days there, in the mountains of Burgundy, and her parents honorably encouraged the connection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/>In a calm retirement, the gay vanity of youth no longer fluttered in her bosom; she listened to the voice of truth and passion, and I might presume to hope that I had made some impression on a virtuous heart.--At Craffy and Lusaune I indulged my dream of felicity; but on my return to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, I soon discovered that my father would not hear of this strange alliance, and that without his consent I was destitute and helpless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/>After a painful struggle I yielded to my fate; I sighed as a lover, I obeyed as a son, my wound was insensibly healed by time, absence and the habits of a new life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>My cure was accelerated by a faithful report of the tranquility and cheerfulness of the lady herself, and my love subsided in friendship and esteem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>The minister of Craffy soon after wards died; his stipend died with him; his daughter retired to <placeName reg="Geneva, Ontario, New York" key="tgn,2069365">Geneva</placeName>, where, by teaching young ladies, she earned a hard subsistence for herself and mother; but, in her lowest distress, she maintained a spotless reputation and dignified behavior.
