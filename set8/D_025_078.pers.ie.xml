<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>There are several subjects which I would like to present in this letter, but which, for peculiar reasons (as you will learn from a private note), I must reserve for another communication. </p> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/> I will therefore conclude this epistle with a short reference to the views of the leading rebels with whom I came in contact, on the subject of peace and foreign intervention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>All of the officers of the <rs>Government</rs> with whom I conversed, from <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00050" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName n="Jefferson">Jeff.</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> down to <persName n="Alexander,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00051" reg="mostcommon:Alexander,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Alexander</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Castle Thunder">Castle Thunder</placeName> (a great descent to be sure), were emphatic in declaring that peace could only be established with the independence of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>; that any propositions having in view the reconstruction or restoration of the <rs>Union</rs> would be simply preposterous and insulting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>They express great confidence that at no distant day their nationality will be recognized by both the <rs>French</rs> and British Governments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>In <num value="1">one</num> of my conversations with <persName n="Seddon,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00052" reg="mostcommon:Seddon,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seddon</surname></persName>, the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, he said, among other things, that the intervention of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, when necessary, could be relied upon as a certainty; and that he believed the only reason the <rs>Emperor</rs> has delayed it so long was his desire that the <rs>South</rs> should exhaust her own resources, and become embarrassed as far as possible, before lending her a helping hand, in order that he might lay her under greater obligations, and be in a position to dictate terms of treaty and alliance the more to his interest and advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>But, he continued in the same conversation, let the <rs>Confederacy</rs> once be recognized, and peace with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> established, and <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00053" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> will not belong in finding out that the <rs>Southern</rs> people are not to be made the tools of any <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> monarchy, and that the geographical and agricultural relations of their country and <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, as well as their commercial interests, demand that they should be of the same nationality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>In the same connection he said, with regard to the <rs>British Government</rs>, that its policy towards the <rs>Confederacy</rs> had been of the most cowardly and mercenary character, while towards the <rs>North</rs> it had exhibited unmistakable symptoms of treachery and aversion; and that he hoped the <rs>North</rs> would soon become satisfied that they were waging a fruitless and hopeless war, and, after making peace with the <rs>South</rs>, would make good its loss of territory, and at the same time punish the insolence and perfidy of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, by annexing the <name>Canadas</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>It was not at all likely that such a character should appear at any period above the public horizon, and especially a period of great political convulsion, without exciting jealousy, misconstruction, envy, hatred, malice, and all uncharitableness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>We defy any public man to pass through the world without enemies who discharges his duties without fear, favor, or affection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/><persName n="Washington,,George,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00136" reg="default:Washington,George,,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName>, whilst his shoulders were broad enough to carry through such a war as the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Revolution by his almost unsupported strength, bore himself with such proud dignity and reserve, held so tenaciously to his own convictions of right, and had such an inflexible will of his own, that he was never, till he had completed his great work, in much danger of the &#x0022;Wo unto you when all men shall speak well of you,&#x0022; which the <name>Gospel</name> pronounces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>For <num value="7">seven</num> long years he toiled and struggled not only against <name>British</name> arms, but against the detraction, and open and secret opposition of his own countrymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>Not only his political, but his military character was aspersed; it was said that he had never gained a battle, that he was always retreating, and others were mentioned, who were said to be much fitter than himself to lead the armies and guide the affairs of State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>Even some of his own friends deserted him, and at <num value="1">one</num> time his majestic form stood almost alone, but still proudly erect, self-reliant and heaven-supported.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>Even after he had delivered the nation from the house of bondage, there were not wanting many to murmur against him, as the <name>Israelites</name> did against <persName n="Moses,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00137" reg="mostcommon:Moses,nomatch:0"><surname>Moses</surname></persName>, and as mankind in every age have murmured against their greatest benefactors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>He was accused of being in the interest of the very country from which he had wrested the independence of <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>, and of desiring to impose a Government akin to monarchy upon the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>All these assaults and persecutions, however, did no damage except to their authors, never disturbing for a moment the equanimity of him against whom they were aimed; but it was not until death consecrated his labors and his name that the tongue of calumny was hushed, and the clouds, which had vainly sought to eclipse the mighty orb, were scattered from his path, and were compelled themselves to reflect the glory of the setting sun. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>But that the enemy derived great aid and comfort from these unseemly and impolitic demonstrations cannot be doubted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>We who are embarked in a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> and more gigantic Revolution should learn a lesson from the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>We are strong enough, if united, to achieve our independence; but the house that is divided against itself cannot stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>At all events, if we desire that this war shall not be even longer than that of '<num value="76">76</num>, we must work together, knowing that in union is strength, and that in discord and bickering is weakness, discouragement, and peril.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>Let us seek to inspire each other's hearts by mutual confidence; to invigorate each other's arms by mutual cooperation, and thus to convince our adversaries and the world at large that we are a unit, knowing no enemies but the enemies of our country, and determined to sacrifice all personal feelings, prejudices, and animosities upon the altar of the common good. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
