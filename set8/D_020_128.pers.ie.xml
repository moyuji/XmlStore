<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The fact has been already noticed in this paper, through a brief item from a Northern journal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>It is plain, from the points touched upon, that there is much of his animadversion omitted in the <hi rend="italics">Times.</hi> It is gratifying to see this <num value="1">one</num> of the many proofs of the manner the <rs>English</rs> mind is being educated on the subject of our national difficulties. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> <persName n="Jervis,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Jervis,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Jervis</surname></persName>, M. P., who, on rising, met with a cordial reception, said--<persName n="Chairman,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Chairman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chairman</surname></persName> and gentlemen, I have been requested, and I have thought it right, that I should appear before you and address to you a few words with reference to a question which I think, at the present day, is likely to become <num value="1">one</num> of the prominent questions of this country; and having devoted some time to that question, and being in the habit of giving an independent vote when it is necessary, I have deemed it expedient that I should tell you the basis upon which I have come to the conclusion which I entertain upon the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>We in the eastern counties having had <num value="1">one</num> of the most bountiful harvests which have been known for many years, and looking forward to another year of plenty for every man to depend upon, it is but right that we should consider what is the condition of our fellow-subjects in different parts of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>You must remember that some years ago there was a very extensive famine in <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName>, which caused not only great distress in that but in the other provinces of this empire; for it is impossible that any number of our fellow countrymen should feel distress without it being fully participated in through out the length and breadth of the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>We may not perhaps be called upon to expect a deficiency of wheat or any other description of agricultural produce; but there is another crop upon which it is estimated <num value="5000000">five millions</num> of people depend, which is likely to fail them-in the ensuing winter; and I know no time more opportune to think what will occur in the ensuing season and to consider this question than while the weather is still warm and the sun shining.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Many of you must know as well as my self that the bread of life cannot be taken from the large population of the manufacturing districts without causing some of the most distressing scenes that human nature can witness; and when we come to consider that throughout <placeName key="tgn,7008154" n="1.000 10" reg="lancashire,england,united kingdom,europe">Lancashire</placeName> the people are working half time &mdash; that is, <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> instead of <num value="6">six</num>--and if that is the case in <dateStruct value="-09-"><month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct>, what are they likely to do in <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>We can imagine what is likely to be the distress in that part of the county.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>It may be asked, as I have seen it in some newspapers of the day. What has that to do with <placeName reg="Essex, England, United Kingdom" key="tgn,7008131">Essex</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Now I say the people cannot suffer in <placeName key="tgn,7008154" n="1.000 10" reg="lancashire,england,united kingdom,europe">Lancashire</placeName> without you feeling it in <placeName reg="Essex, England, United Kingdom" key="tgn,7008131">Essex</placeName>; and I will endeavor by a few figures to show you why I say so. The traffic between this country and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> where the cotton is produced, and by the manufacture of which so large a class is fed, amounted during the past year to &#x00A3;<num value="67631993">67,631,993</num>, that is to say that there was over &#x00A3;<num value="44000000">44,000,000</num> of imports from <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> and over &#x00A3;<num value="22000000">22,000,000</num> in exports; and you cannot suddenly put an end to such a portion as &#x00A3;<num value="67000000">67,000,000</num> sterling worth of commerce without deeply affecting this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>When I tell you, too, that out of that portion there is in the shape of cotton alone something like &#x00A3;<num value="30000000">30,000,000</num> worth of raw material to be manufactured &mdash; that out of the vast quantity of cotton produce which comes from the manufacturing districts, besides what is purchased in this country, there are &#x00A3;<num value="52000000">52,000,000</num> worth exported, making a difference between the raw material exported and imported, without calculating what we consume ourselves, of over &#x00A3;<num value="22000000">22,000,000</num>, you will be able to form an idea of the amount lost to the manufacturing population of this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>(Hear, hear.) I wish to be clear on the point of figures, because there have been some doubt thrown upon them, but they have been collected from the returns of the <orgName n="Trade Board" type="board">Board of Trade</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>It will give you, perhaps, a clearer idea of the vast amount of the produce exported when I tell you that simply as regards plain calico, &#x00A3;<num value="23000000">23,000,000</num> worth alone is exported, and of <rs n="plain sewing" type="product">plain sewing</rs> cotton &#x00A3;<num value="700000">700,000</num>; a produce affecting not only <placeName key="tgn,7008154" n="1.000 10" reg="lancashire,england,united kingdom,europe">Lancashire</placeName>, but other districts, such as <placeName key="tgn,7008154" n="1.000 10" reg="lancashire,england,united kingdom,europe">Lancashire</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>It has been said by people holding strong notions, that our operatives ought to starve all the winter, rather than that we should interfere in the quarrel that is now taking place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>I am the last person to ask this country to interfere in any quarrel in which the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> are engaged; but I cannot view it in that light &mdash; I merely look to what will be the sufferings of the manufacturing population, and ask you to give your confidence to that Government which will mitigate the evil arising from it. I, as an humble member of the <orgName n="House of Commons" type="government">House of Commons</orgName> am not going to place my opinion against that of <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName>, whose judgment is so much thought of by all <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>; but I must say that, if it is necessary for the <rs>Government</rs> to interfere in the quarrel for the sake of alleviating the distress of the population at home, I shall certainly give them my best support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>It is also said we should not interfere because the <rs>Northern States</rs> are against slavery; but that is a question imported into the matter by interested parties, which I shall be able to show you is not only a gross error, but that they ought to know that it is so. It is very true that slavery exists only in the <rs>Southern States</rs>; but the <rs>North</rs> has ever fully recognized it as an institution, and has never entertained any idea of putting an end to it. The question of slavery in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> is <num value="1">one</num> of labor; and, though having a great horror of slavery myself I must admit that it is backed up by men of the <rs>Northern States</rs>, because if it were abolished they could not profit by it. The question of slavery was brought prominently forward in the <orgName n="America Congress" type="congress">Congress of America</orgName> in the year <dateStruct value="1790--"><year reg="1790">1790</year></dateStruct>, when, at that time, <num value="2">two</num> <num value=".333">thirds</num> of the <rs>Congress</rs> were Northerners, and I will read you a resolution passed by that body, which was, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of all, submitted to a committee of <num value="7">seven</num>, <num value="6">six</num> of whom were Northerners, and only <num value="1">one</num> of them was a Southerner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>That resolution was subsequently passed unanimously by the whole Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>It was thus: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> &#x0022;That Congress have no authority to interfere in the emancipation of slaves or in the treatment of them in any of the <name>States</name>, it remaining with the several States alone to provide rules and regulations therein which humanity and true policy may require.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="whole Congress"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> It is true that it was after that date that we in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> took so prominent a part in the emancipation of slavery; but after the whole matter had been almost accomplished by us, what was the feeling of <placeName reg="North America" key="tgn,1000001">North America</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Why, I find that most distinguished man, <placeName reg="Daniel Webster">Daniel Webster</placeName>, who represented <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> as a Senator, said in <dateStruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></dateStruct>, with regard to this very resolution which I have quoted: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> <q>&#x0022;The <rs type="place">House</rs> agreed to insert these resolutions in its Journal, and from that day to this it has never been maintained or contended that Congress had any authority to regulate or interfere with the condition of slaves in the several States.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> He was at that time contending against a feeling which the <rs>South</rs> expressed, that they thought there was a wish on the part of the <rs>Northern States</rs> to abolish slavery, and he, as the leading man of the <rs>Northern States</rs>, and speaking in their name, so far from condemning slavery, denied that there was any wish, on their part to abolish it. It was not till the year <dateStruct value="1834--"><year reg="1834">1834</year></dateStruct> that slavery was abolished in our colonies, and some might fancy that the <rs>North</rs> had followed our example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>But a most important question arose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>I make these observation s to show that there is no truth whatever in the rumor of any intention on the part of the <rs>Northern States</rs> to abolish slavery by this quarrel. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> It is not a question between us and slavery; but simply how we are to obtain cotton wherewith to feed our large manufacturing population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>It may be said that we have nothing to do with cotton; that we are going to be happy in <placeName reg="Essex, England, United Kingdom" key="tgn,7008131">Essex</placeName> all the winter, spend a merry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/> I find that owing to this quarrel, besides cotton, a great portion of our mercantile transactions between this country and <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> are at a stand-still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Take the case of <rs n="tea cups" type="product">tea-cups</rs> and plates, which are <placeName key="tgn,7008174" n="1.000 9" reg="staffordshire,england,united kingdom,europe">Staffordshire</placeName> ware.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>That shows that not only the cotton, iron, and <rs n="earthen ware" type="product">earthen ware</rs> interests are concerned, but that the agriculturalists do not export as they have been in the habit of doing. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Then it is said that the <rs>Southern States</rs> have no right whatever to secede.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Now, that is a question upon which <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs> would not differ very much, for they are fond of local Government; and I am not at all certain that, if <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> formed a portion of another territory, she would long recognize that power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>I wish to show you that the right of secession has long been recognized by the statesmen of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/> This confederation last some years, but owing to the intercourse which was carried on between several of the <name>States</name> and foreign countries, it was found that great inconvenience followed upon each carrying on negotiations which must be antagonistic to the general welfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>There were too very large parties formed in that country; at the head of <num value="1">one</num> was <persName n="Hamilton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Hamilton,nomatch:0"><surname>Hamilton</surname></persName>, and the other <rs>Jefferson</rs>, both of whom had been originally much interested in carrying on the rebellion against this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>At last it was agreed that they should unite so far that there should be a Central Government, and that they should have the power of levying the general taxes, making peace and war, and negotiating with foreign countries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Yet to show how carefully those States went into the original confederation before signing the articles, I will read you an extract from the instructions sent to the delegates of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>--that State which at the present time, is kept in terror by the <rs>Northern</rs> troops: </p> <cit><q rend="break">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/> That was the idea of the people before they even joined the <name>Confederation</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>We find that subsequently to the <orgName n="States Union" type="union">union of the States</orgName> the same broad question arose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Large sums had been borrowed by some States, and some by others, and it became a question whether each State should be left to pay its own debts; and <persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName> tells us he was only induced, as a member of the <rs>Government</rs>, to vote for the <rs>Congress</rs> adopting the whole debt, from the fact that many of the <name>States</name> had threatened to secede.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>In the year <dateStruct value="1797--"><year reg="1797">1797</year></dateStruct> we have the fact that <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> (than whom there was no man more thoroughly acquainted with his countrymen) wrote, on his retirement from office, an epistle which at the time rendered him very unpopular, to the effect that, if at any time any portion of the <name>States</name> attempted to carry their own interests to the detriment of other States, the <rs>Republic</rs> would break up.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/> I quote these examples to show that the question of secession is as old as the <name>States</name> themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>They agreed to form a Confederation and Union; but at the same time it was well known that as soon as the interest of <num value="1">one</num> section of the <name>States</name> differed from another they should secede, and the more amicably that takes place the better it will be for human nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>As an instance of what our own country has done in such questions, I would recall to your recollection that at the time we emancipated the slaves in our colonies the <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> settlers on the <rs type="place">Cape of Good Hope</rs> objected to it, left their territory, and settled on the <placeName key="tgn,2560175;tgn,2560174;tgn,1128130" n="0.004 000000.1300	placename;tgn,2560175;Orange River, Washington, Maine,Washington,Maine,United States,North and Central America;0.004 000000.1300	placename;tgn,2560174;Orange River, Lee, Florida,Lee,Florida,United States,North and Central America;0.004 000000.1080	placename;tgn,1128130;Orange,Africa,Africa" reg="Orange River, Washington, Maine,Washington,Maine,United States,North and Central America;Orange River, Lee, Florida,Lee,Florida,United States,North and Central America;Orange,Africa,Africa">Orange river</placeName>; and <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> had since always recognized that territory as independent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Again, as far back as the year <dateStruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></dateStruct>, <persName n="Ireland,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Ireland,nomatch:0"><surname>Ireland</surname></persName> objected to our governing it, and carried a resolution into its parliament that it only recognized the <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> Legislature, and <persName><foreName>George</foreName> <genName n="3">III</genName></persName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/> We had then undergone the sad experience of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> war, and we recognized that independence, and it was only by sound argument, and not by attempted force, that we had brought them back again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>I have endeavored to bring the question before you in <num value="3">three</num> points--<num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, that the question of cot on has nothing to do with the question of slavery, and that we do not stand up for the <rs>North</rs> or the <rs>South</rs>; secondly, that the question of slavery is only introduced from interested motives; and, thirdly, that of secession, which the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> call rebellion, is simply a large population, numbering over <num value="9000000">nine millions</num>, and covering an area of <num value="850000">850,000</num> square miles, wishing to govern themselves, but are stopped by their neighbors. </p>

<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/> --There are a good many theories on this subject, but if we are not mistaken, it would puzzle the <rs>Northern</rs> people themselves to give a satisfactory answer to the question what the war is for. The general reply is that it is to preserve <q>&#x0022;the <orgName n="Glorious Union" type="union">glorious Union</orgName>,&#x0022;</q> but besides this vague and unmeaning generality, there seems to be no unity of design or purpose even among our enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>If there is, we look in vain for its expression in any manifestation of public opinion that we have yet seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>As every-body has a speculation on the object of the war, we may as well have ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>From the moment that it became obvious the border States would not promptly make common cause with the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> States, we believed that war was inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>We are not sure that even with the united action of all the <rs>Southern States</rs> separation could have been accomplished without war, but it hold out, as we thought, the best chance of a pacific solution; and for this, among other reasons, we advocated the early secession of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>War once commenced, no <num value="1">one</num> who understands the interests of the <rs>North</rs> in the <rs>Union</rs>, and the temper of the <rs>Northern</rs> people, could anticipate a short struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>If we had been able promptly to follow up the <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">battle of Manassas</rs>, as far even as the occupation of <placeName key="tgn,2137140;tgn,2137139;tgn,2137138;tgn,2137137;tgn,2137136;tgn,2115247" n="0.010 000000.8680	placename;tgn,2137140;Arlington Heights, Weber, Utah,Weber,Utah,United States,North and Central America;0.010 000000.8680	placename;tgn,2137139;Arlington Heights, Nueces, Texas,Nueces,Texas,United States,North and Central America;0.010 000000.8680	placename;tgn,2137138;Arlington Heights, Washington, Ohio,Washington,Ohio,United States,North and Central America;0.010 000000.8680	placename;tgn,2137137;Arlington Heights, Sangamon, Illinois,Sangamon,Illinois,United States,North and Central America;0.010 000000.8680	placename;tgn,2137136;Arlington Heights, Plumas, California,Plumas,California,United States,North and Central America;0.010 000000.8680	placename;tgn,2115247;Arlington Heights, Snohomish, Washington,Snohomish,Washington,United States,North and Central America" reg="Arlington Heights, Weber, Utah,Weber,Utah,United States,North and Central America;Arlington Heights, Nueces, Texas,Nueces,Texas,United States,North and Central America;Arlington Heights, Washington, Ohio,Washington,Ohio,United States,North and Central America;Arlington Heights, Sangamon, Illinois,Sangamon,Illinois,United States,North and Central America;Arlington Heights, Plumas, California,Plumas,California,United States,North and Central America;Arlington Heights, Snohomish, Washington,Snohomish,Washington,United States,North and Central America">Arlington Heights</placeName>, so as, without occupying <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, to hold a rod <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="lat">in terrorem</foreign></hi> over it, we should be a good deal nearer peace than we now are. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/> But what is this war for?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>We think it is just for what <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00114" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> says it is &mdash; the subjugation of the <rs>Southern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>It is useless to say that no sane <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> can indulge such an idea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>No <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> is sane upon this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>The consolidation idea in the <rs>Northern</rs> mind is universal and ineradicable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>You might as well attempt to convince a Northern man that the city and <placeName reg="county of New York">county of New York</placeName> are not part of the <rs>State</rs> of that name, or that <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> does not belong to <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, as that the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> is not a part of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>They look upon it as we look upon <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Northwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName>, and mean to bring it back just as we mean to bring back the <q>&#x0022;State of <placeName key="tgn,1125392" n="1.000 13" reg="kanawha, west virginia, united states">Kanawha</placeName>&#x0022;</q> to where it belongs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>They think they can do it, for they have capital, numbers, great cities, all the outside show of wealth and power, whilst the <rs>South</rs> has a large, sparsely settled territory, with a comparatively small population, with no money, no manufactures, no commerce, its ports all closed to the outside world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>If they cannot whip us at once in the field, they think they can tire us out and starve us out. If education and intelligence were as universal in the <rs>North</rs> as they pretend, they would never entertain such absurd notions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>They do not understand either Southern resources, Southern character, or the decisiveness and solemnity of this great occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>It is evident that they expect all this commotion will pass away like a summer cloud; that, here and there, the lighting will scathe some homestead and the hail desolate some field, but that, on the whole, the atmosphere will be purified, and the future more healthful and brighter than the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>The value of the <rs>Union</rs> to the <rs>North</rs> shows us the precise amount in dollars and cents of what the <rs>North</rs> is fighting for. Calculate the amount of Southern contributions to Northern commerce, manufactures, trade, and enterprise in every form, and you have what the <rs>North</rs> is fighting for in figures which cannot lie. We do not say that this is the only spring and motive of the war. The Northern mind has of late years been abolitionized, and the anti-slavery element adds its sullen fire to the threatening flame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>The irritation, arising from the carefully disseminated idea that the <rs>South</rs> looks upon the <rs>North</rs> as a race of cowards, has also more to do with the persistency with which this war is and will be waged than is generally imagined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>Another object was disclosed in a speech of <persName n="Grow,,G.,A.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00115" reg="default:Grow,G.,A.,,"><foreName>G.</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Grow</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Speaker">Speaker</rs> of the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/> Your fathers believed that it was <num value="1">one</num> of the questions of vital importance for the future of the country, that no foreign jurisdiction should have a home at the mouth of the <placeName key="tgn,7022231" n="1.000 1584" reg="mississippi river">Mississippi</placeName> or in <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>; and yet to-day the man who settled those territories you permit to organize into States, and to set up an independent jurisdiction over them &mdash; an act for which your fathers were ready to wage war and peril their lives to prevent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>To-day you are ready to permit traitors at home to do what no foreign power heretofore dare attempt. * * * * * * * * </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/> Let there be but <num value="1">one</num> war; better it should cost <num value="1000000">millions</num> of lives than that we should live in hourly dread of wars, contiguous to a people who could make foreign alliances and land armies upon our shores to destroy our liberties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/> The <orgName n="New York Tribune" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi></orgName>, commenting on this somewhat significant and remarkable observation, said that the considerations suggested by <rs type="role" reg="Mister Speaker">Mr. Speaker</rs> Grow were practical, and that the dangers and necessities alluded to by him were wholly outside of the text of the written constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>Said the editor: </p> <cit><q rend="break">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/> The abstract right of secession might be proved clear as the noonday sun, and its assertion be recognized by all the powers of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, but yet the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> could never concede it, and will never concede it, till their power as a nation is utterly broken and gone.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/> There is, in fine, no end to the variety of motives and objects of this war. We predict that it will end when the <rs>North</rs> becomes unable to prosecute it, and not before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>Our only wonder is, that anybody could ever doubt what the war was for, or imagine that it would be of short duration. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>A brief paragraph respecting it was re-published in the <hi rend="italics">Dispatch</hi> some time since, but the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> full report is that which we now copy from the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>This liberal speech is <num value="1">one</num> of many exhibitions of the manner in which the <rs>English</rs> mind is being educated upon the great Southern question.--Hitherto, the malignant misrepresentations of our enemies, have prejudiced the <rs>South</rs>, its people, resources, and character throughout all <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>The masses of the old world have been as completely beclouded in their perceptions of Southern affairs as if we were inhabitants of another sphere; and even the higher orders have, until lately, been completely hood-winked by the unscrupulous falsehoods of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>A statesman of no less intelligence and calibre than <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Elgin</foreName></persName>, late <rs type="role" reg="Governor-General">Governor-General</rs> of <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>, informed a distinguished Southern gentleman, in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, a few years ago, that before he visited this country he always thought the great preponderance of wealth, statesmanship, intelligence and power was in the <rs>North</rs>, and that the <rs>South</rs> was a more appendage of the <rs>Northern</rs> seat of empire; but that, upon personal examination, that opinion had been exactly reversed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>Thus such speeches as those of <persName n="Jervis,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00118" reg="mostcommon:Jervis,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Jervis</surname></persName> will go far to disabuse the public mind of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> of anti-Southern prejudices, stimulated, as the <rs>English</rs> mind now is, by the influence of those vital interests which unite the welfare of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> intimately and indissolubly with that of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>It will be observed that <placeName reg="Essex, England, United Kingdom" key="tgn,7008131">Essex county</placeName>, to which <persName n="Jervis,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00119" reg="mostcommon:Jervis,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Jervis</surname></persName> addresses himself, is an agricultural, not a manufacturing county, and that he demonstrates to his audience that not only the manufacturing, but every great interest of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, is involved in the <rs>Southern</rs> question.
