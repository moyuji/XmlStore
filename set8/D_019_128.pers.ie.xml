<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>I have read with special attention your remarks upon this subject, and have labored to impress upon the minds of our people its importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>Since I was <measure n="8years" type="date">eight years</measure> old I have been from time to time, roaming over the hills and through the valleys of <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>, in search of such game as infest our mountainous country, until to-day; I have no hesitancy in saying that <num value="29">twenty-nine</num> out of every <num value="30">thirty</num> squirrels I shoot at, will be stewed without an eye and a great portion of his head. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>This is no bragging, but is a simple fact, which I can prove.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>And yet, I am far from being the best shot in the county; there are plenty more as good, if not better, than I am. Would it not be wrong to take this kind of material and put it in service where this knowledge would be useless?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>I think so. Another objection to the regular service is this: I, with many others, know nothing about military drill, literally nothing, and would be unfit to perform the duties of a soldier for months to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>But, accept us in our hunting garb, with our squirrel and deer guns upon our shoulders, and a good bowie-knife; relieve us of <q>&#x0022;shoulder arms,&#x0022;</q><q>&#x0022;carry arms,&#x0022;</q><q>&#x0022;mark time,&#x0022;</q> &#x0026;c., &#x0026;c., and we'll promise that for every crack of our rifles a hated <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> will bite the dust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/> Camp duties have prevented my writing to you before this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>Having now a few hours' leisure, I avail myself of the opportunity to give you some information of things transpiring here, knowing that your entire community are anxiously awaiting authentic intelligence from us. Leaving the <rs type="place">Hermitage Fair Grounds</rs> on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> at <time value="10oclock">10 o'clock</time>, we expected to make the trip to this place in the usual time, but did not arrive until Sunday at <time value="2pm">2 o'clock P.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/> If the hearts of our men needed inspiration, the tears of our wives, mothers, sisters, and which even bedewed the cheeks of iron manhood at parting from us, were enough to nerve them to do battle to the death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>Stirred as were our softer feelings for a while, the buoyancy of the soldier soon returned, and song after song beguiled the tedium of the journey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>Along the route the greeting we received was a perfect ovation, and a <q>&#x0022;<name n="God" type="God">God</name> speed you&#x0022;</q> was given to us from every farm-house and dwelling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>At each stopping place the train was surrounded by crowds of both sexes and all ages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>The sound of the axe and hammer broke the stillness of the <name>Sabbath</name> day, and in a few hours the white tents of the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 1">First Regiment</orgName> of <orgName type="mil" key="VAVolunteer">Virginia Volunteers</orgName> were shining in the sun. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/> The country here is fair enough to look upon, but, much to our surprise, we soon found that water was scarce; that which we are able to get in the immediate vicinity of the camp is the color of the freestone strata through which it flows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>Of this mineral there seems to be an inexhaustible quantity, the entire soil partaking of its dull red color.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>There is something of a village here, consisting of <num value="1">one</num> tavern, <num value="2">two</num> stores and several private dwellings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>Within the circuit of a mile or <num value="2">two</num> are several handsome residences. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>What our force is, of course I will not say; but, few or many, their numbers and resolution are sufficient to give any force that the enemy can well spare from their boasted <num value="1000">thousands</num> a welcome with bloody hands to hospitable graves.--There is no sickness of consequence among our men, and all are in excellent spirits, and rapidly acquitting that degree of proficiency in drill necessary to fit them for the art of war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/> On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, about <time value="10oclock">10 o'clock</time>, the intelligence spread like lightning through the camp that <num value="2">two</num> of our scouts, having approached too near <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>, were killed, and that the enemy were rapidly moving upon us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>Not a cheek turned pale, not an arm was unnerved; but the bearing of each man bespoke every inch the soldier, and a thrill of almost savage joy went from heart to heart at the thought that the hour was near at hand to strike a blow for our homes, our loved ones, and our honor &mdash; an hour of terrible retribution for the many insults and wrongs inflicted upon a long suffering people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>Men who had left their peaceful a vocations at the call of their country, all unused to scenes of bloody strife, whose only ambition had, perhaps, been to pass their lives in the midst of domestic tranquility, were, as if by the wand of some arch magician, transformed into heroes, not only ready, but eager to go forth and offer up their lives in defence of a principle as eternal as the heavens &mdash; the principle of <hi rend="italics">justice.</hi> No cheers <q>&#x0022;rent the air.&#x0022;</q> There was none of the loud talking and bluster with which the bully seeks to hide his fear; quietly and quickly falling into ranks, every man stood ready for the word of command, and within less than half an hour from the moment of the call to arms we were on our way to meet the foe. Our march could not have been more disagreeable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>The deep dust that filled the road was hurled into our faces in blinding clouds by a high wind, blinding and almost suffocating us. But this was almost unheeded, and our columns pressed rapidly on.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>While there, we were met by a portion of the <orgName type="mil" key="SCRegiment">S. C. Regiment</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>They had preceded us several hours in anticipation of a fight and were then returning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>From them we learned that the rumored killing of our scouts and the advance of the enemy were unfounded, everything being quiet ahead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>Great was their disappointment and our own, and throwing themselves upon the grass under the protecting shade of the beautiful wood that bordered the pretty little stream, our men gave free expression to their regret that they were not yet to have a brush.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>Just at this time, <persName n="Bonham,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00165" reg="mostcommon:Bonham,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bonham</surname></persName>, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in command here, came riding down the road from the direction opposite to that from which we had come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/> <persName n="Bonaparte,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00661" reg="mostcommon:Bonaparte,nomatch:0"><surname>Bonaparte</surname></persName>, it is said, was more agitated at this crisis than when, a moment before he was so near being captured by the <name>Russians</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/>But as he saw those <num value="70">seventy</num> squadrons come down on a plunging trot, pressing hard after the white plume of <persName n="Murat,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00662" reg="mostcommon:Murat,nomatch:0"><surname>Murat</surname></persName>, that streamed through the snow storm far in front a smile passed over his countenance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/> The earth groaned and trembled as they passed, and the sabres, above the dark and angry mass below, looked like the foam of a sea wave as it crests on the deep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/>The rattling of their armor, and the muffled thunder of their tread, drowned all the roar of battle, as with firm, set array, and swift, steady motion, they bore down with their terrible front on the foe. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/> The shock of that immense host was like a falling mountain, and the front line of the <rs>Russian</rs> army went down like frost work before it. Then commenced a protracted fight of hand to hand, and sword to sword, as in the cavalry action at Eckmubl.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/>The clashing of steel was like the ringing of countless hammers, and horses and riders were blended in wild confusion together; the <rs>Russian</rs> reserve were ordered up, and on these <persName n="Murat,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00663" reg="mostcommon:Murat,nomatch:0"><surname>Murat</surname></persName> fell with his fierce horsemen, crushing and trampling them down by <num value="1000">thousands</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/>But the obstinate <rs>Russians</rs> disdained to fly, and rallied again and again, so that it was no longer cavalry charging on infantry, but squadrons of horse galloping through broken hosts that, gathering into knots, still disputed, with unparalleled bravery, the red and rent field. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/> It was during this strange fight that <persName n="Murat,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00664" reg="mostcommon:Murat,nomatch:0"><surname>Murat</surname></persName> was seen to perform <num value="1">one</num> of those desperate deeds for which he was so renowned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>Excited to the highest pitch of passion by the obstacles that opposed him, he seemed endowed with <num value="10">ten</num>-fold strength, and looked more like a superhuman being treading down helpless mortals than an ordinary man. Amid the roar of artillery, and rattling of musketry, and falling of sabre strokes like lightning about him, that lofty white plume never once went down, while ever and anon it was seen glaring through the smoke of battle, the star of hope to <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00665" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, and showing that his <q>&#x0022;right arm&#x0022;</q> was still uplifted and striking for victory. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/> He raged like an unloosed lion amid the foe; and his eyes, always terrible in battle, burned with increased lustre, while his clear and steady voice, heard above the turmoil of strife, was worth more than a <num value="1000">thousand</num> trumpets to cheer on his followers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>At length, seeing a knot of <persName n="Russian,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00666" reg="mostcommon:Russian,nomatch:0"><surname>Russian</surname></persName> soldiers that for a long time had kept up a devouring fire upon his men, he wheeled his horse and drove in full gallop upon their levelled muskets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/>A few of his guards, that never allowed that white plume to leave their sight, charged after him. Without waiting to count his foes, he seized his bridle in his teeth, and with his pistol in <num value="1">one</num> hand and his drawn sword in the other, burst in headlong fury upon them, and scattered them as if a hurricane had swept by. <persName n="Murat,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00667" reg="mostcommon:Murat,nomatch:0"><surname>Murat</surname></persName> was a thunderbolt on that day, and the deeds that were wrought by him will furnish themes for the poet and the painter.&#x0022; </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/> --The richest thing of the season, says the <orgName n="Newburyport Herald" type="newspaper">Newburyport Herald</orgName>, came off the other day, in the neighborhood of the market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/>The greatest <persName><foreName>Jonathan</foreName></persName> imaginable, decked out in a slouched hat, a long blue frock, and a pair of cowhide shoes, big as gondolas, with a huge whip under his arm, stalked in to a billiard saloon, where half a dozen persons were improving the time in trundling round the ivories, and, after recovering from his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> surprise at the to him singular aspect of the room, inquired if <q>&#x0022;any of'em had seen a stray steer,&#x0022;</q> affirming that <q>&#x0022;the blasted critter got away as he came through town with his drove t'other day, and he hadn't seen nothin' on him since.&#x0022;</q> The bloods denied all knowledge of the animal in question, and with much sly winking at each other, proceeded to condole with him on his loss in the most heartfelt manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>He watched the game with much interest, as he had evidently never seen nor heard of anything of the kind before, and created much amusement by his demonstrations of applause when a good shot was made--<q>&#x0022;<placeName key="possibilities=25" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Jerusalem</placeName> !&#x0022;</q> being a favorite interjection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/>At last he made bold to request the privilege of trying his skill, when he set the crowd in a roar by his awkward movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/>However, he gradually got his hand in, and played as well as could be expected for a greenhorn.-- All hands now began to praise him, which so elated him that he actually began to think himself a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> <persName n="Phelan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00668" reg="mostcommon:Phelan,nomatch:0"><surname>Phelan</surname></persName>, and he offered to bet a dollar with his opponent, which, of course, he lost, The loss and the laugh so irritated him that he offered to play another game and bet <measure n="2dollars" type="currency">two dollars</measure>, which he pulled out of a big roll &mdash; for it seems his cattle had sold well and he was quite flush.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>This bet he also lost, as the fool might have known he would; when, mad as a March hare, he pulled out a <num value="50">fifty</num> spot, the largest he had, and offered to bet that on another game.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>The crowd mustered round and raised money enough to cover it, and at it they went again, when, by some strange turn of luck, the greeny won. He now offered to put up the <num value="100">hundred</num> he had won against another <num value="100">hundred</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>Of course, he could not blunder into another game, so they could now win back what they had lost, and fleece the fellow of his own roll besides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>They sent out for a famous player, who happened to have money enough to bet with; another game was played, when <persName><foreName>Jonathan</foreName></persName> won. Another <num value="100">hundred</num> was also raised, and bet and won; and it was not until he had blundered through half a dozen games, and by some un- </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/> accountable run of luck, won them all, draining the pockets of his opponents of about <measure n="400dollars" type="currency">four hundred dollars</measure>, that they began to smell a very large <q>&#x0022;mice.&#x0022;</q> When everybody got tired of playing, gawky pulled his frock on over his head, took his whip under his arm and walked quietly out, turning round at the door and remarking, <q>&#x0022;Gentlemen if you should happen to see anything of that steer, I wish you'd let me know.&#x0022;</q> At last accounts they had not seen the steer, but they came to the conclusion that they saw the elephant. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
