<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> From the tone of the newspapers, and correspondence from various sections of the <rs>State</rs>, we have every reason to believe that the secession sentiment is decidedly on the increase in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>There seems, however, to be a general desire that every honorable and consistent effort at conciliation and adjustment should be resorted to and a full, fair and explicit demand of our rights be made, before the final step of disruption is taken.--Many of the counties are adopting measures of defence with a determination to be prepared for any emergency. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> We append a summary of information from other quarters, bearing upon the crisis in national affairs </p> 
<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s position Defined.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> The <orgName n="New York Tribune" type="newspaper">New York Tribune</orgName> makes the following apparently official editorial announcement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>It will be seen that <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> not only opposes any concession to the <rs>South</rs>, but threatens means of coercion: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> The question having anew been raised, we mean it proper to say again what we have said before, and we wish to be understood as saying it authoritatively, that <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> is not in favor of making concessions to the slave power, either pretended concessions or real concessions, nor in favor of any measure looking to the humiliation of freedom and of the free States, no matter in what pretense they may be commended. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> He believes, with the great body of the independent freemen of the country--<rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs>, <persName n="Bell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Bell,nomatch:0"><surname>Bell</surname></persName> men, and <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs>--that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> duty to be done is to ascertain whether we have a government or not, and whether the <rs>Union</rs> is a mere delusion of the imagination, to be dissolved at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> touch of actual hostility, or a great and vital power, as competent to assert itself and defend itself against domestic sedition as against foreign foes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>We have reason to know that he perceives and feels clearly that this is the predominant question of the time, towering above every other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Indeed, of what avail is any compromise or any arrangement whatever until it be <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> established that the <orgName n="States Union" type="union">Union of the States</orgName> and the <rs>Federal Government</rs> are something real and living, and not a precarious sham, built of nothing more substantial than parchment and red tape, and existing at the mercy of speaking traitors like <persName n="Floyd,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Floyd,nomatch:0"><surname>Floyd</surname></persName>, or noisy ones like <persName n="Toombs,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Toombs,nomatch:0"><surname>Toombs</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> No compromises, then!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>No delusive and deluding concessions!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>No surrender of principle!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>No cowardly reversal of the <name>Great Verdict</name> of <date value="11-06">the sixth of November!</date> Let us have the question of questions settled now and for all time!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>There can never be another opportunity so good as the present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Let us know once for all whether the slave power is really stronger than the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Let us have it decided whether the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> system of rebellion can be successfully introduced in this country as a means of carrying an election after it has been fairly lost at the polls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>It will be time enough to talk of redressing grievances of long standing and of minor consequence after this startling novelty has been disposed of. Let us <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> vindicate the majesty and assert the power of law in general &mdash; amendments of particular laws can be considered afterward. </p> </div4>

<head>The offer of New York troops.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The recent tender of the services of the <orgName type="division" n="Division 1">First Division of <placeName reg="New York" key="tgn,7007568">New York State</placeName></orgName> troops by <persName n="Sanford,Major-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Sanford,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major-General">Maj.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The <rs>Herald</rs> contains a column of communications expressing indignation at the <rs>General</rs>'s course, of which the following is a sample: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> I see by your morning's issue that <persName n="Sanford,Major-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Sanford,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major-General">Major General</roleName> <surname>Sanford</surname></persName> has, with the concurrence of the <rs>Division</rs> <orgName n="Officers Board" type="board">Board of Officers</orgName>, tendered to <persName n="Morgan,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Morgan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Morgan</surname></persName> the services of the entire <orgName type="division" n="Division 1">First Division</orgName>, for any duty the present emergency may require.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Now I would like to know by what authority <persName n="Sanford,Major-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Sanford,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major-General">Major General</roleName> <surname>Sanford</surname></persName>, or the <rs>Division</rs> <orgName n="Officers Board" type="board">Board of Officers</orgName>, has to offer the services of the <orgName type="mil" key="NYStateMilitia">New York State Militia</orgName> without the consent of each regiment, which, I know, has not been obtained; and I think there are many who would object to go so long as the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> persist in disfranchising the <rs>South</rs> of her rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>And I would like to ask if it would not be imprudent on the part of <persName n="Sanford,Major-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Sanford,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major-General">Major Gen.</roleName> <surname>Sanford</surname></persName>, under the present excited state of public feeling existing in the city, to order the military out of New York?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>It seems to me the action of <persName n="Sanford,Major-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Sanford,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major-General">Major General</roleName> <surname>Sanford</surname></persName> confirms what I have often seen in some of the New York papers, of his utter incapacity to fill the high position he now occupies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> Among a number of similar communications in the <orgName n="Journal of commerce" type="newspaper">Journal of Commerce</orgName>, we find the following from a member of the gallant &#x0022;<num value="7" type="ordinal">Seventh</num>:&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> <persName n="Sanford,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Sanford,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sanford</surname></persName> has offered the services of the <orgName type="division" n="Division 1">First Division</orgName> of the <rs>N. Y. S. Militia</rs> to the <rs>Governor</rs> of the <rs>State</rs>, should he be called upon to assist in maintaining the integrity of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Very patriotic &mdash; or very ambitious to see his name in the papers: hard to determine which.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Better wait till he receives orders to offer that which he has no authority of himself to grant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The <orgName type="division" n="Division 1">First Division</orgName> would no doubt be prompt to render any aid in their power to maintain the integrity of the <rs>Union</rs>, which is dear as life to most of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>But I, for <num value="1">one</num>, as an old member, would like to say that if the <dateStruct value="-03-4"><day reg="4">fourth</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct> should come round without proper concessions having been made &mdash; concessions just, lawful and constitutional, to allay the storm and guarantee security to every <num value="1">one</num> of the <name>States</name> of this Union--I would be happy to join the <orgName type="division" n="Division 1">First Division</orgName> and proceed to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> to stay the inauguration of the power which has caused the deplorable state of affairs now existing, till sufficient guarantee is given that the agitating causes will be ignored, and the rendering of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, as it has always been interpreted by the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></orgName>, be conceded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> A letter from New York to the <orgName n="Philadelphia Ledger" type="newspaper">Philadelphia Ledger</orgName>, says, on the same subject: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The city military are all in a ferment, owing to <persName n="Sanford,Major-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Sanford,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major-General">Major General</roleName> <surname>Sanford</surname></persName>'s tender of the <orgName type="division" n="Division 1">First Division</orgName> to <persName n="Morgan,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Morgan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Morgan</surname></persName>, in case an emergency should arise out of the crisis in our national affairs rendering their services desirable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>There can be no doubt that our citizen soldiery are, every man of them, loyal to the <rs>Union</rs>, but before any official pledge was given, committing them to take part in a civil war, there are not a few of them who think they should have been consulted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> This feeling probably finds the freest expression among the members of the celebrated <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 7">Seventh Regiment</orgName>, the officers of which will probably unite in an address to the <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major General</rs>, in the course of a few days, gently reminding him that they are citizens as well as soldiers, and have a &#x0022;will&#x0022; to be consulted in such cases, as well as orders to be obeyed. </p> </q><bibl n="Philadelphia Ledger"></bibl></cit> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The ideas and language interchanged among them, and to all who cause to address them, evinced almost barbaric simplicity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The majority of them exhibited a wonderfully stupid set of features.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/><num value="1">One</num> of them, however, the most intelligent fellow in the lot, gave quite satisfactory answers to most of the inquiries propounded to him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>The suit of types in which it is now equipped was manufactured in this city, at the foundry of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Walker,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00151" reg="mostcommon:Walker,R.,L.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Walker</surname></persName> &#x0026; <persName n="Pelouze,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00152" reg="mostcommon:Pelouze,nomatch:0"><surname>Pelouze</surname></persName>.</hi> It is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> ever manufactured south of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>This fact adds no little to the pride and pleasure that we always feel in presenting the <hi rend="smallcaps">Dispatch</hi> to its readers in a spick and span new suit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>We are sure our friends sympathize in this sentiment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/> The introduction of new types into the columns of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Dispatch,</hi> is an event of far too frequent occurrence to be as profitable as agreeable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>The large amount of its circulation subjects the types on which it is printed to such harsh and severe usage, that they are soon battered and worn so as to impair their good appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>Every experiment has been made to harden the type metal, in order to make it more durable; and though a great improvement has been made in it, still, in circulations such as ours, it is found that nothing can make it proof against the wear and tear of the powerful machinery it has to pass through at lightning speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>It is, nevertheless, a great satisfaction to us to renew our types and improve the <hi rend="smallcaps">Dispatch</hi> as often as that is necessary, and as much as it costs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/> Time was when daily lists in this city were numbered by hundreds, and then a font of types lasted somewhere about a decade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>The intervals of renewal were long, and the event, when it did come, was quite an excitement.--A famous veteran of the types in those days indulged himself upon such occasions in prolonged and devoted sprees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>Taking care to bring the paper out <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in the new dress, he placed the earliest copies in his hat, and hurried off to the restaurants to exhibit it to admiring crowds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>Toasting the types, the paper, the editors, the printers and the devil, he soon got a brick in his hat instead of the papers, and commenced a cruise (as he called it,) of a week or <num value="2">two</num>, which wound up with his being picked up foundered at sea, and towed home for overhauling and refitting.--Upon his reappearance, he was himself a type of the battered font, which had given place to the new. But times have changed, and the renewal of the dress of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Dispatch</hi> excites not half the notice such an event in other days occasioned. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/> The <hi rend="smallcaps">Dispatch</hi> has now, we suppose, in newspaper life, reached the period of adolescence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>It is in its <num value="11" type="ordinal">eleventh</num> year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>We used to speak of its youth and the smart appearance of the boy in his new suit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>That time so interesting to parents, has passed, and we look at him now in his maturity; and though the tender solicitude inspired by his earlier struggles in relieved by the matured life and solid position he has attained, we still regard him with a proper pride and delight in every improvement he displays.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>The reader will pardon, we are sure, thus much of egotism. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/> We take the occasion as fitting to thank our friends and the public in general for the favor so widely and liberally shown the <hi rend="smallcaps">Dispatch.</hi>--Its success has been as steady as the growth of thriving commercial communities, and now it exhibits a condition of prosperity unexampled by the <rs>Southern</rs> press.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>To the public, and to whatever of tact and industry we may possess, we are indebted for this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>We can only promise to continue our exertions to furnish the people with a really valuable newspaper and a fair and just journal, devoted to the prosperity and welfare of our own city and State, and true to the rights and honor of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>With these great causes we desire to prosper, and when they fail and fall, so may we! </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1610"/> On the night of <date value="12-28">the 28th of December,</date> was witnessed a most beautiful lunar bow, or rainbow, as it is commonly called, though there was no rain at the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1611"/>It was caused by the reflection and refraction of the rays of light upon the sleet-encrusted snow which covered the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1612"/>The moon, which was full the day previous, rose about <time value="7oclock">7 o'clock</time>, when the beautiful phenomenon commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1614"/>All the prismatic tints were very vivid, though the red, violet and green were the brightest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1615"/>It gave a pale orange tint to the whole eastern part of the firmament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1616"/>The radius of the bow seemed about <num value="30">30</num> deg. There was a bright streak of white light, as broad as the moon, extending from the horizon up through the moon perpendicularly, apparently <num value="20">20</num> deg. in length.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1617"/>Another streak of like color and dimensions ran horizontally across through the moon &mdash; thus forming a beautiful and perfect cross, which has given rise to various conjectures connected with the millennium, and the <rs>Pope</rs>'s removal to <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>. </p>
