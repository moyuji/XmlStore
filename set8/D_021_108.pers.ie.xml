<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>Before, however, we discuss the views of Government on the point immediately under discussion, it will be necessary to correct a misapprehension which has tended to confuse <num value="2">two</num> questions very distinguishable from each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>It appears to have been imagined both my Lords Be <persName n="Grey,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00079" reg="mostcommon:Grey,nomatch:0"><surname>Grey</surname></persName> and <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Ellencerouge</foreName></persName>, and to have been, indeed, generally assumed, that the conclusion to which the public instinctively jumped after the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> experiment, was simply a <unclear></unclear> that forts were <unclear></unclear> because iron plated, ships could repel shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>But that was not the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>It was only by accident that the question of forts was introduced at all. What was concluded from the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> battle was that wooden ships, however strong or numerous, were barely helpless against even extemporized ironsides and that it was consequently within the power of any nation to construct in the course of a few months, and at a very moderate cost, half a dozen vessels which would be more than a <unclear></unclear> the whole navy on which we relied for protection.
