<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Our lines extend across this valley, which is drained by <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>, now very much swollen, and, as you may imagine, the condition of the men, especially those in the trenches and on picket, is exceedingly uncomfortable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>None of them have more, than <num value="1">one</num> blanket, and nearly are without shelter of any kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/><address><street n="Long street">Long street</street></address>'s corps is somewhat better off, his men having provided themselves with <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> flies, India-rubbers, &#x0026;c., at <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName> and other battle-fields. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>It is not probable that there will be an adequate supply of either clothing, shoes, or hats, or even of provisions, unless we recover <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>; but the chief want, as already stated, will be blankets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Arrangements were made sometime since to procure supplies of clothing and shoes, and if our ventures are attended by auspicious gales the army will be able to get through the winter with such help as the people at home can, and doubtless will reader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Their response to the call made upon them last winter was the sublimest incident of the war, and will be recorded in history as it has already been in &#x0022;the books&#x0022; which are kept beyond the sun, and in which all our accounts, whether for good or evil, are entered with an unerring hand. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> As in the past, so at this time, I would address my appeal chiefly to the women of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The men have always done their duty in this respect, but the women have done more than their duty &mdash; they have helped their husbands, fathers, and brothers to do theirs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>True, they do not enter the field, nor brave the clash of battle, nor use cannon, <persName><foreName>Minnie</foreName></persName> rifles, and swords; and yet the vast army of heroic women who have given their hands and hearts to the cause have done their parts as well as their brave brothers in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The weapons they employ are the needle, the spinning-wheel, and the loom, words of encouragement to the weary and faint hearted, and kind and generous deeds in the hospital and by the wayside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>With these arms they have done as much to defeat our wicked enemies as an army of resolute men. If they have not met these enemies in battle, they have met them at the loom and around the couch of the wounded and sick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>If they have not gone to the field in person, they have ever been there in spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>In every blanket they have given to the soldier, in every pair of socks they have put upon his bleeding feet, in every garment they have woven for his manly limbs, they have been present in the hour of battle, and have given blows for the freedom of their race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>It is to these heroines of the needle, the loom, and the spinning wheel, that brave veterans who have for <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> stood between them and danger now turn for relief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Shall their appeal be made in vain?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Not as long as there is a blanket, a yard of carpeting or of cloth, or a sheep-skin, that can be spared. </p>

The abuses which followed this paper blockade &mdash; the capture or interruption of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> vessels bound on voyages to the ports declared to be blockaded &mdash; led to a series of retaliatory measures on the part of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Government, and, combined with other secondary causes, all springing out of this grand <num value="1">one</num>, to the war of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>.

Subsequently, by the treaty of <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>, in <dateStruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct>, this right of paper blockade was formally abandoned, and the doctrine established that a blockade, to be respected, must be <hi rend="italics">effectual.</hi> <persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00175" reg="mostcommon:Russell,nomatch:0"><surname>Russell</surname></persName> himself afterwards put a gloss upon this clause of the treaty, which rendered its meaning so plain as to avoid all possibility of misinterpretation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>An effectual blockade, according to him, is <num value="1">one</num> which not more than <num value="3">three</num> vessels have succeeded in evading.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>A blockade evaded by a greater number of vessels is not effectual. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/> That portion of the world which trusted to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>'s good faith and love of fair play, was utterly unable to account for the supineness of her foreign secretary, in permitting the present blockade to stand without a protest, when it so evidently wanted the conditions necessary to render it legal in his opinion, until it was enlightened by his late speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>It is evident <hi rend="italics">now</hi> that, apart from a disgraceful fear of <persName n="Adams,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00176" reg="mostcommon:Adams,nomatch:0"><surname>Adams</surname></persName> and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, who seem to dictate the foreign policy of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> at this moment &mdash; he is actuated by a desire to resume the old claim of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>--the right to establish paper blockades of whole coasts &mdash; and that he thinks this a good opportunity to induce the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> to abandon their opposition to it. <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, he tells us, herself established a paper blockade over <measure n="2000miles" type="distance">two thousand miles</measure> of coast, and having done so she has no right to find fault with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> for doing the same thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>He seems to have forgotten, or rather he does not choose to remember, that at a subsequent period <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, by a solemn treaty, renounced all right to establish any such blockade in future, and evidently designs upon the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> opportunity to ignore the treaty, and reassert the right. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/> With regard to the iron-clads it is even more evident that his whole course has been dictated by <persName n="Adams,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00177" reg="mostcommon:Adams,nomatch:0"><surname>Adams</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>Now, these vessels belong to <name>French</name> subjects, who have already paid for them in part, and it remains to be seen in what light the matter will be regarded by the <rs>Emperor</rs> of the <rs>French</rs>, who is understood to have no such scruples as those which harass the <rs>English</rs> foreign secretary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>The latter insists that they shall prove their destination before they be allowed to leave the <rs>Mersey</rs>, and it is understood that a ship-of-war lies in that river ready to overhaul them whenever they attempt to go to sea without leave asked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>But suppose they should say that they are <name>French</name> property, and bound for a French port.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>What right can <persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00178" reg="mostcommon:Russell,nomatch:0"><surname>Russell</surname></persName> have to inquire into their farther destination, and how will the <rs>French Emperor</rs> relish such inquiry if it be made?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>It is clearly enough for the owners to prove that they are <name>French</name> subjects &mdash; that their &#x0022;destination&#x0022; is a French port.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>Any farther destination is a matter for the <rs>Emperor</rs>, not the <name>Parliament</name> and courts of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> to consider. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/> So far it is clear enough that the builders of these vessels have proceeded according to law. If &#x0022;further measures&#x0022; be resorted to by <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName>, he will evidently violate the neutrality of which he makes such violent profession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>He will be assisting the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> at our expense; for, while he forbids us to purchase ships-of-war, he allows them to buy and carry off as many arms and munitions as they have money to pay for. A neutral cannot refuse to <num value="1">one</num> belligerent what he accords to another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>The moment he does so he ceases to be a neutral, and becomes a party to the war.--It is a principle of international law that neutrals shall not furnish troops, arms, or ammunition to either of the belligerents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>This principle has always been disregarded since the commencement of this war. We are in no condition to go to war.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/> The explanation of <persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00180" reg="mostcommon:Russell,nomatch:0"><surname>Russell</surname></persName>'s conduct lies in a nutshell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>He wishes them to subjugate us because we are slaveholders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>His speech betrays the operation of these <num value="2">two</num> motives as clearly as if he had declared it in so many words. --That he is our deadly enemy, cannot be concealed or denied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>That he is the tool of <persName n="Adams,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00181" reg="mostcommon:Adams,nomatch:0"><surname>Adams</surname></persName>, is quite as evident.
