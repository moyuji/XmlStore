<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>On the latter were many very fine anchors, of different sizes and shapes, from the small grapnel and boat kedge to the heavy ship's anchor, weighing near <measure n="8000l." type="pounds"><num value="8000">eight thousand</num> pounds</measure>. From the spars of the schooners purchases were rigged, and with these the heavy weights were swung out of the hold and floated ashore upon lighters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>At the end of <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> very little was left upon any of the vessels that would be of service to us in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, the bare hulls only remaining.--From the troops on shore we had frequent intimation of an advance on the part of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and fearing they might come upon us before the work was completed, the guns were hauled ashore and put in battery upon the bluff, in a position commanding both the river and the opposite side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Only <num value="1">one</num> smooth bore <num value="32">thirty-two</num> was left upon the decks.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> Monday was a hot day, but towards evening it became cool and pleasant, and I determined to go ashore to enjoy a twilight walk through the desolated town of <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>After over <measure n="48hours" type="date">forty- eight hours</measure> confinement to the hard and heated decks the turf felt unusually pleasant, and I sauntered up to the village, feeling very comfortable and good natured &mdash; as <num value="1">one</num> feels after a day's labor, when he contemplates his work well done at night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Hardly had I reached the precincts of the town before the sound of musketry on the opposite shore attracted my attention, and soon after heard the cry of &#x0022;<rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.&#x0022;Hastening down to the river banks I saw that, sure enough, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had come--<num value="2">two</num> regiments of cavalry being there visible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>All our troops had been withdrawn from <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName> but <num value="1">one</num> regiment &mdash; the <orgName type="regiment" key="AL48">48th Alabama</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>From this about <num value="100">one hundred</num> men had been sent across the river to protect commissary trains foraging in <persName><roleName n="King">King</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>With this small force <persName n="Hardwicke,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Hardwicke,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Hardwicke</surname></persName> immediately engaged the enemy, holding him in check until the wagons could be crossed and the boats free to receive his men. Protected by a small patch of woods and firing rapidly, <persName n="Hardwicke,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Hardwicke,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Hardwicke</surname></persName> probably deceived the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> as to his numbers, for he kept them back until nearly dark, and then safely embarked his men at the ferry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>While in the boat they received a volley from a squadron of cavalry; but, strange to say, not a man was injured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Our loss amounted to <num value="1">one</num> private and <num value="2">two</num> quartermasters captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had some <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4" type="killed">four killed</measure>.--<num value="1">One</num> of the dead was a captain in the <rs>Michigan</rs> cavalry, our men getting his sword, watch, and several letters from his wife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/><num value="1">One</num> private lay dead beside him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> At dark the firing ceased, but we could hear the rumble of artillery as a battery rundown the shore and took a position opposite our steamers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>We knew then that a fight was certain in the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>During the night everything that then remained on the gunboats was taken on shore, and the battery on the bluff prepared for action, which we fell confident would begin at &#x0022;the crack of day.&#x0022; After the ammunition and arms were put in a place of safety and the personal baggage &#x0022;sent to the rear,&#x0022; the men lay down by their guns to catch a few hours'sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>It was a singularly beautiful night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>I had worked hard all day, with the rest, and through half the night; but about <time value="12oclock">12 o'clock</time> nearly all were in the land of dreams, and I sat down to have a comfortable pipe before retiring to the soft spot of ground picked out for a bed. We were upon a small bluff some <measure n="50feet" type="distance">fifty feet</measure> high.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Below the river flowed smoothly on, shimmering in the light of the gibbous moon, while above it, just resting upon the tops of the trees hung a thin white veil of mist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Stretching along the stream, curving gracefully southward, was a dark line of woods, throwing a black shadow upon the water and sending out from every tree the night cry of the katy-did and sawyer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Disturbed watch-dogs in the neighboring farmyards barked to each other or the moon, and cows lowed in the meadows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>But above all the sounds of the night was a single hootowl in the lonely branches crying, who shouted &#x0022;murder&#x0022; to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> foe beyond the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>An hour of revery and then to rest &mdash; the bivouac fires smouldered in their ashes, and only the guard lent ears to the wakeful sentinel of the woods. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> Early <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, before the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line of daylight was visible, I went over to <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName> to procure some necessaries in case of an action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The place was entirely deserted, <persName n="Hardwicke,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Hardwicke,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Hardwicke</surname></persName>, with commendable industry, having removed every family the night previous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>There was nothing to be had and I turned back again to our boats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The firing commenced, however, before the distance was made, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> having opened with <num value="2">two</num> guns at the distance of a mile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>This challenge was promptly responded to by <persName n="Hudgins,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Hudgins,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut.</roleName> <surname>Hudgins</surname></persName>, who returned <num value="2">two</num> shots with admirable aim, the shells exploding exactly at the enemy's guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>These shots are said to have done more damage than all the rest during the day's firing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>If the report of a citizen be true, a staff officer was killed, a man wounded, a gun injured, and <num value="1">one</num> horse disabled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Afterwards the firing became general, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> opening with <num value="4">four</num> other pieces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Unfortunately, our best gun, a splendid <persName n="Parrott,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Parrott,nomatch:0"><surname>Parrott</surname></persName>, was thrown down after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shot, and could be used no more; for it was impossible to remount it under the heavy fire of rifle shell and spherical case poured in upon us. The <num value="2">two</num> smaller guns remained, and these replied leisurely to the rapid shots of the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> Probably perceiving their fire had no effect, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> moved down abreast of us, at a distance of about <measure n="1200yards" type="distance">twelve hundred yards</measure>. Here they fired at least <num value="2">two</num> shell a minute for a hour, <persName n="Hudgins,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Hudgins,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut.</roleName> <surname>Hudgins</surname></persName> firing half a dozen, perhaps, during the time.--Then there was a lull for a few moments, when our guns were opened, firing rapidly until they began again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>This was kept up for over <measure n="4hours" type="date">four hours</measure>. The steamers were an especial target, and they were frequently hit, the rifle balls going completely through the upper works, and a shell occasionally exploding in them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>As near as we could estimate, over <num value="500">five hundred</num> shot and shell had been thrown at us, when the enemy became tired of the fun and ceased firing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>We watched them as they limbered up and started <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> on the retreat, and <persName n="Hudgins,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Hudgins,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut.</roleName> <surname>Hudgins</surname></persName>, by way of a parting salute, sent <persName n="Gardner,Midshipman,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Gardner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Midshipman">Midshipman</roleName> <surname>Gardner</surname></persName> to give them the compliments of the old <num value="32">thirty two</num>, still on the decks of the <rs>Satellite</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The final shot accelerated their retreat, and almost before its echoes had died away all had disappeared behind the hills beyond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Not a particle of damage was done us during the bombardment &mdash; not a man was injured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The <rs>Satellite</rs> had some <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <num value="20">twenty</num> shots in her, but none of them injured the machinery in any way or did any damage to the hull.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>The wheelhouse was somewhat splintered, and the <rs>Captain</rs>'s room was riddled; otherwise she was in no way the worse for the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Had she been in motion I doubt if she would have been struck at all. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> After a few hours rest the men again loaded the wagons with the material on shore and started them on to <placeName reg="Milford, Worcester, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2050128">Milford</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>That army dominates all the country and all the people within its range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>Any offer of terms made by any man or men within that range, in opposition to that army is simply nothing, for the present, because such man or men have no power whatever to enforce their side of the compromise, if <num value="1">one</num> were made with them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/> To illustrate: Suppose a refugee from the <rs>South</rs> and the peace men of the <rs>North</rs> get together and frame and proclaim a compromise embracing the restoration of the <rs>Union</rs>, in what way can that compromise be used to keep <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00040" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> out of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>? <orgName n="army"><persName n="Meade,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00041" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Meade</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> can keep <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00042" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> out of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, and I think can ultimately drive it out of existence, but no paper compromise to which the controllers of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00043" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> are not agreed can at all affect that army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>In an effort at such compromise we would waste time which the enemy would improve to our disadvantage, and that would be all. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/> A compromise, to be effective, must be made either with those who control the army or with the people <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> liberated from the domination of that army by the success of our army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>Now, allow me to assure you that no word or intimation from the rebel army, or from any of the men controlling it, in relation to any peace compromise has ever come to my knowledge or belief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>All charges or intimations to the contrary are deceptive and groundless, and I promise you that if any such proposition shall hereafter come it shall not be rejected and kept secret from you. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/> I freely acknowledge myself to be the servant of the people according to the bond of service &mdash; the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">United States Constitution</rs>--and that as such I am responsible to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>But, to be plain, you are dissatisfied with me about the negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>Quite likely there is a difference of opinion between you and myself upon that subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>I certainly wish that all men could be free, while you, I suppose, do not. Yet, I have neither adopted nor proposed any measure which is not consistent with even your views, provided you are for the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>I suggested compensated emancipation, to which you replied that you wished not to be taxed to buy negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>But I had not asked you to be taxed to buy negroes, except in such a way as to save you from greater taxation, to save the <rs>Union</rs> exclusively by other means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>You dislike the emancipation proclamation, and, perhaps, you want to have it retracted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>You say it is unconstitutional.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>I think differently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>I think that the <rs>Constitution</rs> invests its <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in- Chief</rs> with the law of war in time of war. The most that can be said &mdash; if so much &mdash; is that slaves are property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>Is there, has there ever been, any question that by the law of war the property both of enemies and friends may be taken when needed?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>And is it not needed whenever taken it helps us or hurts the enemy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>Armies, the world over, destroy the enemy's property when they cannot use it, and even destroy their own to keep it from the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>Civilized belligerents do all in their power to help themselves or hurt the enemy, except a few things recorded as barbarous or cruel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>Among the exceptions are the massacre of vanquished foes and non-combatants, male and female. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/> But the proclamation as a law is valid or is not valid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>If it is not valid it needs no retraction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>If it is valid it cannot be retracted any more than the dead can be brought to life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>Some of you profess to think that its retraction would operate favorably for the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>Why better after the retraction than before the issue?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>There was more than a year and <num value="0.5">a half</num> for trial to suppress the rebellion before the proclamation was issued, the last <measure n="100days" type="date">one hundred days</measure> of which passed under explicit notice it was coming unless averted by those in revolt returning to their allegiance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/> The war has certainly progressed as favorably for us since the issue of the proclamation as before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>I know, as fully as <num value="1">one</num> can know the opinions of others, that some of the commanders of our armies in the field who have given us our most important victories, believe that the emancipation policy and the aid of the colored troops constitutes the heaviest blows yet dealt to the rebellion; and that at least <num value="1">one</num> of those important successes could not have been achieved when it was, but for the aid of the black soldiers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/> Among the commanders holding these views are some who have never had any affinity with what is called Abolitionism, or with <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> polities, but who hold them purely as military opinions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>I submit their opinions as being entitled to some weight against the objections often urged that emancipation and the arming of the blacks are unwise as military measures, and were not adopted as such in good faith. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/> You say that you will not fight to free negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>Some of them seem to be willing to fight for you; but no matter, fight you, then, exclusively to save the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>I issued the proclamation on purpose to aid you in saving the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>Whenever you shall have conquered all resistance to the <rs>Union</rs>, if I shall urge you to continue fighting, it will be an apt time then for you to declare that you will not fight to free negroes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/> I thought that in your struggle for the <rs>Union</rs>, to whatever extent the negro should cease helping the enemy, to that extent it weakens the enemy in his resistance to you. Do you think differently?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>I thought that whatever negroes can be got to do as soldiers, leaves just so much less for white soldiers to do in saving the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/> Does it appear otherwise to you?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>But negroes, like other people, act upon motives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>Why should they do anything for us if we will do nothing for them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>If they stake their lives for us they must be prompted by the strongest motive, even the promise of freedom; and the promise being made must be kept. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/> The signs look better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>I shall, therefore, this morning tender my resignation as such.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>Before doing which, however, I tender you my resignation as your presiding officer, that you may at once proceed to fill my place. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/> Elected to fill the vacancy occasioned by the death of the lamented <rs>Yancey</rs>, whose eloquence and perseverance in the cause of Southern rights contributed more largely than the efforts of any other man to bring about our separation from the old <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>, and to whom, up to the period of secession, as well as upon the question of secession itself, it is well known that I was opposed in my political views, it may not be deemed inappropriate to briefly state my views as to what course the <rs>Government</rs> and the people of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, in the present trying emergencies of the country, should pursue. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/> The question of secession is of the things that are past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>It has become a part of the country's history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>Future historians, other men, and other times, will pass a more impartial verdict as to its wisdom and its policy than the present generation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>But it is for the present generation to decide its own political status.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>It matters not whether our separation was right or wrong, wise or unwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>The alternative now presented to us is, to press forward, arms in hand, until we shall have achieved an honorable and glorious independence, or to tamely and basely submit to the lowest political and social degradation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>However ardently peace may be desired, there is not, I trust, amongst us, or in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, <num value="1">one</num> who would accept peace on any other than honorable terms.--Who would, for the sake of peace, be willing to see the <rs>Southern</rs> people consigned to political degradation and doomed to a social, equality with our slaves?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>We are told by our oppressors that no terms of peace will be accepted but upon the unconditional and immediate abolition of slavery, and confiscation of rebel property.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>Let us bear in mind &#x0022;the race is not always to the swift nor the battle to the strong. &#x0022;Relying upon the justness of our cause, and imploring the favor of <name n="God" type="God">Divine Providence</name>, let us press forward to conquer an honorable peace or to honorable graves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/> My connection with the legislation of the <rs>State</rs> is now about being terminated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>Our parting brings many sad reflections.-- We part, some of us, never to meet again either in the halls of legislation or the common walks of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>We part with many, dark and threatening clouds hanging over the prospects of our beloved country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>Let me in this her hour of adversity, exhort you that each of us shall pledge to the other his life, his fortune, and his sacred honor in defence of her holy cause. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/> --The enemies of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00107" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,A.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> have sometimes taken occasion to say that papers presented to the world with his signature attached, were not written by him. We think no man will be found of a nature so skeptical as to doubt that this letter is genuine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>It has a flat-boat, rail-splitting, whiskey-drinking odor about it which allows of no mistake with regard to its origin.--We doubt whether any other man in his dominions could have written exactly such a letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>To find <num value="1">one</num> who could come nearest to it, we should be compelled to pass in review the whole army of flat-boatmen that once made the <rs>Mississippi</rs> and the <rs>Ohio</rs> vocal with ribald jests and obscene songs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/> In the days of the <rs>Union</rs> it was fashionable to defend every infringement of the <rs>Constitution</rs> by reference to the general welfare clause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>That was an enactment so wide and indefinite in its signification that it was supposed to cover every usurpation and justify every violence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>It was the entrance by which <persName n="Adams,,John,Quincy,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00108" reg="default:Adams,John,Quincy,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>Quincy</foreName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName> said he could drive a wagon and team through the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00109" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,A.,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> scorns to take shelter under any law of indefinite signification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>He is a military despot, and he regards his sword knot as a better warrant for his actions than any law that ever was enacted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>He claims the right to emancipate our slaves, although their possession is guaranteed by the very Constitution, for the restoration of which he professes to be now fighting &mdash; under his authority as <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs> of the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> and Navy of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>This is the boldest avowal of the existence of a military despotism we have yet seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>It places the property of every man in Yankeedom, as well as the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, absolutely at his disposal, whenever he may think proper to denounce such man as an enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>The most striking feature of the claim is, that it utterly abolishes the <rs>Constitution</rs> for the sake of preserving it. He and his party still regard, or affect to regard, the people of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> as citizens of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>If so, they are under the protection of the laws of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>The laws of the <rs>Union</rs> prescribe trial by jury for the crime of treason, and condemnation only upon proof of guilt satisfactory to such jury, they take especial care to repudiate all attainder of blood, and forfeiture of every kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>Yet here is a President who undertakes, by a simple proclamation, to do what the <rs>Constitution</rs> does not allow to be done in any case, under any circumstances. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/> His rule of warfare would have suited Timour or Genghis Khan, and was extensively acted upon by those enlightened models.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>But it has been repudiated by every <name>Christian</name> people for <measure n="200years" type="date">two hundred years</measure>. The last that followed it was <persName n="Turenne,Marshal,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00110" reg="mostcommon:Turenne,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Marshal">Marshal</roleName> <surname>Turenne</surname></persName>, when he ravaged the <name>Palatinate</name> with fire and sword; by which act he doubtless damned his own soul, and earned for himself the execration of posterity throughout the civilized world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00111" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,A.,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, however, but avows the principle on which his plunderers have all along been acting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>Establish the principle that it is lawful to destroy everything which can be useful to an enemy, and you justify the utter destruction of every country into which an enemy may penetrate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>Houses, mills, barns, growing crops, cattle, horses, sheep, <rs n="agricultural implements" type="product">agricultural implements</rs>, cities, towns, villages, everything which can support life or be the subject of property, is useful to an enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>We thus find the ruler of a people, calling themselves free and enlightened, enunciating doctrines which would disgrace the <name>Sepoys</name>, and which even in the <rs>East</rs> have never been acted on since the day when Hyde Ally destroyed the <rs>Carnatic</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/> The letter closes with the most humiliating confession, or rather avowal, that ever covered a nation with shame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>The mighty Empire of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Doodle, numbering <num value="20000000">20,000,000</num> of stationary inhabitants, and an untold number of immigrants, after trying in vain for <measure n="2.5years" type="date">two years and a half</measure> to crush a people not <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> part as numerous as themselves, is indebted, according to its chief, for its most important victory to the valor of negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>But for these negroes, we are allowed to infer, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> would have been driven like whipped hounds, yelling and screaming, before the <rs>Confederates</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>If there is a more shameful avowal upon record we never saw it. It proves exactly what we have always said that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> is inferior to the negro, and if <persName n="Gibbon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00112" reg="mostcommon:Gibbon,nomatch:0"><surname>Gibbon</surname></persName> had known anything of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> he would never have said that the negro race is inferior to the white race, without putting in a salvo for the infinite degradation of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Doodle. </p> </div3>

<head type="nobreak" rend="smallcaps">The Financial question.</head> 
<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/> --We observe with great pleasure that a city contemporary announces a considerable tumble in gold, or, which is the same thing, a considerable appreciation in Confederate money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>This change has been attributed to various causes; by some to the expected legislation of the approaching session against the brokers; by others to reviving confidence in the soundness of our currency, &#x0026;c. Now, we do not believe that there has ever been any general mistrust of the soundness of the currency, notwithstanding considerable alarm has been occasioned by its immense and continued expansion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>We choose, therefore, to attribute this appreciation of the currency to the confidence which the public feel in the expected operation of the <rs>Confederate</rs> tax, and the hope that it will bring in a vast amount of the outstanding Treasury notes; to the tax <hi rend="italics">in kind,</hi> that will save the necessity of fresh issues for the purchase of provisions for the army; and, in fine, to the general belief that the volume of the currency is in a fair way to be greatly and permanently curtailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>We hold it to be self- evident that how much soever the currency may have suffered from the drain of gold employed in the smuggling trade, and from other sources of depletion, it has all been as nothing compared to the rapid expansion of the circulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>Let that be curtailed, and things will return as nearly to their normal state as is possible in a time of war and invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>If such benefit has already been derived from mere anticipation of the effects to be produced by the measures adopted for reducing the circulation, what may not be expected from the actual consummation of those measures?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>The letters of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> and the report of the <name>Register</name> have no doubt also <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> had their effect, showing, as they do, that although the circulation is still enormous, it has already been greatly reduced. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/> Nevertheless, there is still great room for reduction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>We are still cursed with a currency, overwhelmingly redundant, and it is of importance that it should be reduced to the proper limits, consistent with an active, vigorous, and continued prosecution of the war. We can hardly be brought to believe that the present measures, although highly beneficial, can fully effect the object, and it will be for Congress to devise some other still more rapid and efficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>A forced loan is not to be thought of, although it would probably be the most efficient and sudden.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>To say that notes of certain descriptions not paid in before a certain day would not thereafter be received in payment of public dues would bring such notes in <sic> in</sic> a perfect deluge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>But this will not do, because it amounts to repudiation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>Our own opinion is, that it would be best to submit to a discount on the bonds offered for sale, and thereby sell off a large quantity at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>Sales at par or for a premium look well upon paper; but they are limited, and operate but slowly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>The great object is to curtail the redundancy of the circulation, and this we take it can only be done by going into the market with these bonds in the same way that other stocks go into market, and selling them for what they will bring when exposed to sale in large quantities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>We merely throw out these suggestions for the inspection of those in whose hands is the issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>The currency seems already to be rapidly improving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>Gold (to use the common expression) has already fallen from <num value="16">16</num> to <num value="9">9</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>It cannot become entirely healthy all at once &mdash; probably not during war times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>But it is incumbent upon Government and people to do everything in their power at least to prevent a relapse. </p> </div3>
