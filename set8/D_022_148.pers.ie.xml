I have hitherto avoided troubling this <name>House</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Content to be a listener, without any other participation in its proceedings than to oppose my solemn individual negative against measures which my conscience and my principles would not approve, I have said nothing Indeed, sir, I have not had the heart to rise here and speak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>A glance at this <name>Hall</name>, of itself, has been enough to present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>When I look around and see <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of the <rs>Union</rs> unrepresented here, and find myself in a body, though purporting to be <num value="1">one</num> branch of the <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName>, really in fact but a fragmentary part of it, my heart sinks within me. It appears to be a sectional body &mdash; a gathering of the representatives of a sectional party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>With these feelings, and with this spirit, I have until now avoided participating in debate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> Besides, sir, during the earlier period of this session, disaster had accompanied the efforts of the <rs>Federal</rs> arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>I felt that the hour of defeat was not a fit <num value="1">one</num> in which to serve to awaken the great soul of the <rs>North</rs> to thoughts of peace; I felt that something was due to the sense of mortification, something to the natural desire to retrieve the shame of discomfiture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>I hope, too, that when victory should perch upon our banners, others than myself would seize the occasion to urge a plea in behalf of peaceable measures; and that this Government itself, feeling secure and strong enough to be magnanimous, would take the lead and be the pioneer in opening a path for the settlement of our difficulties without further recourse to bloodshed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>I even hoped that the leaders of the now dominant party, moved by the sore distress which has visited our country, would relent from the stern rigor of their doctrine of subjugation, and, in the flush of triumph, would lean a little towards a gentler policy than that which they have hitherto championed with so much zeal and with so little forbearance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> I hoped in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The triumph came: a long train of successes has relieved the <rs>North</rs> from its humiliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The Government claims now to stand as a rock against which the tempest of opposition must waste itself in futile efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The partisans of the ultra was party laugh to scorn the idea that any effectual resistance can be offered to the onward march of our triumphant armies, and yet no single effort has been made in these Congressional Halls to stay the effusion of blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>It has been left for me, powerless as I am, to speak the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> conciliatory word in behalf of my suffering countrymen.--And I do it, sir, in the hope that others, more capable, will not be too much engrossed with the lust of conquest and the pride of victory to follow my example. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> Sir, it is an effaceable reproach to those either deluded or wicked men who, in the <rs>North</rs>, by their unwearied agitation of abolition schemes, have stirred the embers of this strife; it is an eternal reproach to them that, through defeat and victory, throughout every phase of this unhappy struggle, with the groans of their distressed and tortured country smiting upon their ears, they have clung, and still cling, with unpitying pertinacity, and even with ferocity, to the doctrine which has been the germ of all the mischief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>With the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> exulting shouts of Federal victories they set up the echoing cry of emancipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>With all the energy of fanaticism, with all the subtle arts and intrigues of scheming demagogues, with all the appliances of cunning, intellect, and patronage at their command, even at this eventful crisis, when every <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> brain should be at work to bring about a fair and honorable peace, they have no thought, no hope, no duty but to propagate their creed, extending its influence into every nook and cranny of the land, and poisoning the atmosphere of these sacred halls with its interminable discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Openly and in secret by the agency of the press, the pulpit, and the political rostrum, in the camp, in the city, and in the open field, they are spreading the cognation; they are inoculating the country with this moral pestilence which has already brought us where we are, at the very brink of the grave of our nationality. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> Sir, to these societies of abolitionism will be traced hereafter whatever of evil has befallen, or may be fall, our country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>They are building its sepulchre with the bones of their slaughtered countrymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>I do believe there are gentlemen within my vision now whose sworn purpose, whose <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> desire, paramount even to the preservation of Republicanism, is emancipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>They and their disciples <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> threw the apple of discord.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>They <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> applied the torch, and are now more busy than ever with throwing fresh fuel to the flame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Should history ever trace, which <name n="God" type="God">God</name> forbid, the record of this country's ruin, that page will seem the strangest to those that read which shall tell of the madness and wickedness of the arch- fanatics of abolitionism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>In the dark recesses of the temple of infamy, the gloomiest niches will bear the inscription of their names. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> Sir, I counsel none but a moral interference with the work of these mischief makers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>I would not have even fanaticism deprived of the right of free speech, nor would I, in any emergency, advocate the slightest infringement by the <rs>Government</rs> upon the liberty of the press.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Let them sow the seeds of their infamous doctrine broadcast over the land.--Whatever may be the danger, I will not countenance the greater danger of establishing a dictatorship over the thoughts of my fellow countrymen. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> But if the abominable theme must be brought into the council chambers of the nation, for the sake of decency, if not of justice, let it be at a more seasonable time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>If there remains <num value="1">one</num> Union man at the <rs>South</rs>, let us remember that he is unrepresented here; that the subject of slavery particularly concerns him, and that it is ungenerous and unjust, if not cowardly, to take advantage of his absence of representation to push forward measures in regard to the local institutions of his section &mdash; measures against which, were he present, he would give his earnest opposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>It will quench whatever remains of Union feeling in the <rs>South</rs>, if it has not already done so. It will destroy the last hope of a reconstruction of the <rs>Union</rs> on a friendly basis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>It will prove what has been so often intimated, that-the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> idea of the dominant party in the <rs>North</rs> is active and unwavering antagonism to slavery, and a fixed purpose to legislate it out of the land at all hazards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Is it with that theory advanced that we are to conquer a peace?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Sir, we are flinging away the last chances of reconciliation as recklessly as madmen cast their treasures into the sea. The agitation of the subject has been the country's bane at every period of its history; its discussion at this crisis is desperate self- destruction. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> Is it while the magazine is beneath us and about us, bursting with the agencies of ruin, that we must choose to sport with the flaming torch of the incendiary?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Sir, until our beloved country shall be saved, the word <q>&#x0022;emancipation&#x0022;</q> should by common consent, be banished from the language of debate in this assemblage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>It is a spell which has wrought enough already of desolation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>It is a hellish formula of incantation, which has conjured up the fiends of discord and civil war; and it never was so potent in its evil tendencies as now, when it is being passed, like the breath of the plague, from mouth to mouth, in the council chambers of the country it has ruined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>It should be spoken in a whisper and with a prayer linked to it, as a thing that brings a curse and spreads a pestilence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>I despair of my country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>I despair of ever living once more in a blessed Union of fraternal States, when I hear all around me the utterance of that ruin-breeding word, <q>&#x0022;emancipation,&#x0022;</q> mingling with the shouts of battle, the fierce hurrahs of triumph over fallen brothers, and the groans of our dying countrymen. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> Sir, if in place of making the negro question a subject matter of debate, this Congress would take into earnest, solemn consideration some expedient for securing peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>I do believe that success would crown our efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>If they would enter upon that task, not with hearts embittered and intellects swayed by sectional antipathies and untimely mock philanthropies, but with all their souls devoted to that <num value="1">one</num> sacred purpose &mdash; the reconstruction of the <rs>Union</rs> and our redemption from civil war; if they would do this, in the spirit of conciliation, of forgiveness, of tolerance, of brotherhood, and kindly feeling, it is my conviction that before the close of this eventful session the preliminaries of a peace would be arranged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>But while, with the obstinacy of a blind fanatic; and the instinct of a brutal gladiator, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> object is to promulgate a party read, and the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> to crush an opponent and wear the badge of victory, I see no fairer prospect than, at some distant period, reached through seas of blood and heaps of carnage, the forced submission of a crushed and devastated section, and the equally unhappy spectacle of a Government triumphant, but exhausted by its triumph, detested by a moiety of those sovereignties that gave it birth, and gazing with horror and remorse upon the desolation it has wrought. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> Sir, it is not my intention to vent reproaches, even where I believe them best deserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>I have risen to enter my protest against the discussion, in this Chamber, of any anti-slavery scheme whatever at this crisis, and to offer an earnest appeal to this Congress that its legislation shall embrace every means of securing an immediate peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>If, as the <rs>Government</rs> claims, the <rs>Confederate</rs> cause in hopeless, the leaders of the secession movement cannot be ignorant of the fact; and knowing it, they will be naturally inclined to lend a willing car to whatever proper overtures this Government may present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>At some period of this struggle there must be negotiation; it must be resorted to sooner or later; why not now? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> It is because pride forbids that we should be the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to outstretch the hand of conciliation?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Heaven forefend that <num value="1000">thousands</num> of human lives and a country's welfare should depend upon so false a principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>It is because the <rs>South</rs> has not been sufficiently punished, humbled and subdued?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Then let us confess that chastisement and renascent are the objects of </p> <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/> this war. Is it because the anti-slavery movement has not yet received a sufficient impetus?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>If so, go tell it to the armies that have won your victories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Make abolition the war cry. Place a banner with that device in the vannard, and hire those armies on to conquest with it &mdash; if you can. Your soldiers would send the treacherous ensign into shreds, and would march to their homes with the same alacrity that they pushed on with it to the battle-field. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/> What, then, is the cause that withholds negotiation?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>You will not parley with armed treason. --But you have parleyed with armed treason, if that be the word; parleyed for the mere convenience of an exchange of prisoners, and other purposes to mitigate the grievances of war.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> Let us suppose that the <rs>South</rs> is anxious to embrace an opportunity of return, and is withheld from making advances by doubts as to the intentions of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>It is not right that we should confer with them, that those doubts may be removed? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/> What do the people care for such miserable <sic>punctilions</sic> in the hour of a nation's agony?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>Sir, an honorable peace is within the grasp of this Congress without further bloodshed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>This Congress knows that it is so, and when the people shall realize that it is only the infamous design to strengthen the anti-slavery movement that prevents an effort to obtain that peace, woe to the chiefs of the <orgName n="Abolition party" type="party">Abolition party</orgName> in the land. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/> But, enough of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>I appeal with better hope to the loftier feelings that should pervade humanity, and especially pervade this august assemblage &mdash; that should, by the nature of its sacred functions, be far removed from the miserable ambition of reducing a section of our common country to the extreme, and therefore dangerous, condition of despair. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/> Sir, there may be a fascination in the gory magnificence of war. There may be a craving for marshal glories in the hearts of men, and an instinct of contention which we share in common with the brute creation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>But if over there can be a time when a more <name>Christian</name> impulse should possess our souls, it is now; now, when the triumph and consciousness of strength give us the noble privilege of extending the hand of reconciliation without fear of degradation, or of self-reproach for cowardice.--If adversity has been our excuse for sternness, let success be our plea for magnanimity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>For, after all, they are our brothers, sir; and some softening of the stern <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> vigor which our rulers assumed is due to that brotherhood, which, by untimely severity, may be cancelled now forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>None. The single idea has been forced upon the people that the sword, and the sword alone, must decide the issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>Sir, If to have but little faith in the efficacy of the sword for joining severed friendships, if to earnestly desire peace and to deprecate the horrors of war, be treason, then am I a traitor; and I am prouder of such treason than others have the right to be of their vindictive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>flaming and pretentious patriotism. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>They will awaken soon to the consciousness that such victories are being purchased at a sacrifice that is terrible to contemplate; that a national debt is being created which, in its rapid accumulation, is appalling &mdash; a debt which, if ever paid, will press like an incubus upon future generations, stunting the growth and paralyzing the vigor of our young Republic or, if repudiated, resting a blot upon our annals. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/> I am no advocate of bloodshed, but if a foreign war should be the alternative of submission to foreign insolence, I trust that I should be among the last to fall prostrate that the hurricane might sweep harmlessly by.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>Above all things, I hold dear that national honor which we have ever, till of late, preserved untarnished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>However gloomy may be the aspect of things at home, I would have our flag float as proudly as ever abroad, not even deigning to make domestic affliction a plea for humility, an excuse for cowardice, or a palliation of national shame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>Whenever occasion demands that a stand should be made against foreign aggression, or rebuke administered to foreign pride, or a chastisement inflicted upon foreign insolence, I would have the gauntlet thrown down upon the impulse of the national sentiment, without reference to domestic exigencies, or pausing to measure the strong proportions of the foe. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/> In the heat of our private discord, we seem to have forgotten that our great mission as a people is to republicanize the world, to advance the principle that men are capable of self- government, and to check the progress of monarchy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>Sir, we are losing ground in the fulfilment of that sacred mission, and monarchy has gained a new foothold while we have been weakening our sinews with intestine strife.--And to what purpose?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>It is possible that gentlemen can hope to reconstruct the <rs>Union</rs> by pursuing a policy of unrelenting severity!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>What! a Union of unwilling States, driven into companionship at the point of the bayonet, and held there hereafter by military power!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>Such a Union would not be worth the shedding of <num value="1">one</num> brave man's blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>We want their hearts or we want them not at all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>To slay their soldiers, lay, waste their lands, and burn their cities, must be within our power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>But to hold them in subjection, having conquered them, would, in itself, be a final repudiation of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> principle of republicanism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>Prosecute this war until you have accomplished the necessity of holding a subdued section in subjection, and the world will look in pain for a republic on the western hemisphere. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/> Sir, I love to entertain the hope that our Union will be restored upon the foundation laid down by our fathers; and I desire no changes in the plan of that glorious superstructure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>But I am not so unnatural a worshipper of the <rs>Union</rs> as to seek its salvation with the destruction of those for whose welfare it was conceived; to build it up upon the dead bodies of my countrymen, when other means are at hand for its reconstruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>I would purchase its redemption otherwise than by anarchy and ruin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>I would not fling away the substance to perpetuate the name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>If there has ever been a period in the history of Republics when prolonged civil strife has failed to curtail the liberty of the masses, I have not read that history aright.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>Already, with <num value="1">one</num> year's bitter experience, we have beheld some of the dearest privileges of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> citizenship wrested from our grasp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>And how long, at the same rate, before, upon the convenient plea of necessity, we shall be stripped of other rights which heretofore have made us deem ourselves freemen?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>How long, while personal liberty new depends on the nod of an official.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>How long, while the press, the guardian of liberty the friend of the masses, is shackled, gagged, cowed down to sullen silence, or, worse yet, become the soinion of a party?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>How long, while voters are arrested at the polls by military process, and legislators are buried off to prison before they can assume their sacred functions!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>How long, while the partisans of life immaculate <orgName n="Abolition party" type="party">Abolition party</orgName> are coining money out of the blood of their countrymen, parading their showy patriotism and shouting <q>&#x0022;Union,&#x0022;</q> with their arms up to the elbows in the public Treasury?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>How long, sir, will the people of the <rs>North</rs>, taxed beyond endurance, robbed and cheated by an over-craving horde of political bayous &mdash; how long will they have a choice between freedom and anarchy between a republic and a despotism?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>Alas! we still cling to the name of a republic, but have we the reality?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>It is entirely at the option of <num value="1">one</num> man, or of a council of men, whether the citizen shall breathe in freedom the free air of Heaven.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/> Sir, it is only a sign and forerunner of what most inevitably be, should the <rs>South</rs> be <hi rend="italics">crushed</hi> into the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>You may bring the <rs>South</rs> to terms with your bayonets, but when you have done so, you will have a bond of air; a covenant to enforce which will necessitate this Government to assume the functions of a military despotism, and to intake which at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> opportunity will be all aim and a purpose on the part of the subdued section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>What they have attempted once they will not fail to attempt hereafter, when smarting under the remembrance of defeat, when cherishing the deadly hate that a war to the utterance will engender. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/> For the sake of union now and of union hereafter &mdash; not enforced union, but the strong union of willing hearts &mdash; let the word of peace go forth; let the hand of reconciliation be extended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>Why, sir, I have heard such words of bitter hatred expressed towards these Southerners by Northern lips, that I fear it may be already too late ever to renew the bonds of fraternity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>Such sentiments I have heard of implacable resentment, of thirsting vengeance, of sectional antipathy, as <persName n="Hannibal,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Hannibal,nomatch:0"><surname>Hannibal</surname></persName> was taught to nurture against <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>; as <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>, in her quenchless jealousy, conceived towards <placeName reg="Carthage, Smith, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098271">Carthage</placeName> to the end.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>It is a sentiment fitter for the epoch of a purpled <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> than for the <rs>Christian</rs> age in which we live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>It is the sentiment of <num value="1">one</num> who rules with a rod of iron, not of a great and generous people who assume to rule themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>Enough has been done in proof of the valor of the <rs>North</rs> and the resources of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>Let something be now done for the sake of the past; for the sake of the memories of the <name>Revolution</name>, of the struggle of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>, of the battle-field of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>; for the sake of a Union whose cement shall be forgiveness for the past, and friendship and forbearance for the future. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/> In place of exulting over victories, and longing for new triumphs, how much more pleasant and more holy to draw a picture of the joy that will pervade many a now gloomy household when the glad tidings of peace shall be borne from city to village, from village to homestead, from lip to lip, and heart to heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>A nation's jubilee would well repay you for some little yielding of your stern policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>How many arms would be outstretched, how many hearts would bound to give a welcome home again&#x0022; to the war stained volunteer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>Oh, sir, those meetings at the cottage threshold, those clasping at the farm-house porch, those clearings of the throbbing bosoms of women to scarred and manly breasts, were worth all the laurels that were ever snatched from blood-stained fields.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>The news of our victories has been hailed with p&#x00E6;ans and illuminations; but with the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> tidings of peace, there is not a hovel in the land that would not have a candle at its window, not a palace that would not blaze with splendors in token of the advent of a blessing priceless beyond all earthly triumphs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/> Then, sir, let us lower the points of our victorious swords, and parley with the foe while the bugle blasts of victory are yet ringing in our ears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>If we are free in anticipation from the peril of future reverses; if we are sanguine that the <rs>Federal</rs> arms are henceforward gifted with invincibility, that is the noblest reason why we should say to our opponents, <q>&#x0022;pause, if you will; reflect.&#x0022;</q> Let us yield them <num value="1">one</num> chance for reconcilement, before we drive them to the resistance of despair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>There can be no victory where kith and kin, where brothers and fellow-countrymen, where men who are bound to each other by the holiest of past associations, are struggling for supremacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>All is defeat; all is disaster; all is misfortune, tears, and mourning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>Do not let us efface with blood every sacred memory that may yet bind these men to us as brothers.--Give <num value="1">one</num> sign of invitation before the death struggle be renewed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>Let the spirit of forgiveness pass between the lines of those opposing hosts, and with the blessings of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> those armed legions will take a lesson from <persName n="Sabinia,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Sabinia,nomatch:0"><surname>Sabinia</surname></persName> and early <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>, whose soldiers, united by domestic ties, threw down their weapons upon the battle's verge, and sprang to each other's embrace. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/> Sir, I have spoken freely, studying only to make my words an index to my thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>My opinions have brought upon me the censure, often most discourteously expressed of many who differ with me; but for that I care but little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>I am content to bide the hour that shall set me right before my countrymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>As I have believed the prosecution of this war to be a widening of the gulf that separates the sections, I have earnestly opposed it. I have always looked upon the subjugation of the <rs>South</rs> as a project whose fulfillment would strike a heavy, perhaps a fatal, blow to true republicanism, and although I will yield to no man in devotion to the <rs>Union</rs>--although I would make any and every personal sacrifice to restore its glory and integrity &mdash; I will never consent, even for the sake of that Union, to yield up my birthright as a freeman; to sacrifice those principles of self-government, those rights of free speech, free thought, and personal liberty, without which Union is but a mockery and a Marque. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/> It is not grandeur and extent of territory that I covet as the chief attributes of the <rs>Government</rs> under which I am to live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>Were I <num value="1">one</num> of but single community, insignificant in numbers, but secure in a guarantee of pure <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> ministration of affairs, I would be proud of my citizenship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>But the union of a <num value="1000">thousand</num> States, each <num value="1">one</num> as great and populous as the noble <num value="1">one</num> among whose representatives I have the honor to be, I would detest &mdash; yes sir, in my most inmost heart defeat, if the holding together of component parts should create a necessity for the assumption of despotic power. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/> Self-government is the <name n="God" type="God">god</name> of my political idolatry, and the <rs>Union</rs> is but a temple in which I have worshipped it. Should that temple be destroyed, I would not forsake the creed, nor would the mighty principle be buried in the ruins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>I love and would preserve the temple, for beneath its roof are gathered the treasures of holy past associations; up on its hallowed walls are inscribed the names of patriots, from the <rs>North</rs> and from the <rs>South</rs>; whose blood has been its cement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>But rather would I have the glorious fabric crumble to the dust, them see the spirit of despotism enshrined within its sacred precincts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/> I have seen already the silent but lengthening shadow of absolutism creeping into the spot.

It was this: Her baby, an interesting little creature, <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> old, was lying dead in the village, and the vicar declined to consign it to consecrated ground unless the customary fees were paid.--<q>&#x0022;Sure, your honor will give a trifle to get the blessed baby put decently under the ground?&#x0022;</q>--Now, we were personally acquainted with the vicar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>He was the most amiable of men. Rather than have witnessed those gushing tears for the space of <num value="1">one</num> minute, he would have gladly submitted to be buried alive along with the babe.

<head>A railway adventure.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/> Our young friend Engenius once met with a very unpleasant adventure in a railway train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>Bound for town, to enjoy a week or <num value="2">two</num> of intellectual recreation, he noticed on the platform of the station whence he started an affecting scene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>A lady in deep mourning, apparently young and handsome, bade farewell, with ill-concealed emotion, to a swarthy gentleman, clad in the height of fashion, but laboring under the disadvantage of a flattened nose and a slight cast in the eye. Who can account for tastes?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>Pity is akin to love, and probably the lady had been touched originally by the man's extremely unprepossessing appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>The railway whistle gives the fatal signal &mdash; there is no time to lose &mdash; the lady tears herself away and lightly springs into a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class carriage, of which Engenius chances to be the sole occupant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>Off went the train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>The lady waved out of the window a handkerchief moistened by her tears, and burying her face in her hands, wept silently and persistently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>What could <persName n="Eugenius,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00032" reg="mostcommon:Eugenius,nomatch:0"><surname>Eugenius</surname></persName> do. He could only offer the respectful tribute of an occasional sigh or a glance of modest sympathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>At Swindleburg, as every <num value="1">one</num> knows, the train stops <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure> for refreshments.

As the train approached <placeName reg="London, Madison, Ohio" key="tgn,2080432">London</placeName>, he endeavored to sooth her mind by other unostentatious little civilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>In accents of deep compassion he asked her commonplace questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>Would she like the window up?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>Might he offer her the loan of his railroad rug?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>The rug was accepted with silent gratitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>Presently the train rolls into the <rs>London</rs> terminus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>Our young friend leaps from the carriage in order to procure a cab for his forlorn companion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>He has barely recovered his balance when a swarthy gentleman, dressed in the height of fashion, with a flattened nose and a slight cast in the eye, seizes him by the throat and communicates his intention of instantly giving him into custody on a charge of insulting the unprotected female who had been his fellow-traveller to <placeName reg="London, Madison, Ohio" key="tgn,2080432">London</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/><persName n="Eugenius,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00035" reg="mostcommon:Eugenius,nomatch:0"><surname>Eugenius</surname></persName> remembers little more beyond a dreadful now &mdash; his hat knocked over his eyes amidst the plaudits of an indignant mob &mdash; the interference of a puzzled policeman, who believed the asseverations of neither party &mdash; and the final surrender of all of the ready money in his pocket to the swarthy man of fashion with the imperfect nose, as the shortest mode of effecting his escape from the clutches of a brace of conspirators. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>They have ploughed up his little farm, and planted him in.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/> It is not difficult to comprehend the feelings which prompt such ebullitions as those of the lamented <rs>Donnelly</rs>, in his last letter to the adorable <rs>Susan</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>It is a not uncommon boast among the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> that they not only intend to occupy the <rs>Southern</rs> farms, but that the <rs>Southern</rs> men shall do the work, and, while <q>&#x0022;the <rs>Northern Marion</rs> presides in the mansion, the <rs>Southern</rs> lady shall bend over the washing tub.&#x0022;</q> We care not to enumerate the difficulties which would embarrass the execution of this project.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>But a menace of this kind, a threat to degrade the men and women of the <rs>South</rs> to such a condition, could only proceed from natures which are in themselves inherently servile and brutal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>It develops in the most unmistakable manner the rankling envy and jealousy which have as much to do as any other cause with this atrocious war. We do not desire to involve in such a charge the whole Northern people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>We are well aware that there still exists in that section some remnant of the social worth and excellence of former days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>But the great mass of the population is simply the peasantry of the Old World transported to the shores of the new and fighting out that quarrel with their betters in this hemisphere which they had begun and carried on unsuccessfully in another.

This was the prompting motive of the antired disturbances in New York, and it lies at the foundation of the whole fierce outcry against slavery very.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>It is not the sorrows of the slave, but the comfort and dignity of his master which stir to the very bottom their philanthropies bile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>They can find no parallel in Southern society to their own condition except that of the negro and <hi rend="italics"><unclear></unclear>lachrymn.</hi> The master remind them of the fendal lords to whom their forefathers once paid homage, and whose dominion they were only able to escape by flying like fugitive slaves to <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>The idea of gentlemen and ladies in a country where they had never expected to find either, fills them with horror and rage, and hence they determine to exterminate them, or what has always been a favorite scheme of revenge by inferiors towards their superiors, of degrading them, making them exchange places with their subordinates, and be transformed into <q>&#x0022;servants of servants and slaves of the devil. &#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/> But the degradation of a people, fortunately, is an achievement beyond any power to effect but their own. A race of men may be beaten in battle; their arms may be taken away; their country subjugated; their political, civil and religious rights sacrificed, but they can never be degraded except by their own hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>Even the <rs>French Revolution</rs> &mdash; that leveling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>The demoniacal exultation of the bloodhounds, in witnessing the uncertainty of human greatness, as exhibited in the death agonies of their superiors in station, sever disturbed the composure of the dying men Even those of them whose frivolity and licentiousness <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> evoked the storm of popular fury are said to have been the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to display the most chivalric courage in the terrible face of the guillotine. --Beautiful women, too, in all the pride of their loveliness, met the inhuman stare of the mob undismayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>This noble spirit &mdash; this triumphant victory of the well born and the great &mdash; was a continual insult to the populace, who saw themselves defrauded of half their promised vengeance, and they learned that they might kill, but <hi rend="italics">they could never humiliate them.</hi> In vain they dipped their hands in their red life blood, and holding up their dripping fingers asked, <q>&#x0022;How did it differ from that of the <name>Canaille</name>!&#x0022;</q> Their hearts gave the lie to the taunt; for they witnessed instances of heroism, from gray hairs and tender womanhood, that would have shamed the proudest deeds of their new born chivalry.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/> It will prove as impossible for <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republicans</rs> in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, as for Red <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> to degrade those whom nature and <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> have made their superiors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>We are no admirers of <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> royalty or <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> aristocracy, but still less are we admirers of an ignorant mob.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>Men are neither born equal nor can they be made so by any process which philosophers or statesmen have yet discovered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>In the mean time he devolved the whole burden of the <rs>Government</rs> on Godoy, a worthless favorite, and on the <rs>Queen</rs>, between whom and Godoy it was well known that an improper intimacy existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>On the west of the village a short, shallow <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs> makes its way towards the maters of <placeName reg="Charleston Bay">Charleston Bay</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>The gun-carriages were perforated and torn by many balls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>Many of our men fell at the guns and along the line formed to the rearward of the battery on its right flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>The contest was very unequal and trying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>He began to fall back fairly beaten off. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/> While the struggle was progressing immediately on the rear right flank of the battery against these <num value="3">three</num> regiments, a formidable force of the foe attempted, by passing further out to the west, to gain the rear of our position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>But in skirting a wood they came upon the advancing lines of the <rs>Eutaw</rs> regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>Nothing was left but retreat from every portion of the field. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/> It was a bloody fight, fought against odds, by exhausted men, without preparation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>It was a signal victory of Southern patriots over the murderous invaders of their soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>The <num value="5">five</num> regiments attacking are said to be the <orgName type="regiment" key="NY79">79th N.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>But for the distance of our other troops and the brief time occupied in the action, together with obstructions in the road, preventing the passage of <orgName n="Light Artillery" type="artillery">light artillery</orgName> to the enemy's rear, their whole force may, perhaps, have been taken or cut up. From the account of prisoners, who assert that there were <num value="9">nine</num> <orgName type="mil" key="USRegiment">United States regiments</orgName> out that morning it is probable that <num value="4">four</num> regiments were held in reserve to support the <num value="5">five</num> engaged, and to protect their retreat. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>We have been brought officially in contact with mail robbers, the extent of whose operations was by no means inconsiderable, but by the side of their trans-Atlantic <hi rend="italics">confrere</hi> these gentry must hide their diminished heads, and acknowledge themselves but the merest tyros and bunglers in the are of letter stealing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/> A colossal <orgName n="Post Office" type="office">post office</orgName> robbery has been detected, which has been going on for several years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>The name of the guilty party is Kalab.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>His duty in the <rs>Vienna</rs> <orgName n="Post Office" type="office">post-office</orgName> was the assorting of out-going letters for which purpose he had <num value="2">two</num> tables at his disposition, <num value="1">one</num> of which tables was provided with a drawer, serving as a till, above which was an aperture for the admission of money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>Through this aperture he dropped such letters as he thought proper to purloin, removing them at a convenient opportunity to his home, for the double purpose of rifling them of their valuable contents and taking off the postage stamps which he resold &mdash; and the sum realized by him from this latter source alone is said to have exceeded <num value="10000">10,000</num> florins &mdash; about <measure n="5000dollars" type="currency">$5,000</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/> For a long time past complaints had been made of the non arrival of letters posted in the <rs type="place">Vienna office</rs>, but the postmaster, with genuine <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 10" reg="Osterreich,Europe">Austrian</placeName> official insolence, habitually treated the reclaiming as calumniators and revolutionists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>The detection of the culprit was brought about by the circumstance of a young man calling to request the with drawl of a letter mailed by him a few minutes previously, but which had already been appropriated by Kalab, whose suspicious conduct and embarrassment on the occasion caused an inquiry and search to be made, which resulted in the discovery of his crime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>A short time afterwards a large number of persons in different parts of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> were surprised by the receipt of letters from <placeName reg="Vienna, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2114749">Vienna</placeName>, some dated so far back as <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, bearing on the envelope a small printed notice, <q>&#x0022;Purloined and restored.&#x0022;</q> These letters were those which were found in Kalab's possession. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/> At the commencement of his operations Kalab was accustomed to burn the stolen letters in he stove, but his landlord complaining of the inconvenience caused by the smoke, he was obliged to discontinue the practice and preserve the evidence of his crime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>It is presumed that he purloined not less than <num value="100000">one hundred thousand</num> letters, of which <num value="62720">sixty-two thousand seven hundred and twenty</num> were found in his possession. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>Such of them as had been opened were rescaled and forwarded to their addresses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>Kalab had accumulated an extensive collection of photographs, abstracted from letters passing through his hands, and in his room were found a number of cigar boxes containing postage stamps of all denominations, which he had removed after wetting the inside of the envelopes, by means of certain tools ingeniously contrived so as to leave no trace of the operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>The stamps he then are fully dried pressed and gummed taking them in small quantities to the office, and re-selling them to the public disposing of about <num value="25">twenty-five</num> or <num value="30">thirty</num> florins worth per day. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/> The arrest of Kalab caused great excitement among the citizens of <placeName reg="Vienna, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2114749">Vienna</placeName>, and much indignation is expressed by those to whom his rascality has caused so much inconvenience and loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>The <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> language is fertile in epithets, and he has received the soubriquet of <hi rend="italics">brief-master,</hi> or <q>&#x0022;letter weasel.&#x0022;</q> His trial has not yet taken place. </p>
