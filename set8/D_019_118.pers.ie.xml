<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/> --Whether clear or cloudy, a rosy sky at sunset presages fine weather; a red sky in the morning bad weather, or much wind, (perhaps rain;) a grey sky in the morning, fine weather; a high dawn, wind; a low dawn, fair weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/>Soft looking or delicate clouds foretell fine weather, with moderate or light breezes; hard-edged, oily-looking clouds, wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/>A dark, gloomy, blue sky is windy; but a light, bright blue sky indicates fine weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/>Generally, the softer clouds look the less wind, but perhaps, more rain may be expected; and the harder, more greasy, rolled, tufted or ragged, the stronger the coming wind will prove.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>Also, a bright yellow sky at sunset presages wind, a pale yellow, wet; and thus, by the prevalence of red, yellow or grey tints, the coming weather may be foretold very nearly; indeed, if aided by instruments, almost exactly.--Small, inky-looking clouds foretell rain; but if alone, may indicate wind only.--High upper clouds crossing the sun, moon, stars, in a direction different from that of the lower clouds, or the wind then below, foretell a change of wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>When sea-birds fly out early, and far to seaward, moderate winds and fair weather may be expected; when they hang about the land, or over it, sometimes flying inland, expect a strong wind with stormy weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>There are other signs of a coming change in the weather, known less generally than may be desirable, and therefore worth notice; such as when birds of long flight, rooks, swallows, and others, hang about home, and fly up and down, and low &mdash; rain or wind may be expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>Also when animals seek shelter places, instead of spreading over their usual range; when pigs carry straw to their styes; when smoke from chimneys does not ascend readily (or straight upward during calm), an unfavorable change is probable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>Dew is an indication of fine weather; so is fog. Neither of these <num value="2">two</num> formations occur under an overcast sky, or when there is much wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/><num value="1">One</num> sees fog occasionally rolled away, as it were, by the wind, but seldom or never formed while it is blowing. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>More than <num value="1">one</num> attempt had been made to frighten M &mdash; without success; but <num value="1">one</num> dark, stormy evening, <num value="1">one</num> of his brother chips resolved to see if there was any scare in him, fixed himself in a lonely piece of wood through which M &mdash; had to pass on his way home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>Suddenly the ghostly figure confronted him, and, in a sepulchral voice, commanded him to stop.--M &mdash; did so, and, after regarding his companion for a moment, said, with the utmost coolness, <q>&#x0022;I can't stop friend; if you are a man, I must request you to get out of the way, and let me pass; if you are Old Nick, come along and take supper with me--<hi rend="italics">I married your sister!</hi>&#x0022;</q> </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>Let each bear the other's burden the while &mdash; let each cultivate the mutual confidence which is a gift capable of increase and improvement &mdash; and soon it will be found that kindliness will spring up on every side, displacing constitutional unsuitability, want of mutual knowledge, even as we have seen sweet violets and primroses dispelling the gloom of the grey sea rocks. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
