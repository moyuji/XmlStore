<head>Dentists.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/> A petition of Dentists has been presented to Congress, praying that this class of special practitioners; or at least such of them as have been in practice <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure>, may be exempted from service in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>Their number is said to be very small, and their services of great importance to the health and comfort of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>If only those above the conscript age are exempted the same efficiency is not to be expected of them in those delicate operations which belong to their profession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>The memorial of the dentists seems very reasonable and moderate, only asking that those over <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> practice may be exempted from military service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>The fact that their petition is approved by the <rs type="role" reg="Surgeon General">Surgeon General</rs>, and recommended by the principal medical officers of the <rs>Government</rs> and eminent practitioners of medicine, is evidence enough of the importance of the professional services of dentists to the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>If members of Congress will refer the matter to their wives and sweethearts they will not hesitate in their verdict, and, apart from this, anything that relates to the jaw has a peculiar claim on that loquacious assemblage. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/> We do not wish to damage the claims of dentists by our advocacy, and therefore suggest that drawing teeth is only a small part in the duties of their profession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>We are aware of the horrible calamities to the country, the cause of human freedom, and inhuman oratory, which would result from Congress having its teeth drawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>The dentists can plug and fill their teeth, and make artificial ones in place of the original, thereby making a new member as good as an old, which is more than the people at large always do. Nothing is more becoming and appropriate in a public man than a false mouth, and any class which furnishes a politician with this glittering and beautiful index of his character deserves his eternal gratitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>It, however, they must be sent to the army they ought to be allowed to draw and arm themselves with the molars of every member of Congress who wastes the time of the country in long speeches, and then, though few in number, each man would prove himself a Samson, and slay the <name>Philistines</name> with the same weapon. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/> In all seriousness, we advise members of Congress not to reject rashly the petition of the dentists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>If everybody is to be put in the army, the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> may not much longer have use for teeth; but as there is no probability of this, we invoke them to have compassion on a suffering people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>The time may come when they themselves may have occasion to repent the rashness of putting all dentists in the service.

<head>Rising in value.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/> If the currency has depreciated, it is some consolation to reflect that some other things, once considered of inferior value, have considerably risen in the scale of public appreciation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>The animal creation in particular has advanced to a position which commands the profound respect of the best society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>As man is, (or was,) but little lower than the angels, so beeves, hogs, and turkeys may now be regarded as but little lower than men. The only difference for example between a hog and a speculator, is that <num value="1">one</num> goes on <num value="4">four</num> legs, and the other on <num value="2">two</num>, a disparity which is more than counterbalanced in the hog's favor by the fact that death increases his value, whereas the body of the speculator is not good to eat, and his soul is so small that the <name>Devil</name> would be as loth to take it in payment of his dues as <num value="1">one</num> of <persName n="Memminger,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00171" reg="mostcommon:Memminger,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Memminger</surname></persName>'s assignats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>In view of the great appreciation of hog meat, we should say that swine might with obvious propriety be allowed the freedom of the city, and made eligible to a seat in deliberative bodies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>No small injustice has been done animals in general by designating <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00172" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName> &#x0022;the <name>Beast</name>.&#x0022; Under the existing rates of animal food, such a title is a compliment entirely undeserved, and which <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00173" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName> will rejoice to monopolize. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/> Not only have the lower orders of brutes increased in respectability, but things which were once regarded as evils have now become objects of respect and esteem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>The various &#x0022;ills that flesh is heir to&#x0022; are no longer considered ills.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>Rheumatism, which was once dreaded as a torturing fiend, has become as popular as a beautiful coquette, tormenting and yet enchanting her spell-bound victims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>There's &#x0022;a tear in the eye and a smile off the lip&#x0022; of each of its successful votaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>Gout is also much sought after, but in these hard times few families can get above rheumatism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>Gout would cost as much money as a substitute, but &#x0022;rheumatics&#x0022; can be had without the cost of a dollar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>Where fuel is so scarce and wet weather so abundant, there is no <num value="1">one</num> too poor to afford a rheumatism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>A good many other diseases, which will readily occur to the intelligent reader, have risen of late into popular favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>We think a chapter may be found in almost any work on medical jurisprudence, setting forth in detail the various maladies which are likely to prevail in time of war among citizens of a pacific turn of mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>A careful study of these will supply a rich bill of fare to men whose thoughts are turned on peace, and enable each man to select a dish to his mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>Among them all, however, we know of none superior to rheumatism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>It looms upward among ordinary anti-military diseases, like bacon and cabbage upon our <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> tables.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>Even a Confederate <rs type="role2">Surgeon</rs>, whose spirits rise at a gunshot wound, and becomes exuberant over an amputation, loses all heart and is forced to fall back when brought face to face with a good old-fashioned rheumatism. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/> Old age, once at an awful discount, has now become an object of universal respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>Men who once shuddered at the idea of becoming old, now look upon a gray beard with religious veneration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>They, who so long dreaded the down hill of life, would now cheerfully barter their vigorous prime for a gray beard, a weak back, and pipe stem legs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>No schoolboys ever slid down a snowy declivity with half the alacrity they would slide down the winter side of life, if they could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>Alas, for them!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>Every dog must have his day. These envied old fellows have spent many a bitter hour in relaxing their hold upon the joys of youth, and brooding over the ashes to which their bright expectations have turned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>They have felt the pangs of waning influence, and the contumely of being hustled from the various walks of active life by younger and more vigorous </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/> men. It must be some compensation for their miseries that old age has at last become honorable, that there are so many ingenious youths who prefer its crutches to the warrior's sword, and would rather drink gruel and sleep with its legs in flannels, than lap up human blood, or be smothered in a bed of laurels. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
