<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/> On the <dateStruct value="--5"><day reg="2">fifth</day></dateStruct> <time>day</time> of this month I directed you to call out sufficient military force, and seize all ships then in the harbor of <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> belonging to citizens of the <placeName reg="New York" key="tgn,7007568">State of New York</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>The reasons for the seizure were briefly stated in the order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>Citizens of this State had been robbed of their property by the police of New York, acting under the authority of that State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/>I had demanded the restoration of the property to its owners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>The Governor of that State had given an evasive reply, excepting to the form of the demand sent by telegraph; which clearly evinced his disposition not to comply by ordering the restoration of the property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>If the protection of this State were not in such case afforded to its citizens, it not only invited further aggressions upon their rights, but forfeited all just claim to their allegiance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/>I therefore had no alternative left but to order <hi rend="italics">reprisals.</hi>--This is the mildest remedy provided not only by the law of nations, but by the law of nature, for the redress of grievances between sovereign States, in the last resort. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/> Your prompt execution of the order, by the seizure of <num value="5">five</num> vessels owned by citizens of New York, met my highest approval.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>The seizure was made on the morning of the <num value="8" type="ordinal">eighth</num> of this month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/>On the evening of that day, I mailed to the <rs>Governor</rs> of New York, at <placeName reg="Albany, Albany, New York" key="tgn,7013266">Albany</placeName>, a communication stating the fact of the seizure, with the reasons for it; and that I should hold the ships till justice should be done the injured citizens of this State, by the restoration of the property of which they had been robbed by the police of the <placeName type="city" key="tgn,7007567">city of New York</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/> On the night of the <dateStruct value="--9"><day reg="9">ninth inst.</day></dateStruct>, I received a telegraphic dispatch from <persName n="Lamar,,G.,B.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00401" reg="default:Lamar,G.,B.,,"><foreName>G.</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Lamar</surname></persName>, of New York, whom I had appointed agent to receive the guns seized by the police, if delivered up by the authorities, stating that the guns were then at the command of their owners, and asking me to release the ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>At the same time I received a dispatch from <persName n="Boston,Mister,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00402" reg="default:Boston,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Boston</surname></persName>, the <rs>Collector</rs> of the port of <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, stating that he had just been informed by <persName n="Lamar,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00403" reg="nearbymention:Lamar,G.,B.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lamar</surname></persName>, that the guns had been delivered up. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/> Regretting the necessity which compelled me to resort to a means of redress which, while natural and legal, might interrupt the commerce between the <num value="2">two</num> States, and expose to temporary hardship individual citizens of New York, whose property, under the laws of nations, is subject to seizure for such outrages committed by the authorities of their own State, though they may disapprove and condemn them, I was determined not to occupy the position of an aggressor for a single hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>So soon, therefore, as I was informed that the authorities of New York had made reparation for the robbery, I immediately ordered the release of the vessels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>Since that time I directed <persName n="Lamar,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00404" reg="nearbymention:Lamar,G.,B.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lamar</surname></persName> to have the guns shipped to <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, that they might be delivered to their owners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>He now informs me that he demanded their shipment, and was informed by the <rs>Superintendent</rs> of the <name>Police</name> of New York <hi rend="italics">that he had changed his mind,</hi> and that he would not now permit the guns to be shipped; but that he would order further seizures of what he is pleased to call <q>&#x0022;contraband articles.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/> <measure n="12days" type="date">Twelve days</measure> have passed since I mailed to the <rs>Governor</rs> of New York the communication above referred to, and I have received no response from him. He has not only refused, therefore, to order the restoration of the property of which his police had plundered our citizens, within the limits of his own State, on a demand sent by telegraph, but he has neglected and refused to answer a written communication upon the subject, sent to him through the regular medium of the mail. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/> While I held possession of the vessels seized, my agent was informed that the guns were at the command of their owners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>Acting upon this assurance, I ordered the release of the vessels; and my agent is now informed that the officer in possession of the guns <hi rend="italics">has changed his mind,</hi> and that he will not now permit them to be returned to their owners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/>These facts show very clearly that it is the settled policy of the authorities of New York to subject our commerce to a surveillance which we cannot with honor submit to, and to seize upon our property and plunder our citizens at their pleasure. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/> Under these circumstances, I feel that I, as the <rs>Executive</rs> of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, would prove recreant to the high trust reposed in me by my fellow-citizens, were I to refuse to protect their rights against such unprovoked aggression, by all the means which the laws of nations, or the <rs>Constitution</rs> and laws of this State, have placed at my command. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/> It therefore becomes my duty again to direct you to call out such military force as may be necessary for that purpose, and to renew the <hi rend="italics">reprisals,</hi> by the seizure, as soon as practicable, of vessels in the harbor of <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, or other property in the city, or elsewhere within your reach, belonging to the <rs>State</rs> or to citizens of New York, at least equal in value to double the amount of the original seizures made by you. You will hold the property so seized subject to my order; and it will be released when the guns in question, (together with any other property of our citizens which has been, or may in the meantime be unlawfully seized by the authorities of New York,) are actually shipped from the harbor, and are beyond the reach or control of the police of the <placeName type="city" key="tgn,7007567">city of New York</placeName>, or the authorities of that State. </p> <closer> <salute>Respectfully, &#x0026;c.,</salute> <signed><persName n="Beown,,Joseph,E.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00405" reg="default:Beown,Joseph,E.,,"><foreName>Joseph</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName>  <surname>Beown</surname></persName>. <persName n="Jackson,Colonel,Henry,B.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00406" reg="default:Jackson,Henry,B.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <foreName>Henry</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, Aid-de-Camp, <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah, Ga.</placeName></signed> </closer> </div4> </div3>
