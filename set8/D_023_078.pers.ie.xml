<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/> The Southern <rs type="role2">President</rs> is a man of natural sagacity and considerable cultivation, combined with large political experience, and his official speeches are addressed to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> as well as <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>As a practiced speaker, he knows how to veil under vague and placable <unclear> </unclear>. of his position, as well as the darker side of this policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>The skill thus displayed has gained for his addresses the character of calmness, moderation, and dignity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>There is an evident attempt to preserve this character in the recent address, but strong passion cannot be altogether suppressed; and the fierce and vindictive spirit that breaks through the <rs>Presidents</rs> habitual calmness and reserve, is a significant proof of the exasperated temper, if not also of the desperate prospects of the <rs>Southern Government</rs>. &#x0022;Perfidy, &#x0022; &#x0022;madness,&#x0022; &#x0022;malignity,&#x0022; are the epithets applied to the <rs>Government</rs> and people of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>But these and like phrases, sprinkled through the address, are tame and spiritless compared with the savage policy the <rs>President</rs> inaugurates &mdash; the atrocious measures he formally recommends for the adoption of the <rs>Congress</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/> The barbarous policy inaugurated by the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> not only revolts every instinct of humanity, and mocks every sentiment of justice, but is an outrage against civilization itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>In the euphemistic phraseology of <persName n="Davis,Mister,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00069" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>'s address, the measures embodying this policy which he recommends for adoption are summed up as &#x0022;retributive justice. &#x0022; <num value="1">One</num> specimen of the way in which this usurped function of avenging power is fulfilled will be sufficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>Among other measures of a similar character, the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> has introduced a bill providing &#x0022;that Union armies incongruously composed of <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">black</rs> shall not be held entitled to the privileges of war, or to be taken prisoners, and that of such as <unclear></unclear> be captured, the negroes shall be returned to their masters or publicly sold, and their commanders to be hung or shot, as may be most convenient.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/> What this really amounts to that he stated in a few words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>In the <name>States</name> of the <rs>North</rs> there are black citizens as well as white, and both may, of course, be enrolled in the regiments raised for the defence of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>This practice has not, indeed, been hitherto adopted to pay extent, but as the necessity of fresh recruits presses it will probably become more general, and soldiers of color will be found in greater numbers in the armies of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>There is obviously nothing in the very smallest degree objectionable or unusual in this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>It is a simple proceeding, dictated by common sense and common justice &mdash; as good in principle as it is expedient in practice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>Yet this proceeding the <rs>Southern Government</rs> under a blasphemous <unclear></unclear> of what they call <unclear></unclear>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>What in plain words, of the terrible offence for which this stern and exemplary punishment is to be inflicted on. It simply consists in recognizing the civil equality of the <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">colored</rs> races.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Vice-President">Vice President</rs> of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> told the world at the outset, &#x0022;The foundation of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> were laid upon the great truth that the negro is not counting the white man, that slavery is his natural and moral condition,&#x0022; in a word, a Divine ordinance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>But as the <rs>Confederacy</rs> was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to make the brilliant truth, it might have been hoped that some toleration would been tended to those on which the fight dawned more slowly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>Added to all this was a hatred of the <rs>Southern</rs> people, their opposites in every particular, who had always held them in the utmost scorn, and had never been scrupulous in expressing what they felt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>The Union secured to them the fruits of that labor; hence their avarice taught them to value it for what it brought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>For the same reason they very naturally opposed the separation of the <rs>South</rs>, and instigated, in addition, by their hatred, they were prepared to go any lengths to gratify their <num value="2">two</num> gulling passions of avarice and revenge.
