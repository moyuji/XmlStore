<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/> Improvidence and disregard of reasonable economy on the part of the <rs>Government</rs> on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, and a spirit of ruthless speculation on the other, have made this contract, and it is a question of public justice how far it shall be carried into effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>This transaction is, in some respects, of the same character with the purchase of the <name>Austrian</name> muskets, but much more remarkable in illustrating the improvidence of gentlemen prominently connected with the public service, the corrupt system of broker-age by which the <name>Treasury</name> has been plundered, and the prostitution of public confidence to purposes of individual aggrandizement. </p>

Of the period thus covered, only the expenses of about <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> are definitely ascertained; those of the residue of the time being conjectural and estimated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>The actual expenditures of the <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> for which they are ascertained, exceeded the estimates submitted to Congress in <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, <measure n="214000000dollars" type="currency">$214,000,000</measure>. At the same ratio of excess, the real expenditures for the next <measure n="18months" type="date">eighteen months</measure> of the period estimated for, will require additional appropriations to supply deficiencies, of <num value="640000000">six hundred and forty millions</num>; and the aggregate shown by the above table will be swollen to <num value="1720">seventeen hundred and twenty</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>It would be a very moderate computation to assume that the actual expenditures for the <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>, estimated at <num value="1080">ten hundred and eighty</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num>, will be from <num value="1250">twelve hundred and fifty</num> to <num value="1500">fifteen hundred</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num> or more than <num value="600000000">six hundred millions</num> a year. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/> Thus, the expenses of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> are at the rate of <num value="60000000">sixty millions</num> of dollars a month, or <num value="2000000">two millions</num> of dollars a day. Considering that this expenditure is disbursed almost wholly within the <rs>Northern States</rs>, whose population is <num value="20000000">twenty millions</num>, the average amount of money which is thus paid the <rs>Northern</rs> people by their Government in purchase of their support to itself and its measures are nearly <measure n="50dollars" type="currency">fifty dollars</measure> to each man, woman, and child, per annum; which is the largest capitation expenditure ever yet recorded in the annals of finance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/> This enormous amount of expenditure, were it not officially disclosed, would seem incredible; and it reveals the most stupendous system of largesses disbursed to a corruptible, money-loving people, for supporting an unholy measure, which the history of mankind affords. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/> These official statements remove all doubt as to the means by which the public sentiment of the <rs>North</rs>, a large portion of which was once so strongly in favor of justice to the <rs>South</rs>, and so violently hostile to measures of coercion, has been wholly changed.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/> The fact that <num value="600000000">six hundred millions</num> of dollars per annum are expended in the prosecution of this war, coupled as it is with the sudden conversion from bitter opponents of the war into its rantipole advocates, of at least half of the <rs>Northern</rs> people, displays a corruption more stupendous and more infamous than the records of human baseness can parallel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>The original opponents at the <rs>North</rs> of the war, have not only repudiated principles which they had professed for a lifetime; they have not only formed an unholy coalition with <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> men whose creed they had always held in righteous abhorrence, but they have for filthy lucre, for <num value="30">thirty</num> or <num value="40">forty</num>-piece of silver, sold their country, and consented to carry whole-sale murder and destruction to the hearthstones of their fellow-citizens.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/> According to our latest advices from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, all apprehensions of a rupture with <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> upon the late affair of the <rs>Trent</rs> may be dismissed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>Our Cabinet, we are informed, looking to the absorbing and paramount issue &mdash; the suppression of this Southern rebellion &mdash; will yield to the present demands of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> as the conditions of her neutrality, even if these demands involve the restoration of <persName n="Mason,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00310" reg="mostcommon:Mason,nomatch:0"><surname>Mason</surname></persName> and <persName n="Slidell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00311" reg="mostcommon:Slidell,nomatch:0"><surname>Slidell</surname></persName> to the protection of the <rs>British</rs> flag, and a disavowal of and an apology for their seizure by <persName n="Wilkes,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00312" reg="mostcommon:Wilkes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Wilkes</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/> In adopting this alternative of submission to these peremptory demands, the <rs type="place">Administration runs</rs> the hazard of disappointing the popular sentiment of our loyal States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>But a little reflection will satisfy every intelligent mind of the wisdom of deferring a final settlement with <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> until we shall have made an end of this Southern rebellion.--There have been some conjectures that arbitration may be resorted to; but it is better gracefully to yield to the exigencies of the crisis, and promptly relieve <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> of her convenient pretext for a quarrel, without the intervention of any <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> party. </p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/> An explanation of this character, we presume, will be considered amply satisfactory, as an atonement to the insulted flag of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>But we are asked why these humiliating concessions upon a quibble and a pretext?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>If <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>'s purpose is war, will she not find some other pretext upon which there can be no concession?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>We answer, that by yielding to the arrogant demands of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> upon this pretext of to-day we shall have reduced her to bonds of peace from which she cannot escape except as a reckless filibuster, liable to be outlawed by every other <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> Power. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/> Meantime, with the re-establishment of our peaceable relations with <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, we shall be at liberty to bring our whole military power to bear by land and sea upon this domestic rebellion.
