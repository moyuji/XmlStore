<head>The Rupture of the blockade of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/> The blockade of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> has been broken &mdash; the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs> has given notice of the fact to the <rs>British</rs> and French Consuls &mdash; by the strict rule of international law, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> must give <measure n="60days" type="date">sixty days</measure> notice before they can re-establish it. The question is whether or not the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> will be bound by that law, seeing that they affect to regard us as rebels, and therefore not entitled to the benefits of international law, and whether or not <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName> will allow their claim of right to exclude us from such benefit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>We have no doubt that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> will make the claim, and that <persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00199" reg="mostcommon:Russell,nomatch:0"><surname>Russell</surname></persName> will submit to it. The whole conduct of the man, during this war, leads us to this conclusion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/> In the beginning, it was <unclear>tained</unclear> by the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName>, and no doubt by the <rs>English Ministry</rs>, that no nation had a right to blockade its own ports, and that if the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> insisted on blockading the <rs>Confederate</rs> ports, they must acknowledge them as no longer <unclear></unclear>. In other words, the blockade of our ports was insisted to be an acknowledgment of our separate existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>This was soon given up by <persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00200" reg="mostcommon:Russell,nomatch:0"><surname>Russell</surname></persName>, if, indeed, he ever insisted upon it in Parliament, which we believe he did, though we are not certain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>Nor was it all that he gave up. By the treaty of <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct>, it was decided that a blockade to be respected must be <hi rend="italics">efficient.</hi> When called on to explain what would be considered an efficient blockade, the <rs>Palmerston Ministry</rs> established the rule that the entrance and departure of <num value="5">five</num> ships into and from a blockaded port was evidence that the blockade was not efficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>Now, instead of <num value="5">five</num>, <num value="500">five hundred</num> vessels have entered and left the port of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> since it was declared to be blockaded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>Yet, the complaisant British Minister, for Foreign Affairs still regards the blockade of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> as effective.-- If, there are, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> restore the blockade without notice, we have no doubt that he will look with perfect <hi rend="italics">nonchalance</hi> upon the capture of any number of <name>British</name> ships that may attempt to enter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>He is quite too polite to give offence to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <persName n="Adams,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00201" reg="mostcommon:Adams,nomatch:0"><surname>Adams</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/> Besides the glory of the deed, therefore, and the opportunity which the dispersion of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> ships affords to merchant vessels to enter the port &mdash; and these considerations are of great moment &mdash; we do not see that any permanent advantage into be derived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>We have no idea that <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName> would take it in dungeon were the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> to capture any number of <name>English</name> ships without notice.
