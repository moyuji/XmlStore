<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>He advises us, in effect, to cry enough, assuring us that it will be for our own good, and being convinced that he himself will reap no small benefit from it, in the saving of limb and feature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>That condition is eternal separation from the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>They are perfectly willing to be at peace with the <rs>North</rs>, provided they will let them alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Let the <rs>North</rs> take herself off, and never come back here, where she is not wanted, where she is detested, where her presence is the signal, as it is the incentive, to everlasting war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>But they have been deceiving themselves with the illusion that there is a strong <orgName n="Union party" type="party">Union party</orgName> in the <rs>South</rs>, and that they need but encouragement to come forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>This it is that induces them to indulge the fond dream of treating us as conquered rebels, and dictating their terms in the style of conquerors. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>What they might have done in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> of the war it is hardly worth while to imagine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Finding that she could not be master and her liege lord a slave, <persName><foreName>Juliet</foreName></persName> betook herself to the independence of separation, and the book she has just published is but <num value="1">one</num> of many ebullitions of interminable spleen and rancor against her husband.--She is <num value="1">one</num> of the most strong-minded, strong bodied, bilious, and spiteful old women who infest the cold latitude, and our only wonder is that she has not long since received a commission of <rs type="role" reg="Colonel">Colonel</rs> of horse from the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs>. </p>
