<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>If the writer of the article ever saw the resolutions, he has knowingly falsified them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>If he has not seen them, but supposes them to be as he states, then, according to his own report, he betrays gross ignorance in asserting that &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">a resolution to open irregular negotiations, through commissioners, with <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> for peace </hi>&#x0022; would constitute treason, and greater criminality in presuming to arraign worthy and patriotic men for something of which he is ignorant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Why should they be subjected to this malignant criticism?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>For the sake of the argument, let it be conceded that they have proposed to send commissioners to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">to open irregular negotiations for peace.</hi>&#x0022; These commissioners might be sent with no other power than to confer and consult with the authorities there on terms of an honorable peace, with instructions to report the results of such conference to the <rs>President</rs> and to this <name>House</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Such negotiations would be &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">irregular,</hi>&#x0022; and yet they might, I think would, if ratified by the treaty-making power, secure an honorable and satisfactory peace.--Who but a madman would denounce these means and this result &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">as treachery of the most infamous character?</hi>&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/> From the supposed relationship of this journal to men in power, it may have been intended, in indulging in bitter denunciation, to have the effect of intimidating the advocates of an honorable and peaceful settlement of the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Denunciation will be met by defiance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>This movement is not in the hands of timid or time serving men.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/> The <hi rend="italics">Sentinel</hi> thinks it &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">foolish, treasonable and ruinous</hi>&#x0022; for this <persName n="House,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:House,nomatch:0"><surname>House</surname></persName> to send commissioners to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, with powers limited, as prescribed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>This is to assume that no terms could be obtained which would not be &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">ruinous,</hi>&#x0022; Is there any reason for this assumption?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>That journal professed a few days since, to abolish slavery for foreign intervention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Who is authorized to say that better terms cannot be obtained from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>Who is authorized to say that terms could not be agreed upon with them without abolition or reconstruction?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>We certainly could make it to their interest to recognize us as an independent people without involving either slavery or reconstruction; and nations usually follow their interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>The question of reconstruction, however, does not arise in the proposition to negotiate, and I shall not, therefore, discuss it. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/> Nor is it &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">foolish or treasonable,</hi>&#x0022; and I will add that it is neither impolitic nor unmanly, while we are gathering up all our military strength to meet the <milestone unit="column" n="6"/> enemy, to resort to every laudable and proper effort to give peace to a distracted and bleeding country by negotiation.

<head rend="italics">The gold Market.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>The decline in gold has been very rapid within the past <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure>. On Thursday the brokers refused to buy at <hi rend="italics"><num value="50">fifty</num>,</hi> and a number of the hoarders of specie were upon the street, anxious to sell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>Yesterday, gold was very dull at <num value="47">forty seven</num> and <num value="8">eight</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>In the afternoon, several small sums were sold at the latter price, though the market, at a later hour, had a downward tendency. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/> Several causes have combined to bring about this effect:--the strenuous measures recommended by <persName n="Trenholm,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00183" reg="mostcommon:Trenholm,G.,A.,,:9"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Trenholm</surname></persName>. <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs>, to Congress; the decided action of that body in determining, by a vote of <hi rend="italics"><num value="43">forty-three</num></hi> yeas to <hi rend="italics"><num value="31">thirty-one</num></hi> nays, to seize all the cotton and tobacco in the <rs>Confederacy</rs> on Government account; and the closing of the port of <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>The scheme of finance now determined upon, and likely to be carried into effect, may be comprehensively stated thus: The cotton and tobacco of the country, having been made the property of the <rs>Government</rs>, the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> will proceed, under authority of Congress, to borrow specie, giving cotton and tobacco as security.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>This specie will be speedily applied to the redemption of a large portion of the <rs>Confederate</rs> notes now afloat at a moderate discount.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>No more notes to be issued by the <name>Department</name>; but the incoming currency to be used for Government expenditure or cancelled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>The cotton and tobacco seized will be paid for in Confederate money at the market rates (gold being the basis), at the rate of discount fixed by the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> in the redemption of the currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>An effort will be made to reduce the volume of the currency to a certain amount, and, if possible, to prevent its increase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>This course of policy, although not formally entered upon, has, nevertheless, already been somewhat effective. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>The fall of <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName>, and the subsequent closing of the port of <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName>, though deemed disastrous in a military point of view, has necessarily diminished the value of gold by lessening the demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>The public are not aware of the vast amount of influence exercised over the gold market by the operations of the blockade-running at <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>From <hi rend="italics"><num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> to <num value="100000">one hundred thousand</num> dollars</hi> in gold were required to meet the weekly demands of the buyers, and nearly all the gold drawn from the market flowed out through that channel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> last, <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">one thousand dollars</measure> in gold were sold at <num value="62.5">sixty- two and a half</num> in Confederate money <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> for <num value="1">one</num> in specie.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/><measure n="2hours" type="date">Two hours</measure> afterward came the news of the fall of <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>Immediately gold rose to <num value="71">seventy-one</num>, and for several days continued to advance, through the combined influence of the brokers, till it reached <hi rend="italics"><num value="76">seventy-six</num>;</hi> but here it stopped, and has since had a steady downward tendency. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/> So far, then, as the monetary affairs of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> are concerned, our prospects are brighter than for many days past; and should our currency continue to improve under the wholesome treatment now advised and in contemplation, our prospects in other points of view cannot grow worse. </p> </div3>
