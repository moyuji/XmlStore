<head>A year of trials.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> has now passed through nearly a year of the greatest trials ever experienced in all the other years of her history put together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>She has been the great battle-ground of the most gigantic was that was ever waged on the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Her borders have been encircled with a belt of fire, and her coast harassed by hostile squadrons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>A vast portion of her territory has been in the enemy's hands, and the seizure of that which remains has been and is the object of the most tremendous efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The children of every household are in the battle field, and who can tell what tortures of suspense have succeeded every battle, and what pangs of agony bereavement has struck to many hearts?. It has been a year of fiery trial, but the character of our people has come out of it like pure gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The year began with clouds of doubt and apprehension, then followed a brilliant succession of victories which swept every cloud from the horizon, and then a sky darker and stormier than ever before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Alternate hopes and <num value="4">four</num>, successes and reverses, have <unclear></unclear> and men have lived in the last <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> half a century of ordinary life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>It has been a year which has windowed the wheat from the chaff, silted the good from the evil, revealed the most extraordinary virtues and the most astounding selfishness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>We were once accustomed to think that the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Revolution had exhausted the crop of patriotism, but in its best days it never displayed more of self sacrifice, generosity, and heroism among all ages and all sexes, nor, we grieve to say it, did it ever exhibit among its baser spirits a greedier and grosser crew than the ravenous and heartless speculators of the present era. It has been a year decisive of the fate of what was once the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Republic.--Whatever be the issue of great battles now imminent. --and we look to them with the most hopeful confidence,--there can never be a restoration of the links of the old Union, which were formed not of bayonets and force, but of the mutual affections of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>We rejoice that <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> has thus for passed through the fiery ordeal with no stain upon her shield, no spot upon her honor, no deed of oppression and barbarity to mar the prestige of her valor, with new devotion to the principles of liberty, and increased determination to preserve and vindicate her pride and independence. </p> </div3>

<head>Unionism in the <rs>South</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> We do not know whether the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are sincere or not in their expressions of surprise at finding so little Union sentiment in <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName> and other portions of the <rs>Southern</rs> country now occupied by their armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>With their hands dripping with the blood of the sons, husbands, and brothers of the <rs>South</rs>, they profess to have anticipated a cordial and fraternal hug from the <rs>Southern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>It is possible they may have been deceived as to the existence of a strong <orgName n="Union party" type="party">Union party</orgName> in the <rs>South</rs>, but we are inclined to doubt it. They would like to subjugate us through the action of a party within our own borders, and thus escape the inconsistency and odium of forcing a foreign despotism upon our people; but if this cannot be effected, they will face the music, and quarter armies in the invaded States, supporting them at the expense of the subjugated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>There is no earthly hope of deliverance from the despotism which they call &#x0022;Union&#x0022; but the most determined and eternal resistance. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> I have received and read your speech with the deepest interest and attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>It traces the present crisis to its source, and points out the means of avoiding its consequences with perfect clearness, without declaration and without passion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>It appeals to our reason and asks only justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>It will not perhaps be so much praised as some others; but hereafter when its predictions will be fulfilled, as I presume they will be are long, unless the spirit of fanaticism is effectually checked in its career you will be quoted as <num value="1">one</num> who foretold the danger and pointed out the only means by which it could be avoided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>It gives the pleasure to see that you take the some ground, with <num value="1">one</num> exception, which I as made in a pamphlet I had prepared on the same subject, but for which I could find no publisher, I was also desirous of publishing a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> caution of a work of mine on slavery, now out of print, but was met by the same obstacle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The military as well as the political press is enthralled in the <rs>North</rs>, and <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">audi alterem partem</hi></foreign> becomes an obsolete maxim. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> If you will permit me, I will suggest to you a doubt of the policy as well as efficacy of the guarantees you propose for the future safety of the <rs>South</rs>, which will berqually denture with the <rs>Constitution</rs> as <unclear></unclear> of the late of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and the <unclear></unclear> of nature by the fanatics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/> There is, perhaps, on parallel in history to the <unclear>city</unclear> with which the <rs>Southern</rs> mind has rebounded from the downward pressure of the late calamities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>Every man acts as though all depended upon his own individual exertions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>Every man is prepared to lend his best endeavors towards, repairing our losses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>Every man is willing to risk his all &mdash; his fortune, his life, his sacred honor &mdash; in a cause which has become the dearer to him for the disasters which it has encountered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>The whole country is united as <num value="1">one</num> man, and it is animated by a spirit which possibly might not have been brought out with such intensity had we been always fortunate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>They are resolved never to submit to the invader; they will conquer their independence, or they will die in the attempt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/> We need not say that a people thus determined will never be subjugated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>The man that always rises superior to misfortune &mdash; us the giant <unclear> s</unclear> gathered fresh strength from every fresh contact with his mother ear &mdash; is superior to late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>And so it is with a nation, which, after all, it but an assemblage of men. And such is precisely the case with the people of the <rs>South</rs> at this moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>They have risen from their late disasters, reinvigorated by the fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>So far from being abashed or discouraged, they learn to recover their ancient <hi rend="italics">prestige.</hi> We hear not a murmur of fear, and we observe not a token of despondence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>All are firm, resolute, and defiant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>They are prepared to go to the extremest limit that their Government will allow them, and it is a matter of vast concern that the <rs>Government</rs> should not be outstripped by the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>In revolutionary times the <rs>Government</rs> must lead the way. It must anticipate the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>It must take care not to repress their ardor, but stimulate enthusiasm in all possible ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>Thus, and thus only, can it hope to guide and direct the storm of the revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>We have every hope that our Government, prodigious as were the mistakes it made in this direction last year, in determined to pursue a different policy now, and will prove itself equal to the trying emergency that the day has brought forth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>At any rate, it may be assured that it can never recover the ground which has been lost by lagging in the rear-of public opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>They must go along with; or go before, the revolution, if they wish to control and direct it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/> Public opinion has decided that we must, reinforce our armies powerfully for the contest in which we are involved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>This we believe is in process of fulfillment as rapidly as can be expected, or perhaps desired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>At least, we know it is so in this State, and we venture to hope that we are not much in advance of our neighbors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>Public opinion dictates a powerful addition to our navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>This we hope is also in a fair way to be accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>We have been it statedly &mdash; we know not how truly &mdash; that the officer of the <rs>Government</rs> whose duty it is to superintend that branch of the service said, last summer, that we had no need of a navy because we had no commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>Recent events have shown that the protection of commerce is not the only use to which a navy can be applied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>The enemy has done us more injury with his navy than with anything else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>And it seems strange to us that his capacity for mischief in this particular should have been overlooked, when our country is intersected by so many navigable rivers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/><placeName reg="Land batteries">Land batteries</placeName> seem to be no longer capable of stopping the advance of gunboats and steam batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>The Virginia and Monitor have rendered fortifications on the bay, river, or seashore, utterly worthless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>The heaviest guns can scarcely make an indentation in their armor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/> We must take care that the magnificent success of <persName n="Buchanan,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00058" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> do not prove a snare to us, as the victory of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> was. We slept after that, victory and gave the enemy's time to organize and discipline <num value="1">one</num> of the largest armies known to modern history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>We proved to them that we were a fighting people, which previously they did not believe, and they profited by the knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>We have let them see what the <rs>Virginia</rs> can do, and already, we have no doubt they are imitating, her. Let us not, for <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> make, if it be possible, be left behind, but let us build as many steam batteries as we can, and the faster the better. </p> </div3>

<head>The conscription &mdash; again.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/> There is <num value="1">one</num> excellent feature in the conscription proposed by <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00059" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Dudley,,,:1"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/> It will have another excellent effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>All the <name>States</name> will be made to contribute equally to the war, and no <num value="1">one</num> State will be called upon to bear an undue share of the burden. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/> With regard to the constitutionality of the law. <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00060" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Dudley,,,:1"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, who knows as much about the <rs>Constitution</rs> as any other man, appears to regard it as entirely constitutional.--He recommends this plan as the best for &#x0022;exercising the power of raising armies, which is vested in Congress by the <rs>Constitution</rs>.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/> But even if it were necessary to go beyond the <rs>Constitution</rs> in this case, did not <persName n="Jefferson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00061" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jefferson</surname></persName> tell us that the power to purchase <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> was not to be found in the <rs>Constitution</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>Is not the safety of the <rs>State</rs> superior to all laws and all Constitutions?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>Is it not expressly defined by jurists as the <rs>Supreme Law</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>And did any emergency ever arise in which the safety of any State was more directly involved? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/> Gentlemen appear to fear that this power, thus exercised, may lead to a despotism among us. We have no such fears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>Apart from the belief that no person connected either with the <rs>Government</rs> or the army entertains any such design., we are confident that no people ever had a Government of that description fastened upon them, until they had become utterly demoralized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>We are confident that the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> have not reached that pitch of corruption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>When they shall have done so, they will be sure to find a master, without the aid of a conscription. &#x0022;If I had been in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, said <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00062" reg="nearbymention:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, &#x0022; I would have been a Washington.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/> It is notices, however, to go beyond our present condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>The conscription is a <hi rend="italics">necessity.</hi> It is the surest way to save the <rs>Constitution</rs>, State-Rights, and the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>It was essential that, in defiance of usage and common sense, he should set a side all evidence against the validity of a blockade derived from the escape of &#x0022;various ships;&#x0022; for he had documents in his hands which showed that hundreds of vessels have over and over again broken the blockade with perfect impunity; and it any number of such escapes would prove its in validity, the <rs>Northern</rs> case was hopeless.--<num value="1">One</num> would think that it were a stretch of courtesy to recognize a blockade where the number, of escapes, was equal to that of capture, that where <num value="2">two</num> vessels escaped for <num value="1">one</num> seized, no power whatever would venture to claim efficiency for the operation of its squadron; but when, as we believe to be near the case, the captures are not to the evasions in to high a uratic as that of <num value="1">one</num> to <num value="4">four</num>, to tell us that the blockade is effective is little is a than ridiculous and to talk of &#x0022;various ships&#x0022; having broken it, is somewhat more than disingenuous.
