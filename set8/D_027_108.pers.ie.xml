<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> as requested by your Department, we conferred with the <rs>Commissioners</rs> of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, and had the good fortune to adjust prices upon a basis calculated to harmonize the leading interests of both States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The just and enlightened views entertained by the <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> Commissioners were practically illustrated by the liberal spirit and wise terms upon which they agreed to co- operate with us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> in this revolutionary crisis, we should all agree to aid each other and the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>To rescue the country and save the people from the dangers that environ both, is clearly the duty of all. Our honor, rights and independence are at stake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Let us bind all our energies to defend and secure them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>To attain this invaluable end, the people must be fed and clothed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Our producers, manufacturers and tradesmen certainly can afford to work for moderato compensation while our gallant soldiers dare to confront our savage adversaries in their defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Certainly, if our brave men throw their protecting arms around our family altars, and gallantly defend their country for a sum too insignificant to mention, those who remain at home, enjoying the benefit of their valor, can afford to clothe and feed them and their families on the most moderate terms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> the question should be, how <hi rend="italics">little</hi> will you ask or take for your productions?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Fidelity to all the best interests of our country points to the observance of this maxim as the best test of both our charity and patriotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Let the watchword be, &#x0022;Everything for our country, and away with money-making.&#x0022; in this final and desperate struggle for liberty, beware lest, in hoarding up money and neglecting the cause of the people, you exchange your birthright for a mess of pottage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Believing that our cause appeals to all parties and interests alike, we trust the people will unite and act in concert in achieving our independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>What we <hi rend="italics">will</hi> to do, we can accomplish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>United, we are invincible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> the following prices are to be the maximum rates to be paid for the articles impressed in all cities and usual places of sale; and when impressed on the farms or elsewhere, the same prices are to be paid. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> under existing circumstances, we have deemed it not only just, but most likely to favor increased production, that producers, in future, should not be required to transport their surplus productions when impressed, but that the agents of the <rs>Government</rs> should employ or impress the neighborhood or county wagons and teams to haul all such articles, and so divide the work between the owners of wagons and teams as to be least prejudicial to those successfully engaged in agriculture: </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> in assessing the value of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class artillery and wagon horses and mules at <measure n="800dollars" type="currency">eight hundred dollars</measure>, we designed that the term should be accepted and acted upon according to its obvious common scenes import.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>In other words, that they should be selected and then impressed accordingly as their working qualities and adaptation to Army service, together with their intrinsic value, would warrant a judicious purchaser in considering them as coming within the contemplation of the <rs>Commissioners</rs> when they assessed the average value of such horses as the <rs>Government</rs> needed at <measure n="800dollars" type="currency">eight hundred dollars</measure>. But cases might arise, however, when the public exigencies would be so urgent as to demand that all horses at hand should be impressed. --yet, under ordinary circumstances, when family or extra blooded horses, or brood mares of <hi rend="italics">admitted high value,</hi> are impressed, we respectfully suggest to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> to have instructions forwarded to the impressing officers to propose and allow the owners to <hi rend="italics">substitute</hi> in their stead such strong, sound and serviceable horses or mules as shall be considered and valued by competent and disinterested parties as <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class artillery horses or <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class wagon mules. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> the term average value per head is in contradistinction to a fixed and uniform <persName n="Price,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Price,nomatch:0"><surname>Price</surname></persName> for each horse or mule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>We supposed that, in impressing a number of horses, or mules, whether owned by several persons or <num value="1">one</num> individual, some might be estimated at <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">$600</measure>, and others at different advanced rates, according to their worth, up as high as <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">$1,000</measure>--thus making an <hi rend="italics">average</hi> value or <persName n="Price,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Price,nomatch:0"><surname>Price</surname></persName> for a <hi rend="italics">number</hi> of good, sound and efficient horses or mules, <measure n="800dollars" type="currency">$800</measure> each. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> in illustration of our views, we will add that a horse with only <num value="1">one</num> eye sound might, in all other respects, be classed as a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class artillery horse, yet the loss of <num value="1">one</num> eye would justly and considerably curtail his value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>So a horse from <num value="10">ten</num> to <measure n="18years" type="date">eighteen years</measure> of age might be deemed in all other particulars as a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class artillery horse, but, of course, however efficient and able to render good service for a year or <num value="2">two</num>, yet his advanced age would justly and materially impair his value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Any horse, however he may approximate the standard of a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>- class artillery horse, must, according to deficiencies, fall below the maximum <rs>Price</rs>; and as few, comparatively, come up to the standard, and are therefore entitled to the maximum <rs>Price</rs>, so, of course, in all other instances the <rs>Price</rs> should be proportionately reduced as imperfections place them below the standard of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class, &#x0026;c. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> quality of Sorghum Molasses is the consistency of honey and free from all acidity to the taste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>But <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> and interior qualities of Molasses should be <hi rend="italics">reduced </hi> in <persName n="Price,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:Price,nomatch:0"><surname>Price</surname></persName> from <num value="10">ten</num> to <num value="0.2">twenty per cent.</num>, accordingly as they fall <hi rend="italics">below </hi> the standard of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> quality. </p>

<div4 type="entry" n="1">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> Since the adoption of our last Schedule, for the months of <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><month>March</month></dateStruct>, the financial bills passed by Congress taxing the currency have seriously impaired the value of the old issues of <orgName n="Confederate Treasury notes" type="org">Confederate Treasury notes</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>At this juncture, large numbers of horses and mules were impressed and paid for in a currency which was, in a few days thereafter, to be taxed <num value="33">thirty- three</num> and <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> per cent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> The <orgName n="State Board" type="board">Board of State</orgName> Commissioners having adjourned, and <num value="1">one</num> of its members being out of the <rs>State</rs>, it could not be convened in time to review our schedule of prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Under this state of facts, we have re-examined and re-arranged our tariff of prices so far as we have been advised of recent impressments, proposing, in this mode, to remedy any diminution of valuation which may have resulted from the action of Congress upon the currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Therefore we assess the <hi rend="italics">average</hi> value of artillery or wagon horses or mules impressed since the passage of the currency bill, of the <date value="02-17">17th of February last,</date> at <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">six hundred dollars</measure>. This award will entitle each person to receive higher compensation accordingly as each horse or mule, recently impressed may be considered as being a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, or <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>- class artillery or wagon horse or mule, whether the parties appeal to our Board or not; and the impressing officers and agents should forthwith </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> call on all those persons of whom they impressed horses or mules and propose a settlement upon the foregoing basis; but allowing to each person only such prices as <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> and <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>- class artillery or wagon horses or mules may have been estimated at by the local or county appraisers, assuming our <hi rend="italics">average</hi> appraisement of <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">six hundred dollars</measure> as a fair medium valuation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>This, then, would allow a maximum price of <measure n="800dollars" type="currency">eight hundred dollars</measure>, and a minimum price of <measure n="400dollars" type="currency">four hundred dollars</measure>, making <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">six hundred dollars</measure> the average price &mdash; thus allowing more for <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class horses or mules and proportionately less for the inferior as they may fall below the grade of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The county appraisement will be the guide in making these settlements, but within the limits of our maximum price of <measure n="800dollars" type="currency">eight hundred dollars</measure> and our minimum price of <measure n="400dollars" type="currency">four hundred dollars</measure>. This plan would perhaps be most satisfactory to the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>For whatever price the county appraisers agreed upon should be deemed fair within the range of our minimum price of <measure n="400dollars" type="currency">four hundred dollars</measure> and our maximum price of <measure n="800dollars" type="currency">eight hundred dollars</measure>; payment of whatever amount awarded to be made in the new issue of Treasury notes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> The impressing officers in those instances where there were no arbitrators or local appraisements for horses or mules impressed, should, in all such cases, themselves re-estimate the value of horses or mules thus impressed, and allow in each case such additional compensation as would, within the limits of our schedule rates, appear just and proper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>But if, after this revaluation and settlement, any person should not be satisfied, the party could then appeal to our Board and have the case reconsidered. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The quiet of the lines below <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> was yesterday only broken by the thunder of our guns at <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> gap and the occasional roar of heavy guns far away towards <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>These sounds were, owing to a heavy atmosphere, also distinctly heard in the city; and in the course of the morning a report was put in circulation that the enemy had captured the <placeName reg="Howlett House">Howlett House</placeName> battery, which is on the south side of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>, some <num value="2.5">two and a half</num> or <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> south of <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> gap.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/> This work, while in progress, and all concerning it, cannot fail to be of interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>From persons well acquainted with the geography of <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> gap, through which the canal is being cut, we have learned some facts which will enable the reader to understand the character and magnitude of the work <rs>Butler</rs> has undertaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>The isthmus known as <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> gap, which connects &#x0022;<persName n="Farrar,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00039" reg="mostcommon:Farrar,nomatch:0"><surname>Farrar</surname></persName>'s island&#x0022; with the main land or north bank of the river, is exactly <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> across, being <measure n="80feet" type="distance">eighty feet</measure> high on the western side, and sloping down to the river on the east.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>The channel of the river runs against the west side, striking it obliquely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Just off the shore at this point the water is from <num value="12">twelve</num> to <measure n="15feet" type="distance">fifteen feet</measure> deep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>The channel being on this side will greatly aid <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00040" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName> should he ever complete his canal, as had it been on the middle or on the opposite side of the river he would have been obliged to construct a huge breakwater to turn the stream into the canal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>We learn he is cutting diagonally through the isthmus, beginning a <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> below its narrowest point, and designing to come out at the point where the channel strikes the bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>This will give his canal, if ever finished, a length of about <measure n="300yards" type="distance">three hundred yards</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/> As we stated on a previous occasion, we have reason to believe that the canal proper has been begun, the cut to the water's edge, which is a necessary preliminary, having not yet been more than <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> completed. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>We are happy to be able to give the correct history of this affair, after which the reason why the guns were not brought off by the negroes will not be <hi rend="italics">unknown.</hi> The negro division, on striking the <measure n="9Mile" type="distance">Nine-Mile</measure> road at <persName n="White,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00044" reg="mostcommon:White,nomatch:0"><surname>White</surname></persName>'s old tavern, <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure> below the city, marched up in this direction, and finding our outer works wholly unoccupied, marched into them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Possibly at this moment they may have received <persName n="Weitzel,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00046" reg="mostcommon:Weitzel,nomatch:0"><surname>Weitzel</surname></persName>'s order to retreat; but if they did, it was wholly superfluous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>They were already doing the most rapid retreating that they, or any other negroes, are capable of. This is why they did not bring off any guns, and this is the whole story of the fight on the <measure n="9Mile" type="distance">Nine-Mile</measure> road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>It is proper to add, for the benefit of the reader unacquainted with the country, that the <rs>Williamsburg</rs> and <measure n="9Mile" type="distance">Nine-Mile</measure> roads meet at <placeName reg="Seven Pines, Marion, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119933">Seven Pines</placeName>, the former leaving the city through <placeName key="tgn,2625188" n="1.000 10" reg="Rocketts, Henrico, Virginia">Rocketts</placeName> and over <placeName reg="Fulton's Hill">Fulton's Hill</placeName>, and the latter over <placeName key="possibilities=53" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Union Hill</placeName>.
