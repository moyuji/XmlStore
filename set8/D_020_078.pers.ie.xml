<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> --The South requires, at the lowest estimate, <num value="6000000">six millions</num> bushels of salt a year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>With <placeName key="tgn,1125392" n="1.000 13" reg="kanawha, west virginia, united states">Kanawha</placeName> in the hands of the enemy, we know no other sources of supply on which we can depend for more than a <num value="1000000.5">million and a half</num>, or, at the utmost, <num value="2000000">two millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>It becomes a question of vital importance, whence are we to procure the other <num value="4000000">four millions</num>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>We observe that this subject is engaging the serious attention of the <name>Legislatures</name> and municipalities of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The improved plan for sea salt manufacture of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Thomassy,Professor,Raymond,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="default:Thomassy,Raymond,,,"><roleName n="Professor">Prof.</roleName> <foreName>Raymond</foreName> <surname>Thomassy</surname></persName></hi> is attracting much attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The <orgName n="City Council" type="council">City Council of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName></orgName> is the last of the public bodies which has acted upon it. What is done should be done for the public, and not permitted to fall into the hands of a corporation, to be made a source of individual interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>This Government ought not to allow <q>&#x0022;joint stock companies&#x0022;</q> to monopolize <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Thomassy,Professor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Thomassy,Raymond,,,"><roleName n="Professor">Prof.</roleName> <surname>Thomassy</surname></persName>,</hi> as we fear will be the case, unless his services are employed in a way which will secure the public interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>It is true that, individually, <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Thomassy,Professor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Thomassy,Raymond,,,"><roleName n="Professor">Prof.</roleName> <surname>Thomassy</surname></persName></hi> may enrich himself by becoming the property of stockholders, but he is <num value="1">one</num> of those true men of science and generous patriots who prefer honor and principle to sordid pelf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>There ought no more to be a monopoly of salt than of powder; but it is easy to see that there will be, if the great acquirements and experience of this gentleman in the process of salt manufacture are permitted to fall into private hands. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> The supply of salt is becoming a question of great, overshadowing, we might almost say, vital importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The producing price of the sea salt made by atmospheric evaporation in the south of <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, <placeName reg="Espana" key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Italia" key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> is not more than <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3cents" type="currency">three cents</measure> a bushel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Consul at <placeName reg="Cadiz, Harrison, Ohio" key="tgn,2078690">Cadiz</placeName> declares the average wholesale price of <placeName reg="Cadiz, Harrison, Ohio" key="tgn,2078690">Cadiz</placeName> salt to be <measure n="3.5cents" type="currency">three and a half cents</measure> per bushel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The manufacture of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> salt by the same atmospheric evaporation has been always so misunderstood that about <num value="3">three</num> <num value=".25">fourths</num> of the evaporating power is lost in the actual process of making salt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>By controlling the evaporating power salt can be made in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> as cheap and good as it is made in the south of <placeName reg="Espana" key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName> or <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>There is a good deal of difference between the price of an article thus produced and the price of <measure n="1.50dollars" type="currency">$1.50</measure> a bushel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The article which can be thus cheaply manufactured is a sea salt, like the <rs type="place">Turk's Island</rs> salt, the use of which is made obligatory by law for curing the army and navy provisions The benefit of this process ought to be secured to the public, and not be permitted to endure to the benefit of private stockholders. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>We have been <num value="1">one</num> of those who thought the <rs>State</rs> authorities at <placeName reg="Raleigh, Wake, North Carolina" key="tgn,7013949">Raleigh</placeName> were very much to blame for the unprepared condition of the coast, but the message and report, we are bound to say, do not justify such a belier; for, according to those documents, the <rs>Governor</rs> and <rs type="role" reg="Military-Secretary">Military Secretary</rs> did all they could do towards preparing the coast for defensive operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>If they are to blame for anything, it is for not making known to the people of the <rs>State</rs> that their requisitions on the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> were not acceded to. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> We learn that <persName n="Clark,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Clark,C.,D.,,:1"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Clark</surname></persName> is now doing all he can to defend the coast, and is sending forward companies and regiments as fast as they can be equipped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>He made a request recently of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, that a few well drilled regiments be sent to our coast, promising to send forward into <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> an equal number of new regiments of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>But the request has not been complied with by the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>We suppose <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> is expected to defend her coast herself, and therefore vigorous exertions should be made for that purpose without delay, which we are assured is being done, and that liberal citizens of the <rs>East</rs> are aiding the authorities all they can by private funds and force. </p> </q><bibl n=""></bibl></cit> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> --The publication of a newspaper, it must be admitted, is at all times attended with great labor and responsibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>It is true, in the piping times of peace, when everything flows along smoothly, the editor may be excused for indulging somewhat his fancy and imagination &mdash; something rich and racy, with a dash of romance, is perhaps expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>A sensation article now and then is quite the thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Even a little scandal, with more gossip and tattle, may be excused and passed off as something smart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>If the editor, under such circumstances, happens to commit a blunder, why, <q>&#x0022;nobody's hurt&#x0022;</q> but himself, and he simply pays the penalty by being laughed at for his folly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>At any rate, the penalty is seldom more than a cracked head and bloody nose, and never worse than coffee and pistols for <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>This may not be very pleasant, but it happens so frequently that editors soon get used to it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> But be this as it may, under no circumstance can the publication of a newspaper be said to be a <q>&#x0022;labor of love.&#x0022;</q> Of all occupations, it requires the most vigilant attention and the exercise of the soundest discretion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>If it be true, then, that this constant vigilance, tact, and self-reliance is required of an editor in times of peace and tranquility, how much greater must be the labor and responsibility attending the publication of a paper in these stirring times of war and excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>You may rely upon it, that the labor of editing in the present posture of affairs is attended with unusual and extraordinary embarrassments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The difficulty consists not so much in knowing what to publish as what not to publish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Even the truth is not at all times to be told.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>Considering that the <rs>North</rs> is the aggressor in this contest, that its measures against the <rs>South</rs> are of its own origination, and may be terminated at its own option; considering that nobody's interests at the <rs>North</rs> are threatened from the <rs>South</rs>, that there is no conspiracy whatever against the <rs>Northern Government</rs>, and no assault threatened upon Northern society, these arbitrary measures against the liberty of the press, of opinion and discussion, and of the person seem wholly uncalled for and gratuitous.--There might be some excuse for the inauguration of a dictatorship at the <rs>South</rs>, where servile insurrection is plotted, where the land is invaded, where the authorities are impeached as rebels, and where not only Government is assailed but society itself attempted to be undermined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>Yet it is at the <rs>North</rs> that a cowardly and atrocious petty tyranny and terrorism are practiced, while these things are wholly unknown and unthought of at the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>The contrast thus presented is the most remarkable in all its circumstances that can be found in the history of human affairs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/> We need not spend any words in accounting for the absence of a dictatorship at the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>Our people would not submit to it, except under an overwhelming sense of public danger; and they are strangers, notwithstanding the threats and formidable demonstrations of the <rs>North</rs>, to any sense of such danger from that quarter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/> But the practice of these tyrannical measures at the <rs>North</rs>, and the fame submission of that people to them are subjects of universal surprise, and puzzled conjecture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>It is reasonable to suppose that the <rs>Northern</rs> people have not become indifferent to civil liberty, and would not allow it to be overthrown, except from some great controlling public conviction of the necessity of submission to the alternative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>There can be but <num value="1">one</num> explanation; and that is a common sense that public ruin must be the result of the success of secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>The Northern people are thoroughly imbued with the conviction, that the loss of the <rs>South</rs> to the <rs>Union</rs> will destroy their prosperity, reduce them to poverty, overturn Government, and dissolve society itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>Their conviction is well founded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>Losing the <rs>South</rs>, what is there to hold the <rs>Northwest</rs> in longer union with the <rs>Eastern</rs> and Middle States?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>The geographical shape of their territory is itself sufficient to insure its separation; to say nothing of the stronger interests which would attract the <rs>Northwest</rs> to the <rs>South</rs>, and the certain loss of the <rs>Pacific</rs> slope to the <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> Confederacy of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> and New York, with which it can have no congeniality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>There is, moreover, as little sympathy between <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> and the <rs>Middle States</rs> as between New York and <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, or as between <placeName reg="Hartford, Hartford, Connecticut" key="tgn,7013695">Hartford</placeName> and <placeName reg="San Francisco, San Francisco, California" key="tgn,7014456">San Francisco</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>The separation of the <rs>South</rs> will be the signal for the thorough disintegration of what will remain of the <rs>Union</rs>; for the part remaining will be the least homogeneous aggregation of communities on the face of the globe. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/> The <rs>North</rs> still cling to the delusion that the <rs>South</rs> will ultimately come back and assent to reconstruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>In that delusion they are bent upon crushing out the sentiment at the <rs>South</rs> hostile to such an arrangement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>They will not believe or realize the fact that public opinion here on that subject is long ago concluded and irrevocable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>They are fighting us with that delusion, and with the settled conviction that secession must overthrow their political system at home, and prostrate forever the wealth and prosperity of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>We have exposed the certainty of their financial and industrial ruin, from secession, on too many occasions for it to be necessary to point out again the grounds of their own fixed conviction of that fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>It is upon this conviction that they are acting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>They themselves are telling us that this conviction is the motive upon which they are prosecuting the war with so much determination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>It will be a strange sight, it intimates, for the world when the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, which heretofore have boasted of their low taxes, and cheap Government, shall be found, after an existence of only <measure n="80years" type="date">eighty years</measure>, establishing a system as complicated and as all embracing as that of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> itself, after an existence of <measure n="8centuries" type="date">eight centuries</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>He tells the <rs>English</rs> moneyed public that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government expects and prefers to get its loan taken by its own people, and the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> admits that it has been thus far successful, alluding to the late operation of the New York, <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> and <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> banks. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/> The <hi rend="italics">Times,</hi> in admitting the wealth of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation, and its ability to pay provided it be willing, admits too much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>If the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation had the ability to pay, it would not, and if it had the will, it could not. A contemporary justly remarks that they are the poorest race upon the face of the earth.--What have they to tax?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>Take it away from them, as it will be taken away, and their houses go to decay for want of tenants, their ships not at the wharves for want of cargoes, and their manufactories lie idle for want of a market.--Their whole property &mdash; everything that they have of a taxable nature &mdash; railroad stocks bank stocks, <rs n="real estate" type="product">real estate</rs>, everything tumbles in an instant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>Their banks lately made an exhibit of specie to the amount of nearly <num value="40000000">forty millions</num>, while their liabilities seemed very fair; but the greater part of this specie was on deposit, and, within a few months, <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> of it has been removed by the depositors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>Now, the purpose of a blockade is to present all commercial intercourse with the later dieted port.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>It is not to be considered as a matter of surprise, therefore, if much instituted rule is not to be found on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>I was started from my revery by the sudden movement of my patient and the glad cry that rung from his lips, <q>&#x0022;<hi rend="italics">She has come.</hi>&#x0022;</q> The door swung noiselessly back on its hinges; a tall, magnificently formed woman, whose black garments swayed lightly to and fro, and over whose shoulders hung a wealth of raven hair, stood within the open portals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>The large, passionate eyes roam from bed to bed; then she glided forward, nearer and nearer, until it seemed to me an unseen shadow clung around her. I looked upon my patient, his arms were extended, a smile lighted up his whole face; the woman knelt by the low bed, her arms wound around that dying man, and her lips pressed passionately to his. A glory not of earth fell over the white face; the limbs relaxed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>I bent eagerly forward, suppressing the cry that rose to my lips.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>In the dim, faint light my patient was alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>I gazed eagerly around.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>Surely, I did not dream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>I brought the light to bear upon my patient's features.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>He was dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>Throwing the sheets over the stilled form, I hastened to the watchers department.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>They bore him quietly into another chamber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>His hands were clasped tightly over his chest; within them lay a closed case containing <num value="2">two</num> miniatures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/>I unfastened it. The <num value="1">one</num> side contained a picture of the unknown dead; the other, and there burst upon my view the mirrored self of that beautiful woman &mdash; this Madelene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>It was handed me to retain until called for. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/> There were no mourners; but I gathered white roses and flung them over the new grave, and went back to life's duties a sadder, and, I trust, a better woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/><q>&#x0022;It is singular.&#x0022;</q> said the attending surgeon to me, as I stood <num value="1">one</num> day glancing over the sick list, <q>&#x0022;that the wife of the gentleman you nursed that night should have died at the same hour, only <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure> before him. I am told she was suddenly indisposed as she rose from the supportable, and about <num value="12">twelve</num>, scarcely with a struggle, she died, calling passionately upon her husband.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/> He passed on to attend to his duties, not noticing the deathly pallor that gathered over my face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>I went home with a terrible fear racking my whole system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>Drawing the sacred relic from its hiding place, I wept as if some part of my life had been drawn into a vast void &mdash; wept as if the fate of these <num value="2">two</num> were blended with my own. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/> Never without a shudder do I recall that <num value="1">one</num> night in a hospital. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
