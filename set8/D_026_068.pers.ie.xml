<head>Prudence of the press.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/> The prudence and discretion of the <rs>Confederate</rs> press in general during the present war has been something remarkable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>It is true, at the beginning of the contest, when all of us were unused to war, there may have been occasional unguarded statements which were calculated to lead to unfortunate results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>But as soon as the conductors of the public journals became accustomed to the new situation their reticence was remarkable, and in distinguished contrast to the perpetual babbling of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> journals, which, down to the present hour, indulge an irresistible propensity to let the world know what their <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> intend to do. But it is almost as important to the interests of a country that its journals should be cautions in their comments upon the past as their speculations of the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>A notable illustration of this has been furnished of late by the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>That would-be Thunderer of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> press for once managed to hold its tongue while <persName n="Kilpatrick,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00172" reg="mostcommon:Kilpatrick,nomatch:0"><surname>Kilpatrick</surname></persName>'s murdering expedition was in preparation; but when the raid had got fairly started the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> could no longer contain itself, but, complimenting its marvellous secretiveness in forbearing to tell all it knew while such disclosures would be injurious, announced that it could now, without danger, reveal the fact that the object of the expedition was the capture and sack of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>Little did the canny Scot of the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> imagine that in that bold confession he was putting beyond dispute the damaging documents found on the dead body of <persName n="Dahlgren,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00173" reg="mostcommon:Dahlgren,nomatch:0"><surname>Dahlgren</surname></persName>, and which he had reason to suppose would never see the light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>If the raid had been successful, the atrocities committed here would have been apologized for on the ground that the officers were unable to restrain the troops; if successful, nothing, it was supposed, would ever be heard of the papers of the expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>But, unluckily for the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, the documents were found, and now, when their mouthpiece, the <hi rend="italics">Herald,</hi> would pronounce them a Confederate forgery, it has spiked its own guns by its own imprudent and boastful declaration of the purposes of <persName n="Kilpatrick,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00174" reg="mostcommon:Kilpatrick,nomatch:0"><surname>Kilpatrick</surname></persName>'s expedition. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/> The Confederate press, with all its caution, has not yet seen the danger of publishing statements and comments upon events which have transpired, especially in regard to the numbers engaged on our side in battles and combats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>It is natural that correspondents and others should desire to crown with laurels those heroes who gain victories against <num value="3">three</num> times their numbers; but it is the obvious dictate of prudence to let the enemy remain in the dark as to our actual strength, and draw his own conclusions from results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>Otherwise, in order to obtain a knowledge of our numbers, he has only to make a demonstration, retire, and await the announcement by our own journals of the exact number in his front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>He can then repeat the experiment with a force large enough to overwhelm all resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>In regard to the defences of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, it has been stated that, but for the fire of <orgName n="battalion"><persName n="Henley,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00175" reg="mostcommon:Henley,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Henley</surname></persName>'s battalion</orgName>, they would have entered the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>It is perhaps fortunate for us that the enemy's spies, of whom there are no doubt scores in this city, have probably given him by this time more accurate information, and that he is sure that if <orgName n="battalion"><persName n="Henley,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00176" reg="mostcommon:Henley,nomatch:0"><surname>Henley</surname></persName>'s battalion</orgName> had been driven back he would have run upon a succession of snags, which would have sent him in double-quick time to the bottom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>We apprehend, however, no injury from this direction now, if it should tempt him to repeat the experiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>But <unclear></unclear> to say nothing of the numbers by which our victories are accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>Let him console himself, if he see fit, with the idea that he is defeated by overwhelming numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>The great object is to defeat him, and the accomplishment of that ought to satisfy us for the present. </p> </div3>

<head><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00177" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s amnesty.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/> The only reasonable explanation of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00178" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s motives in offering the <rs>South</rs> an amnesty which is an insult and outrage to the common humanity and common sense of mankind is that suggested by an English correspondent in the <rs>North</rs>, and which is substantially this: The Washington Administration desires to protract the war in order to make its plots for the extermination of the <rs>South</rs> a continual military necessity, swallowing up all questions of constitutional powers, and to ripen into political uses the appetites of the <rs>Northern</rs> people, which is fast growing into a national passion for seizing and dividing among themselves the whole property and land of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>For these ends military operations are designedly delayed, and peace offered only upon such terms that any extremity of resistance, however hopeless of success, would be preferable to submission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>Such at all events is the opinion of many people at the <rs>North</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/> Look for a moment at the terms usually offered by civilized and Christian Princes wherever acknowledged rebellion has been thoroughly crushed, and the triumphant Sovereign instead of calling for <num value="500000">500,000</num> additional troops is reducing his army to a peace establishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>Death perhaps to a few of the ringleaders, and banishment of a handful of others, and confiscation of their property; or, if the rebellion, though unsuccessful, has still some elements of vitality, even greater clemency is exhibited, while, in the case of a civil war, where the probabilities are that the struggle will be long and doubtful, no <name>Christian</name> ruler ever dreams of offering any other terms than the entire abandonment of all criminal proceedings against any of the parties to the contest and the restoration of all to their previous <hi rend="italics">status</hi> in every respect before the war began. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/> What then are the terms which <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00179" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> offers?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>He excepts from his amnesty a host of the best citizens of the <rs>South</rs> in the army and in civil life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>To others he offers a free pardon upon condition that they will take an oath not only of allegiance to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> but of obedience to all the proclamations of <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00180" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, and to all the abolition decrees of his <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>And these terms he offers not to acknowledged rebels but to sovereign States, not to a crushed rebellion but to a powerful Government, which has in the field an army so strong that, after calling for more than <num value="2000000">two millions</num> of men to crush it, and failing in the effort, he is now calling for half a <num value="1000000">million</num> more in the same breath that he professes to treat the <rs>Confederacy</rs> as a conquered people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/> Is it not evident upon the mere statement of the case that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00181" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s amnesty was never expected or designed by himself to have any other effect than irritation and insult to the <rs>Southern</rs> people?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>No <num value="1">one</num>, however, knows better than <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00182" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> that any terms he might offer the <rs>Southern</rs> people which contemplate their restoration to his bloody and brutal Government would be rejected with scorn and execration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>If instead of devoting to death our <rs type="role2">President</rs> and military and civil officers he had proposed to make <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00183" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName n="Jefferson">Jeff.</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> his successor, <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00184" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> commander-in-chief of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> armies, and our domestic institutions not only recognized at home but re-adopted in the <rs>Free States</rs>, provided the <rs>South</rs> would once more enter the <orgName n="Yankee Union" type="union">Yankee Union</orgName>, there is not a man, woman or child in the <rs>Confederacy</rs> who would not spit upon the proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>We desire no companionship upon any terms with a nation of robbers and murderers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>The miscreants whose atrocities in this war have caused the whole civilized world to shudder, must keep henceforth their distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>They shall not be our masters, and we would not have them for our slaves. </p> </div3>

<head>Demoralization.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/> We hear a great deal about the demoralizing effects of the war in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>Doubtless this is true to a certain extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>But, in the main, this war, like all other wars, has simply revealed the native tiger and beast in human nature &mdash; not created it. It has, as a French friend of ours used to pronounce the word, &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">devil-up</hi>&#x0022; the character of the community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>The men who are now so openly bad, the monsters who are so bloodthirsty, the speculators who are so ravenous, the tyrants who are so cruel, were always bad, ravenous, bloody, and cruel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>The war has simply thrown the broad glare of a policemen's lantern upon midnight prowlers, rogues, and murderers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>It has simply torn the veil from the character of men, and revealed them for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time to the world, and perhaps to themselves. &#x0022;Is thy servant a dog, that he should do this thing?&#x0022; said Hazael, when the man of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> predicted the atrocities he should commit in his future career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>Yet he was a dog though he knew it not, and so the dogs of the present war were always dogs, possessed of all the vile instincts which the war has simply developed and disclosed to their own eyes and those of the world.--They need not charge the war with their demoralization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>The war has only found them out, and made patent the original and inherent corruption of their character. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/> But, when we talk of the demoralization of the war, has not the war done something the other way?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>Has it not revealed good qualities as well as bad, and introduced to the world and to themselves virtuous as well as evil men?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>Has it not disclosed in the almost unknown <persName n="Lee,,Robert,E.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00185" reg="default:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><foreName>Robert</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> a closer resemblance to <persName n="Washington,,George,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00186" reg="default:Washington,George,,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName> than we had supposed humanity could ever again furnish?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>But for the war, <persName n="Jackson,,Stonewall,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00187" reg="default:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><foreName>Stonewall</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> might have gone to his grave an obscure professor in the <orgName n="Virginia Military Institute" type="institute">Virginia Military Institute</orgName>, ignorant, in his saintlike humility, of those wonderful qualities which have filled the world with the glory of his name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>And what a host of virtuous and heroic deeds has this war elicited in the citizen soldiery of the <rs>South</rs>, deeds which are innumerable as the stars of Heaven, and which would never have been seen but for the darkness that has covered the sky!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>Like the ordeal of the last Judgment, the war has separated the wheat from the tares, the sheep from the goats, the just from the unjust, and revealed all men to themselves and to the world in their real character. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/> In your prolonged absence from home, your sacrifice of personal interests and of all the enjoyments of life has indeed, been great.--The war, forced upon us by the malice of a people whom we had not injured, has entailed upon us all deep sorrow and cruel suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>Its unavoidable calamities have been greatly augmented by the refusal of the enemy to respect the laws of civilized warfare, and by their fiendish attempt to wrest submission from us by visiting he most relentless barbarities upon women and children, the aged and the helpless.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/> Thanks to the gallantry of a citizen soldiery, they were routed and repulsed in the midst of this carnival of crime, which must outrage the sensibilities of the civilized world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>We are assured that you fully comprehend the necessity of a successful assertion of that right, and that you will never lay down your arms until you have secured it. Born to an inheritance of freedom, you cannot hesitate to choose between slavery or death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>Submission to an enemy who has exhausted every infamy is not endurable even in thought; but were we base enough to desire peace upon any terms less than the unqualified recognition of our independence, self-interest alone would teach us the folly of relying upon the forbearance of a nation, who have shown in every step of the war that their faith is perfidy, and their only pulley is rapine, plunder and oppression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>The whole history of our former association with the <rs>Northern States</rs> admonishes us that in a common Government they will never fall to employ their power to take away our property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>Their present malice springs chiefly from harried cupidity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>But for this master passion of their nature, an honorable and speedy peace would be easy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>And to these, yourselves, your wives and children will be menial laborers and slaves, except those of you whom the malice of your enemies shall reserve for the dungeon or the gallows. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/> Such is the doom denounced for the people of the <rs>South</rs> by the wicked race now warring upon us. But we know it can never be executed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>An army of veterans have resolved that their country shall not be enslaved; and while their purpose stands the enemy's designs will continue to be baffled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>The temper of the army has reached the people at home, and inspired them with a fresh courage and a more assured confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>Everywhere we see multiplied evidences of enemy and enthusiasm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>In all the <name>States</name> we find the resolution to endure every extremity rather than submit, and with this spirit our people are invincible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>The armies are filling up their ranks, and the legislation of Congress has added still further to their numbers and efficiency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>Those citizens who remain at home to carry on the industrial pursuits essential to the support of the army will see to it that you shall not want for food while you are exposing your lives to protect their property and homes from rapine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>The defence of the country has become its business, and every citizen is required to contribute to it in his proper sphere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>The <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName> of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> has taken steps to aid those families of her soldiers who may be in want, and it will not fall to do all in its power to provide for and cherish them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>Individually and collectively, in county, city, and State organizations, the people with <num value="1">one</num> accord are determined to feed, clothe sustain and cherish the army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/> On the other hand, your enemies are appalled by the magnitude of the task before them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>The loud boasting which a few weeks since they so freely uttered, have been silenced by your unanimous re-enlistments for the war, and the stern and resolute bearing of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>Eager to possess the spots of their corrupt and profligate Government, they hate each other nearly as much as they do us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/> The war is no longer popular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>The rich are allowed to buy an exemption, and thus cast all the burden and risk upon the poor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>The laboring classes have already revolted against the draft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>To escape its odium, enormous bounties have been offered to volunteers; but all these expedients have failed, and again a heavy draft has been ordered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>The armies of the enemy are every day diminishing, and it is evident they cannot recruit them to the numbers with which they began the struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>A large and growing party are for peace.
