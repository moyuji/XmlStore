<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>This will seem to be the more essential when we state that a gentlemanly stranger quietly wending his way through our streets yesterday, with a <hi rend="italics">black</hi> cockade in his beaver, attracted a good deal of notice, and for ought we know, may have experienced some annoyance, from the popular belief that the color he had mounted was an indication of <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> proclivities.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> This is altogether a mistake, at least in this section of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>All the taunts and sneers that the <name>Tribune</name> or other sheets of that stamp could print for a year would have not the slightest effect in exciting or irritating our people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>They have other and graver matters to attend to than the coarse and stupid witticisms of the malign slanders of such a press.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>They are passing from <num value="1">one</num> condition to another and higher &mdash; that of a people disenthralled from the political rule of spoilers, cut-throats, and fanatics. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Men attend to their ordinary business as usual; new buildings are going up all around us; the merchant, mechanic and tradesman are all busy, and a passer-by could scarcely discover a political ripple on the surface of every-day life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>But <num value="1">one</num> thing the most casual observer cannot fail to notice, and that is, the marked, though calm, determination which has settled upon all that the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">State of South Carolina</placeName> must at once withdraw from the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>They ask that the <rs>Northern States</rs> repeal all such enactments as in any way interfere with the operation of the <rs>Federal</rs> laws in reference to fugitives from labor.--This is not an unreasonable request, and it should be cheerfully and frankly complied with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The tenor of most of these State laws has been much misrepresented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>But this matters little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Even if the laws were meaningless and inoperative, yet if their titles or phraseology are offensive to our Southern fellow-citizens, if by any forced construction they could be made to appear hostile to them, let them be blotted out of the statute books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>This is no time for punctilio.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The Union is in danger, and the people of the free States can afford to make many sacrifices to save it. They should promptly and cheerfully comply with the demand made by the <rs>South</rs> to repeal every law that can possibly be construed into an interference with the <rs>Federal</rs> laws or a design upon the property of Southern citizens. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> We think we can safely promise that the <rs>Pennsylvania Legislature</rs>, which is to meet in <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct> next, will, without delay, repeal the statute of <dateStruct value="1847--"><year reg="1847">1847</year></dateStruct>, which, although having no reference to the present Fugitive Slave law, is still an offence to the people of the <rs>South</rs>.--It is almost a dead letter as it is, and its continuance is not needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>But even if it were, we could readily give it up, for the sake of restoring peace to the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The same may be said of the laws passed by other States, some of which are far more severe than ours, and were enacted with special reference to the <rs>Fugitive Slave</rs> law. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/> It is doubtful whether the repeal of these laws will satisfy all the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Still, as it is demanded by many Southern people as the only thing that can tend to abate the present excitement, we should yield to the demand.--Those who advocated the election of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, should advocate such repeals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>They owe it to the man whom they have called to a place of such mighty responsibility, that they should, as far as is possible, remove all obstacles in the way of a peaceful and successful administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>If these offensive statutes remain unrepealed --supposing even that there be no secession &mdash; they would still be causes of disagreement and quarreling during his whole term of office, and would seriously interfere with his efforts to govern the country properly and peacefully. </p> </q><bibl n="The Philadelphia Bulletin"></bibl></cit> </div3>

<head>Something about dogs.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/> Having written quite a dissertation upon hunting and game, we feel somewhat called upon to incite something upon dogs &mdash; the life of sport, the agent without whose aid it could not exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>The genuine sportsman loves his dog next to his wife and children, if he have any. Some have even been accused of loving them a great deal better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>It may be so, for we have observed that the majority of ladies are by no means fond of dogs, and we presume it a because they are jealous of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>They feel a secret consciousness that they divide, if they do not absolutely steal away, the affections of their lords and masters, and anything that does that is sure not to be a favorite. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/> We never saw a sportsman who did not, at the time, possess, or had not at some period of his career possessed, a dog superior to all other dogs that ever existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>Every man has innumerable anecdotes to record of his dog.--Every <num value="1">one</num> gives you some dozen instances of his wonderful sagacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>They all tell you, that at such a time they owned a dog who had as much sense as a man. You assent in silence, with the conviction that some of them have a great deal more than <hi rend="italics">some</hi> men. Some of them have dogs which can do everything but talk, which, again, is more than the masters can generally do. <num value="1">One</num> dog, you will be told, understands conversation, wherein we confess they surpass our humble selves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>Another knows how to draw a conclusion; an effort to which we are at times very far from being equal ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>That you may not doubt, examples of this dog logic are always ready at hand, and they are always vouched for by the owner, with a vehemence proportioned to the importance of the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/><hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Byron</foreName></persName>,</hi> being a <unclear></unclear> himself, pronounces dogs <hi rend="italics">better</hi> than men. Many sportsmen will <hi rend="italics">prove</hi> that they are at least <hi rend="italics">smarter.</hi> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/> The races of dogs are almost as innumerable as the races of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>You have well-bred dogs and dogs of no breeding at all, intelligent dogs and dogs without any brains' sharp dogs and dull dogs, cross dogs and good-natured dogs, bob-tailed dogs, long-tailed dogs, and dogs without any tail, hounds, bloodhounds, greyhounds, pointers, setters, bulls, mastiffs, Newfoundlands, poodles, St. Bernards, terriers, curs, and fices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>These are a few of the generations, but they branch out into innumerable secondary breeds and classes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/> It was said long ago by a person who took great delight in field sports, <q>&#x0022;treat your dog like a gentleman, if you want to make anything of him.&#x0022;</q> This is true of all dogs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>It is more strictly true, perhaps, of pointers, than of any others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>They must be treated with the utmost kindness, kept warm, fed well, and placed on a footing with the family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>Beat a pointer unnecessarily, kick him, scold him, give him never a word of encouragement, and his spirit is soon broken.--He becomes worthless, lazy, and sheepish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>He loses the erectness of his walk and the spirit of his carriage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>He comes crawling up to you with averted eyes, and countenance resembling that of a felon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>Indeed, you must keep a sharp look-out, lest he become a felon in deed as well as in look.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>If you will kick your pointer, you should at least secure your sheep-pen.--On the contrary, if you treat him well, he is always full of life and spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>He starts up when he hears your voice, and shows his pleasure by a <num value="1000">thousand</num> antics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>He becomes your constant companion and your most useful servant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1092"/>He says this session of the <name>Legislature</name> is doubly important, as it will have to pave the way for direct trade with <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and advises that the <rs>State</rs> shall foster enterprises for such a purpose by guaranteeing the projectors <num value="0.05">5 per cent</num>, on investments they may make.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1093"/>Referring to postal matters, he says he is authorized by the <rs>Postmaster</rs> at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> to say that in case the <rs>State</rs> secedes he will cover his connection with the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, and offer his services to the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1095"/>He further suggests a probable arrangement between <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> and the <rs>Federal Government</rs> for a given time, or until the other States secede and a <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> is formed.--If the <rs>Federal Government</rs> insists upon considering <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> in the <rs>Union</rs> after she shall have adopted the ordinance of secession, then this postal arrangement shall cease, and another by the <rs>State</rs> be substituted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1096"/> The Governor advises the prohibition of the introduction of slaves from States not members of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, and particularly from the border States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1097"/>He says: <q>&#x0022;Let them keep their slaves within their own borders, and their only alternatives will be, emancipation by their own act, or by the action of their Confederation.&#x0022;</q> He hopes, however, that all the slaveholding States will unite in a <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1098"/>He advises the passage of the most ample and stringent laws against the <name>Abolition</name> incendiaries to supercede lynching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1099"/>It will deter violations to make the enforcement of the law reliable and severe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1100"/>The Governor, referring to the action of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> in sending <persName n="Memminger,the Honorable,C.,C.,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00531" reg="default:Memminger,C.,C.,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">Hon.</roleName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Memminger</surname></persName> to <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and his failure to obtain the co-operation of that State for a <orgName n="Southern Conference" type="conference">Southern Conference</orgName>, also the failure of the <rs>Commissioner</rs> from <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, says all hopes of a concert of action on the part of the <rs>Southern States</rs> is lost, and there is but <num value="1">one</num> course left to <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, consistently with her honor, interest, and safety, and that is, to look neither to the right or to the left, but to go straight forward to the consummation of her purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1101"/>It is too late now to receive propositions for a Conference, and <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> would be wanting in self-respect to entertain a proposition looking to a continuance of the present Union. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1102"/> The Governor entertains no reasonable doubt that <placeName key="tgn,7007248" n="1.000 4" reg="georgia">Georgia, Alabama</placeName>, <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> and <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>, will immediately follow South Caroline, and the other Southern States will eventually complete the galaxy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1103"/>It is gratifying to know that if a resort to arms be necessary, we have the tender of volunteers from all the <rs>Southern</rs> and some of the <rs>Northern States</rs>, to repair promptly to the standard and share the fortunes of <orgName type="college" n="Carolina college">Carolina</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1750"/> Nevertheless, my anguish returned when I felt that sleep was stealing over me; at my age, it is impossible to resist it. Was I to go and lie down by the side of the body?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1751"/>My resolution did not carry me so far as that; and I sought, I must confess, a very wretched protection from the superstitious fears which were resuming their sway; I went and took refuge by the side of Blanchette.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1752"/>The warmth and the vital motion which I found in this poor animal, the slight noise she made while chewing the cud, reassured me in some slight degree. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1753"/> At last I fell into a sound sleep. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1754"/> The next day, as soon as I woke, I recollected the struggle of yesterday; I employed myself as much as possible about the goal and my other work, and, above all, I frequently went near to the body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1755"/>I even held that dear and venerable head for a considerable time in my hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1756"/>The more my fear diminished, the more I felt my grief increase; and I was pleased with myself on observing so reasonable and so natural a change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1757"/>My thoughts then became directed to the preparations for the burial, and I recalled to mind what my grandfather had said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1758"/>I believe that it was with a secret intention that he had sometimes spoken of the dangers of precipitate interments; I resolved, therefore, to wait until nature should compel me to accomplish this last duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1759"/>The lively affection which I retained for my grandfather kept me from yielding to the cowardly wish to get rid of a painful spectacle at the very earliest moment possible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1760"/> But I took my tools, and opened the dairy door. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1761"/> <q>&#x0022;What a Jack-of-all-trades!&#x0022;</q> I said to myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1762"/><q>&#x0022;<num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, nurse and doctor, and now gravedigger!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1763"/>What other bereaved relatives are spared the sight of, I am obliged to execute with my own hands!&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1764"/> The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> few strokes revolted me, and I was obliged to stop short.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1765"/>It was not that my arms refused to work, but my mind was troubled, and deprived me of the requisite energy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1766"/>Every time I struck the ground, a loud echo resounded from the roof, which was vaulted with bricks, like that of a cellar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1767"/>I was obliged to accustom myself to the sound, and it took me the whole day to do an amount of work which ought not to have occupied more than a couple of hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1768"/>In fact, the ground is sandy and light, and at last I was able to throw it out with the shovel without being obliged to break it up previously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1769"/>I took advantage of the circumstance to dig a deep grave; for &mdash; I said to myself &mdash; If the chalet has to be felt empty for any length of time (whether I escape from it, or whether it is my turn to die next, I ought to use my utmost endeavors to preserve the body from ravenous beasts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1770"/>I therefore went on with my melancholy task, until I was standing in a grave as deep as I was high.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1771"/>The clock struck <num value="10">ten</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1772"/>Night was come, and all its black thoughts with it. But the violent exercise which I had taken soon enabled me to fall asleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1773"/>It was only deferred a few minutes by Blanchette's caresses; she seems very glad to have me with her, and never refuses to serve as my pillow. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1774"/> On the <date value="01-11">11th of January,</date> my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thought on waking was to make an end of my painful task; when I had lighted the lamp I felt my courage oozing away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1775"/>I was obliged to have recourse to a new remedy with which I ought to have been able to dispense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1776"/>Instead of breakfasting as usual on boiled milk and potatoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1777"/>I took a little bread and wine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1778"/>This regimen restored a certain degrees of firmness which I cannot ascribe to my own personal character, but of which I took advantage without delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1779"/>I had well considered the means of execution, and every thing had been prepared the day before. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1780"/> On, my dear grandfather, when you taught me, in front of your house, to transport a heavy body by the employment of rollers, we little thought that I should apply your lessons on so sad an occasion as this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1781"/>The remembrance of what you then told me was completely refreshed in my memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1782"/>I could hear the sound of your voice, in imagination; and when the funeral burden nodded its head, as if in sign of approbation, I was so overcome that I turned my eyes away, like a person who dreads to look over the brink of a precipices. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1783"/> The way was smoothed: the body was soon beside the grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1784"/>The most easy way would have been to let it fall in; but I could not make up my mind to treat it with so little reverence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1785"/>Every difficulty being vanquished at last, what then remained to be done gave me but little uneasiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1786"/>I could freely give way to my grief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1787"/>Seated on the mound which I had raised with my own hands, I wept abundantly by the side of that open grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1788"/>I could not resolve to throw in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shovelfuls of earth without performing some sort of funeral service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1789"/>I knelt, and searched my memory for passages of Scripture suitable to the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1790"/>I took the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>, being sufficiently acquainted with it to find fitting portions, and such as my grandfather would have pointed out. While reading aloud, it appeared to me as if I had quitted my solitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1791"/>The holy volume responded to my emotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1792"/>At last I stopped, through exhaustion; I collected my thoughts, and no longer deferred what remained to be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1793"/>In a short space of time, the grave was filled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1794"/>I spent the rest of the day in carving with the point of my knife the following inscription on a small tablet of maple-wood: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1795"/> Here rests the body of <persName n="Lopez,,Louis,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00910" reg="default:Lopez,Louis,,,"><foreName>Louis</foreName> <surname>Lopez</surname></persName>, who died in the night of the <num value="7" type="ordinal">7th</num> <date value="01-08">8th of January,</date> in the arms of his grandson <persName n="Lopez,,Louis,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00911" reg="default:Lopez,Louis,,,"><foreName>Louis</foreName> <surname>Lopez</surname></persName>, who buried him with his own hands. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1796"/> I nailed the tablet to a stake, which I planted on the mound over the grave; after which I closed the door and returned to the kitchen, where Blanchette is my only company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1797"/>Nevertheless, although I feel more at ease now the body is no longer lying on the bed, I find that some remains of weakness still linger in my mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1798"/>I combat them by paying frequent visits to the grave, and always without a light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1828"/>She yielded still less milk, and I had the vexation of hearing her bleat half the day. It is now not worth while milking her twice a day; so I have waited till the evening, in order to get a little more.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1854"/> Yesterday morning, Blanchette's bleating woke me out of a frightful dream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1855"/>I thought I was standing, with bloody hands, cutting up the poor animal's quivering flesh; her head lay before me; I could nevertheless hear it utter cries of pain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1856"/>These were what actually did strike my ear. I awoke with my cheeks streaming with tears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1857"/>How delighted I was to behold Blanchette still living ! I ran up to her; she was more affectionate than ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1858"/>My joy was not of long duration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1859"/>I remembered that destitution stared me in the face; indecision was impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1860"/>I took a knife, and set to work to sharpen it on the hearthstone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1861"/>I was at my wits' end; I felt as if I were going to commit a murder; and, after advancing unsteadily for the purpose of giving the fatal blow, I stopped short, overpowered by feelings of remorse. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1862"/> My hands were benumbed with cold, another reason for deferring the act which inspired me with such disgust and repugnance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1863"/>I lighted a good fire, and pondered as I warmed myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1864"/><q>&#x0022;If the wolves can travel over the snow,&#x0022;</q> it suddenly struck me, <q>&#x0022;why should not we travel over it as well !&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1865"/> This idea thrilled me with joy; then fear stole over my mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1866"/>I was about to surrender myself to those ravenous brutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1867"/>To avoid making Blanchette my prey, I was exposing myself to become the prey or wolves ! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1868"/> And, if I kill the goat &mdash; I afterwards considered &mdash; am I sure that her flesh will suffice for my support until the moment of deliverance?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1869"/>I have sometimes seen the <name>Jura</name> all covered with white quite into the summer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1870"/>I must not lose the opportunity now offered while the snow is frozen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1871"/>That the wolves will attack us during our course, is far from a certainty; for, if I start, our pace will be rapid, we will descend in a sledge ! </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1879"/>It should be remembered by all that a cold never comes without a cause, and that in <num value="4">four</num> times out of <num value="5">five</num> it is the result of leaving off exercise too suddenly, or of remaining still in the wind, or in a cooler atmosphere than that in which the exercise has been taken. </p>
