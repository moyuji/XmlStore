<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Since their advent to this hospitable place they have experienced the kindest and most flattering attentions from the inhabitants of the town and county, and their sojourn here will remain a <q>&#x0022;green spot in memory.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> The <num value="5" type="ordinal">5th</num> seems to be looked to from all quarters as the regiment in which heroic deeds and daring acts are to be performed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The well known chivalry and comprehensive mind of its commander give it a <q>&#x0022;prestige&#x0022;</q> <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> to none in the <rs>Southern Army</rs>, while the superior acquirements of its officers, the high qualifications of its surgeons, and the vigor and ingenuity displayed in both <rs type="role2">Quartermaster</rs>'s and <rs type="role2">Commissary</rs>'s departments, together with decided evidence of <hi rend="italics">metal</hi> in the men, constitute all that is required for success in the field. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>His eagle eye, penetrating the dim distance, saw in advance the calamities which were to befall our beloved country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>His clarion voice sounded the warning, and though the cry was at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> unheeded, and many mocked at the call, he unwaveringly pursued the course best calculated to encourage the authorities to act in behalf of Southern rights, and largely helped to shape the sentiments of the people on this important question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The State has shown her confidence in his patriotism by the loud call made from all directions for his appointment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> As <rs n="Powhatan" type="nativeamerican">Powhatan</rs> has been somewhat taunted for not having done her duty in the present emergencies, I will take pleasure in giving you a correct account of what she has been doing in maintaining the honor and defending the rights of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The entire strength of our militia, including the various volunteer companies, is only <num value="342">342</num>, and out of that number we have <num value="90">90</num> in the <rs n="Powhatan" type="nativeamerican">Powhatan</rs> Troop which has been in the service more than <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> and are highly honored in being the body guard of <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>, and we are assured that in material and discipline, it is not surpassed by any troop in the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Then we have the <rs n="Powhatan" type="nativeamerican">Powhatan</rs> Rifles, numbering <num value="65">65</num>, which I am sorry to see suffered severely at <placeName reg="Laurel Hill, Lunenburg, Virginia" key="tgn,2484557">Laurel Hill</placeName>, whilst they were gallantly contending against the superior numbers of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>And last, but not least, is <persName n="Dance,Captain,W.,J.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="default:Dance,W.,J.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>Dance</surname></persName>'s <orgName n="Artillery Company" type="company">Artillery company</orgName>, numbering <num value="75">75</num>, which was mustered into service yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>The Lord Ordinary (Ardmillan) having heard counsel on these appeals, issued an <q>&#x0022;interlocutor&#x0022;</q> on Thursday disposing of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>There are only <num value="2">two</num> points of importance involved in the appeals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>His Lordship has found that in respect it is alleged by the pursuer, as a ground of action, that marriage was constituted by cohabitation and habit and repute, it is competent to prove what was the opinion formed at the time by witnesses having the opportunity of observing the conduct and conversation of parties in regard to the footing on which the pursuer and defender lived together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>Accordingly, he dismisses the appeals for the defender against all evidence of that character, and the effect of the judgment, it sustained, will be to admit some important testimony for the pursuer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>The other point affects the right of the pursuer herself to be examined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>In an action of this kind, by the law of <placeName key="tgn,7002444" n="1.000 148" reg="scotland">Scotland</placeName>, the parties themselves cannot be admitted to the witness' box, but the pursuer seeks to have her evidence received as to the loss of certain documents, with the view of being allowed to prove their contents by parole testimony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>The Lord Ordinary holds that this application is without precedent or authority, and that the evidence is not admissible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>His Lordship remarks that his disposition in the case has been to admit evidence as fully and unreservedly as is consistent with the settled principles of the law, and in doubtful points to lean towards admission rather than exclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>The necessary refusal of the pursuer's own testimony is, however, a serious disadvantage to her in the <rs n="Scotch" type="political">Scotch</rs> suit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>It is understood that the present interlocutor is to be reclaimed to the <rs>Inner House</rs>, and the taking of proof for the defender before the <rs>Commissioner</rs> is suspended till the reclaiming note is disposed of.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/> The Southern trade cannot be conquered back by bayonets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>Humanity under a Southern sky, or any other sky, cannot fall as low as that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>The people does not exist on the face of the earth who are so degraded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>If the <rs>Southern</rs> trade can be conquered back by bayonets, then the <rs>Southern</rs> people are the most abject and slavish of all the beings that Heaven has ever made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>If the bayonets could conquer our country and deprive us of all political and civil privileges, that very fact would make it impossible to conquer back any other thing which we have the power to withhold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>And when <num value="1">one</num> such thing--Southern trade &mdash; is the very motive and mainspring of this outrageous war, that is the very thing which, above all others, our enemies shall never possess again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>That vengeance lies in our power, and if we did not gratify it we would be less than men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/> We must show the <rs>North</rs>, now, at the outset, that they do not understand this people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>They think that they do; they say we are an indolent, impulsive, self-indulgent race; that we are brave, but vain-glorious and boastful; easily elated and easily depressed; warm in our affections, warm in our hates, but fickle as the moon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>They propose to whip us soundly, and expect us, after an outburst of passionate, but impotent rage, to forget it soon; to buy of them again, rather than take the trouble to manufacture for ourselves; to find consolation in the solid comforts of good eating and drinking, and buy our calicoes and raise our cotton for the benefit and behoof of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> lords and masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>We can only undeceive them by the most decisive means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>Nothing short of such measures as those already resolved upon in the <rs>Cotton States</rs> will ever dispel the delusions in the <rs>Northern</rs> mind about Southern character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>We have already announced the determination, in our principal seaboard cotton marts, to receive no more cotton, where it can be exposed to seizure by the enemy, but that each planter will keep it on his estate, and burn and destroy it rather than permit it to fall into the enemy's hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>This is the policy which the <rs>South</rs> must at once make up its mind to pursue, at every mile of progress which the enemy may make into our territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>If we cannot keep him out, we must devastate and lay waste every farm, and burn every city which he expects to capture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>Rather than permit our own beautiful <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 7" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> to fall into his hands, we must rise to at least the elevation of <persName n="Russian,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00075" reg="mostcommon:Russian,nomatch:0"><surname>Russian</surname></persName> patriotism, and reduce it to ashes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>Every part of the garden before the <rs>Northern</rs> march must be turned into a desert; let him see that a wilderness is to be his only spoils, and he will soon tire of the murderous crusade for Southern money which he has begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>For no murder for money was ever committed which had about it more of the elements of murder, and was prompted by more cold-blooded greed of gold, and more reckless disregard of the life and property of others, than this most wicked and mercenary war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/> Suppose, then, that <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00076" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abe,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName></hi> succeeds in raising his <num value="400000000">four hundred millions</num> of dollars and his <num value="400000">four hundred thousand</num> men; and suppose, also, that with these he succeeds in subjugating the <rs>South</rs>, how will the <rs>North</rs> reimburse itself for the expenses of the war?--It cannot fall back on trade; it cannot compel us to work our cotton fields for its benefit; it cannot prevent us from making the whole cotton country a desert, and sacrificing ourselves and all that we have for our country.--It cannot compel our negroes to labor for any but their present masters; nor, if it could, can any others intelligently direct their labors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>Its own people cannot live in a cotton-growing climate, and every experiment of raising cotton by free labor has hitherto failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>We know they say that the <rs>South</rs> will think better of all this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>We can almost see the self-complacent smile with which they declare that they understand the impulsive <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>If they do, we do not, and the whole result depends upon which estimate of Southern character is correct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>We, for our part, feel sure that a people whose mothers give up their sons, and whose wives their husbands, with pride and joy, to the battle field, will withhold nothing else from the altar of Patriotism and Retribution. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/> True heroism is exhibited by the conduct under reverses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>That nation does not deserve liberty who will consent to surrender it upon a single defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>True courage consists in the bravery which is shown amidst circumstances of danger and desperation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>A coward may be brave when the danger is only nominal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>The present is a time which tests the true qualities of men. The patriot may feel oppressed with concern for the <rs>Southern</rs> cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>He may be anxious to sadness and gloominess; but he does not once conceive the thought of giving up the cause of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>His resolve to fight on, fight over, is only strengthened by evil news; and the announcement of defeat is to him only a notice to be ready for another struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>This fixed resolve, this unshakable purpose, is the true touchstone of loyalty in the present crisis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>The true man thinks of nothing but of fight and resistance to the last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>Such is not the case with the time-serving and disloyal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>These take thought only of how they would ingratiate themselves with the enemy, if he should succeed in overrunning us. It matters little to them which side shall win. They have principles for either fortune of war. They can be as obsequious to the enemy as hypocritical towards the cause of the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/> The few weeks immediately before us, will be weeks big with the fate of the country, and may be checkered by varying fortune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>The independence of the <rs>South</rs> may be lost or won in these weeks for a long time to come; and we should put forth every exertion to make good our success in the contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>We believe that these weeks will be a period of victory and glory to Southern arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>The enemy outnumbers us in men; but we have the advantage of him in position, in the spirit which animates our ranks, and in the cause for which we fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>We believe, too, that we have the advantage over him in generalship; and we have unbounded confidence in our troops, provided only they be not sacrificed by incompetent commanders. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/> But with all this confidence in our troops, we must recollect that fortune is always fickle in war, and that mere accidents often decide the result of battles and of campaigns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>We should be prepared to receive with composure any fortune that may be in store for our arms, and be ready promptly to do all in our power to improve a victory or to repair a defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>Every patriot should be on the alert to encourage the desponding and to advance the efforts of authority to put the affairs of the community in the best position of defence. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/> There is no doubt that the enemy is actuated by a very bitter feeling of animosity towards <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> Virginia</placeName>, and especially towards the city of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 7" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>How anybody in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 7" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> can entertain the belief of escaping uninjured, in case the enemy should make his way this far, is past comprehension.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>If there is any city in the <rs>South</rs> which they would sack and pillage it would be this very town of ours, so beautiful, so wealthy, so true to the <rs>Southern</rs> cause, and by its manufactures so far surpassing all other places in its capacity for furnishing munitions of war for Southern defence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/> Even the disloyal class of our people would be heavy sufferers by such a misfortune, and, like the <name>Submissionists</name> in <placeName key="tgn,2119828" n="1.000 34" reg="romney, hampshire, west virginia">Romney</placeName> and <placeName reg="Martinsburg, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119135">Martinsburg</placeName>, would find themselves robbed and outraged along with the rest of the community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>An unscrupulous and lawless soldiery would not stop to inquire of the antecedents of the owner of a splendid mansion, filled with costly plate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>It would be sufficient for them to know that he was an Eastern <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginian</rs> and a Richmonder, to commence upon him the work of plunder. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/> In view of all the contingencies that may happen in a short time, it behooves our authorities to push forward the defences of the city with all the force and energy possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>It behooves the people of the country to be prompt and active in providing themselves with all the means of annoying an invader in their power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>A few trees judiciously felled across roads, a few ambuscades of sharp-shooters behind fences and trees, an active system of guerilla annoyance, would go very far to check an invading column, to demoralize and discomfit it in its plan of operations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/> Now is the time for the whole community to be up and doing, and for every true man to put himself in readiness for the field. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/> If it could affect this result by arousing the people to a full state of alacrity and preparation, a reverse in the field might prove of great service to our cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>It is from victories that over-confidence proceeds, which is often the <name>Precursor</name> of misfortune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/> At the late annual meeting of the <orgName n="Virginia Baptist General Association" type="association">Baptist General Association of Virginia</orgName>, it was determined at once to send <q>&#x0022;colporteurs to occupy all the important points of rendezvous, and promptly to reach all the soldiers in service in this State.&#x0022;</q> In pursuance of this plan, I was directed to appeal for aid to <q>&#x0022;such persons in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> as may feel interested in the spiritual welfare of the soldiers who are gathered from various Southern States to fight their common battles on the soil of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/> There are now, in all probability, not less than <num value="150000">150,000</num> soldiers of the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate Army</orgName> within the limits of our State, and the course of events indicates that, in a few months, we shall have double that number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>Very many of these brave men have not the <name>Word</name> of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>Our colporteurs have found many companies in which <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> are destitute of a copy of the New Testament, while in almost every company a considerable proportion have neglected to bring with them this invaluable treasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>There is great anxiety on the part of our soldiers to secure religious reading.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>In many instances they have called upon clergymen in this city and begged for a supply of Testaments and tracts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>But they have, to a large extent, begged in vain, as nearly all our religious literature, including Bibles, Testaments, and tracts, has been published at the <rs>North</rs>, and now we cannot obtain a supply from that quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>Feeling that the <rs>South</rs> must build up a Christian literature for herself, and that no foreign growth in this respect can answer her home necessities, we are publishing large editions of tracts in this city, especially adapted to soldiers, and expect soon to bring out an edition of the New Testament. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/> We have pious, devoted and experienced colporteurs, who are anxious to be sent into this inviting field, and to gather sheaves unto eternal life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>Already <num value="30">thirty</num> are laboring in this capacity under our direction, and their reports are of the most encouraging character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>Had we the requisite funds, we could in a few weeks send forth not less than a <num value="100">hundred</num> such laborers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>Besides, many of the chaplains are being supplied by us with tracts for general distribution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>Thus it will be seen that there is much need of funds, if this most important and interesting work is vigorously prosecuted, and we are solely dependent on the free-will offerings of those who feel interested in such labors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>Our books and tracts, which are such as are approved by all evangelical denominations, are for the most part given away. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/> There is scarcely another such school of vice on the earth as the encampment, and we must counteract its hurtful teachings by the <q>&#x0022;book of books,&#x0022;</q> and by volumes and tracts of kindred influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>The leisure of the soldier, if we can secure it for religious reading, may win him to become as well a soldier of the cross. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/> In no way can we so effectually show our appreciation of those who are now defending all that is worth living or dying for; in no way so well aid the sacred cause of Southern independence, as by surrounding our soldiery with the restraining, sanctifying and <sic>ennnobling</sic> influences of Christianity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>Urged by such convictions, I would most earnestly invite the co- operation of all classes throughout our young <q>&#x0022;nationality&#x0022;</q> in this inviting field of <name>Christian</name> enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>We need funds with which to publish Testaments and defray the expenses of Colporteurs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>Let all who have a mind to help, <hi rend="italics">at once</hi> send on whatever they feel inclined to contribute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>We extract the following readable passages: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/> The <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indians</rs> were scattered in the country back, and few had as yet begun to come in. Yet among these soon appeared the most notable of all present during the day, <q>&#x0022;Standing <placeName reg="Buffalo, Erie, New York" key="tgn,7013463">Buffalo</placeName>, &#x0022;</q> chief of the <name>Sissitons</name>, and in person, demeanor and decorations, a fine specimen of an <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> chieftain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/>A little over <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> in height, straight as <num value="1">one</num> of his arrows, every motion was full of native grace and unabashed dignity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>He was wrapped in a whisp blanket, falling to his feet, with quiver hung by a strip of wolf skin about his chest, a necklace, closely resembling a pair of small grace hoops, about his neck, and a fine <rs n="head dress" type="product">head-dress</rs> of eagle feathers above all. On his breast was pendant a small gilt-framed mirior, said to be his most cherished ornament, and his face, which is mild in expression, was divided into <num value="4">four</num> sections, gay with as many colors, and those banded with others, like an ancient coat-of-arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/>He was speedily introduced to his fellow-dignitary, <persName n="Ramsey,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00453" reg="mostcommon:Ramsey,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Ramsey</surname></persName>, whose fraternal welcome he accepted with the dignity of an equal, if not a superior. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/> The <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indians</rs> seemed not greatly inclined to trading, though fully alive to the value of <q>&#x0022;Koshpoppy&#x0022;</q> money, when possessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/>As they lay in their circles, smoking and talking, they were speedily assailed by the gentlemen with offers for their pipes, which were almost the only thing they had ready to sell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>They are made of red pipe-stone, a material resembling slate in texture, and obtained from a quarry in the region, reserved to them by treaty and guarded with jealous care.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/>Many are cut with singular dexterity, and sometimes beauty &mdash; mostly plain, and resembling a tomahawk in shape, but also of other shapes, sometimes quite elaborate, imitating quite well heads of men and horses, even the whole human form, and often cunningly inlaid in arabesques of lead.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/> About <time value="12oclock">twelve o'clock</time> a <orgName n="Grand Council" type="council">grand council</orgName> was held of the <rs>Governor</rs>, Superintendent and Agent, and the notable men of the <rs n="Dakota" type="nativeamerican">Sioux</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>The <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indians</rs> were addressed by <persName n="Ramsey,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00455" reg="mostcommon:Ramsey,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Ramsey</surname></persName> and the agent, and replied through <q>&#x0022;Red Owl,&#x0022;</q> a dark sinewy man, of intelligent countenance, in which, singularly enough, might be traced no slight resemblance to <persName n="Demosthenes,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00456" reg="mostcommon:Demosthenes,nomatch:0"><surname>Demosthenes</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>His oratory was energetic, his gestures forcible, and at the pauses for interpretation, by which process his speech was emasculated of all its native vigor and eloquence, he was greeted by hearty <q> &#x0022;ughs&#x0022;</q> of approval from his brethren.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>These speeches consisted of the usual excuses and fair promises on our side, and the ordinary complaints from the <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indians</rs>, of injustice and fraud, probably, alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/>too well founded in fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/>There was, to a sympathetic spectator, a touching contrast between the plausible demeanor and language of the white dignitaries, and the simple, untutored earnestness of the savages. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/> After the breaking up of the council, in which a beef had been promised the poor creatures by <persName n="Ramsey,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00457" reg="mostcommon:Ramsey,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Ramsey</surname></persName>; the <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indians</rs> dispersed to kill and dress it, and to prepare for a dance, which they were to give in honor of the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>Their deliberate motions occasioned an interval of a couple of hours, spent by the excursionists in lunching, bartering and watching the numerous groups of aboriginies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="868"/> At nearly <time value="5oclock">five o'clock</time> a large body, looking as <q>&#x0022;terrible as an army with banners, &#x0022;</q> was seen coming down the plain from the direction of the trading houses, preceded by a horrible looking savage, charcoaled and squalid in dress, who circled the ground at a quick paces, howling terribly, to inform us that the show would be there and soon take place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="869"/>As the band grew near, we found it composed of the dancers, perhaps <num value="50">fifty</num> in number, flanked by a cavalcade in escort, on foot and on pony back, and the rear brought up by old men, children and squaws. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="870"/> The dancers, mostly young, quickly ranged themselves around a squatting group of older men, who began beating rude drums, with great energy and in a sort of rhythm adapted to the performance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="871"/>The dance was to be the <q>&#x0022;monkey dance,&#x0022;</q> a new invention, so said, originating in a dream of some young brave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="872"/>The monkey was represented by papoose about as big as <num value="1">one</num>, gayly dressed and held by a good looking squaw.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/>The dancers were dressed in various colored shirts, leather leggins, mostly, and strange, helmet shaped caps, of fur and horse hair, with small horns, and gayly painted and decorated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/>The faces of the men when exposed, and the limbs, were brightly painted, the colors being apparently earthy pigments, coarsely laid on. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/> All being ready, a fellow going rigorously round and round, outside them, brandishing a large hoop, to keep back the crowd, the dance began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/>It consisted of nothing but the rudest hoppings about the circle, sometimes in single line, and sometimes <num value="2">two</num> or more deep, with wild howls and vehement gesticulations and brandishing of the little hoops held in their left hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/>On the whole, if at all interesting, it was still more a pitiable, disgusting spectacle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>This was the great good humor and sense of fun the <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indians</rs> displayed, both among themselves and the whites.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>Their relish for a joke is much more keen than is the case with classes of persons similarly degraded among whites.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>But we were told that in these we were seeing the more mild and civilized portion of these tribes, of whom those we met at the <rs>Upper Agency</rs> are vastly more wild and fierce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/>Certainly these seemed, in general, very simple and docile. </p> </div3>
