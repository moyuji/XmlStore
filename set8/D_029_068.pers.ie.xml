<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> We need scarcely impress upon the farmers the importance of cultivating, with the most energetic industry, every inch of the soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>There is no questioning the food-producing capacity of such a territory as ours to supply our armies and our people, if those at home will devote their whole energies to the task.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>A vast portion of our land, once employed in the production of cotton, tobacco and other exports, is now devoted almost exclusively to the raising of breads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>stuffs, and, notwithstanding the devastation of raids, there will be more than enough, if the cultivators of the soil are diligent and Heaven blesses their labors, to feed themselves and half a dozen such armies as that of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Stephen,D.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>No man should be detained from cultivation by the possibility of raids any more than by the possibility of rust and chinch bugs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>It is the duty of the farmer, in the <num value="1">one</num> case as in the other, to sow his seed and trust to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> to give the increase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Let those who are exempt from the peril and privation of battle struggle to support those who are exposed to both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Whilst the soldiers are fighting against the bayonets of the enemy, let the farmers fight against the starvation tactics, which are the main dependence of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> for our subjugation. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> The practice of refugees abandoning the country and crowding into the large cities is <num value="1">one</num> which would be more honored in the breach than in the observance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>It would be wiser for many who are now in the city to look about for homes in the rural districts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Living is cheaper in the country, and not a few of them may become producers instead of consumers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>If they can get even an humble cabin, and a small garden, and produce a little, if it is only for their own use, it is better than to remain here, where their presence can only add to their own sufferings and those of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>We warn refugees to keep away from <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, and advise those who are here, and can find homes in the country, to select some spot where they can avoid the enormous expense of the necessaries of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Our charitable citizens and relief committees have their liberality exerted to the utmost to provide for many who, if in the rural districts, might not only be more comfortable themselves, but greatly aid the farmers in the cultivation of the soil. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> The soldiers of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> have won the admiration of the world, not less by their splendid valor than their heroic endurance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The world has no such army as that of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>It is not composed of mercenaries, who fight for their monthly pay, and have no interest in the cause which they support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>It is made up of the valor, the pith, the intellect and the soul of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>It is fighting for home, for wife and children, for freedom, for honor, for religion, for all that is dear in memory and precious in hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The young men who compose that army need not be told that their mothers, their sisters, their aged fathers, are looking to them for deliverance from slavery; nor that there is no future for themselves but exile or bondage, if they fail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>We are not surprised to hear that there is no such word as fail in their hearts or their thoughts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>We wish that some of the croakers at home could have heard the cheers of a certain division, lately, as it confronted the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>It was heard for miles; and no band of music that ever played sent forth such blasts of defiance and inspiration. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> Well may the enemy concede at last that it is not the capture of this or that <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> city which will achieve the triumph of their cause, but the overthrow of the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>It is the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> that is the sheet anchor of the great ship in this mighty tempest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>And nobly is it performing its duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>It has learned how to suffer and endure as well as to do and dare. --It indulges no vain threats, but it has calmly and firmly resolved to choose death rather than degradation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>There is not a high-souled patriot in its ranks who would not rather sleep in a hero's grave than live to be a slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>All honor to these heroes &mdash; these hopeful, these glorious men!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Who can doubt that, with the aid of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, they will yet achieve their country's independence and walk the earth as freemen?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>And what a reward will be theirs!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>History and Poetry will embalm their names; their ransomed country will clasp them to her breast as her deliverers; mothers will point them out to their children; old men will rise up to do them honor; women will look at no <num value="1">one</num> else; their example will blaze up like a beacon fire to encourage the oppressed and suffering of every clime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>No patent of nobility will convey such a distinction as the record:--<q>&#x0022;This man was a soldier of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>. &#x0022;</q> </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>The exhibition he made of himself on the <rs>Inauguration Day</rs> was not worthy of the wisest and most virtuous people in the world and the best government under the sun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>And what is meant when, in public, a man utters platitudes, and makes those platitudes personal, and cannot help repeating those personal platitudes a great number of times, as if there were some magnetic attraction in the words &mdash; is very well known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>We do not intend, of course, to intimate that high officials do not often confine themselves to platitudes, even in their most sober and intellectual efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>But we do mean to say that the assertion that, in this country, office-holders &#x0027;d'rive their power from the people&#x0027; is too obvious a truism to require &#x0027;<measure n="2.5minutes" type="date">two minutes and a half</measure> on that point.&#x0027; </p>
