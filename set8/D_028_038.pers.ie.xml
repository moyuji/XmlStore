That paper says that the most remarkable and significant revelation made by <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s march through <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> was not, perhaps, the internal weakness of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>; but the entire absence of <hi rend="italics">desperation</hi> on the part of that portion of the population which remains at home. &#x0022;If,&#x0022; says the <hi rend="italics">Times,</hi> &#x0022;the war were felt by them to be a National war, in the sense in which this phrase is ordinarily understood, a war in which everything that men hold dear was at stake, and in which death was preferable to submission, it is impossible to believe that their resistance to <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s progress would have been so feeble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The proclamations of the leaders, of the <rs>Governor</rs> and <rs>Generals</rs>, of the <rs>Senators</rs> and Congressmen, and the articles in the newspapers, were couched in terms worthy of the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>They were just such as ought to have been issued by revolutionary chiefs to followers who were really and terribly in earnest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>They called on the <name>Georgians</name> to &#x0027;come in squads or come singly,&#x0027; to &#x0027;bring such weapons as they could find,&#x0027; to &#x0027;rise to a man in the invader's path,&#x0027; to &#x0027;bushwhack him without mercy.&#x0027;--The planters were to shoot at him from behind fences; the negroes to be employed in cutting down trees across the road and breaking down bridges; and last, and greatest sacrifice of all, they were to lay waste everything before him, to drive off the cattle and horses, and burn and destroy what they could not convey away. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> &#x0022;Nor were these appeals extravagant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Efforts as heroic as these here called for have been made in various ages by the people, whom the appearance of an invader had wrought up to the highest pitch of patriotic excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Almost in our own day, both the <name>Russians</name> and Tyrolese have opposed just such obstacles to the progress of <name>French</name> armies of invasion, as the <name>Georgians</name> were asked to oppose to that of <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>They either rose <hi rend="italics">en masse</hi> in their front, &#x0027;bushwhacked&#x0027; them along every mile of the road, from behind every rock and tree and fence, or else converted their line of march into a howling waste, and left them no better fruits of victory than desolated fields and charred ruins. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> &#x0022;In <placeName key="tgn,7007248" n="1.000 6" reg="georgia">Georgia</placeName>, on the contrary, it appears well ascertained that the great majority of the inhabitants staid quietly at home, and awaited the invader's approach in respectable quiet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>So far from destroying their property in order to deprive him of the means of subsistence, they did not even drive off their mules, horses or cattle, though this would have been <num value="1">one</num> of the easiest and most obvious modes of damaging him. In fact, it is hard to see that any Georgian farmers, except those who joined the militia, made the smallest personal sacrifice in aid of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, at the most important juncture in its history, and when they were most earnestly and solemnly entreated to make every sacrifice, by the men who are supposed to have, and who ought to have, if the concern were a sound <num value="1">one</num>, their fullest confidence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> &#x0022;There is only <num value="1">one</num> interpretation that can be put on this extraordinary apathy, and that is, that confidence in the success of the rebellion no longer exists anywhere outside of the official class and the army, if it exist there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The Governors of States who write the flaming appeals whenever our raiders make their appearance, are, of course, as members of the oligarchy, closely allied </p> <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> in sentiment, as well as in interest, with the <rs>Confederate</rs> leaders; but it appears, of late, plain that the farmers who have so far escaped the net of the conscription, either have grown tired of the contest or despair of success, and that their great aim now is not to serve the rebellion, but to avoid sharing its fortunes.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> If all that were true,--and we leave it to the fellow-citizens of those heroic <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> troops who have illustrated so many battle-fields to hurl back the accusation,--<persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> has stepped in to supply to all the people of this country a motive of &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">desperation</hi>&#x0022; which cannot fail to arouse the most sluggish and exasperate the most pacific.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>If they have not believed their own orators, their own newspapers, and their own governors, perhaps they will believe him when he tells them that slavery is abolished, and that they can only be allowed to approach his footstool as suppliants suing for mercy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>If, after all this, they fall behind Russians, Tyrolese, and every other invaded nation of ancient and modern times, and look passively on the progress through their country of a conquering army, we shall concede that the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> knows them better than we do, and that provincial vassalage to a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> despotism would be no degradation. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> journals make themselves merry over the seediness of Confederate garments, and the general &#x0022;rebel style of shabbiness.&#x0022; The Confederate wardrobe, it is true, has become somewhat dilapidated by the war, but we should dislike to exchange the hearts that beat beneath it for the purple and fine linen of <persName n="Broadway,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Broadway,nomatch:0"><surname>Broadway</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Ragged as our soldiers are, they are not as badly off in that respect as the coatless and shoeless soldiers of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Revolution, the praises of whose bare feet and tattered garments are to be found in <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> histories of the days of <dateStruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Nor are they in anything like the forlorn condition of the army of <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName> when <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="nearbymention:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> took command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Nevertheless, that army managed to make itself presentable at every court in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and to cut a finer figure in history than kings and nobles. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> There is no such worshipper of externals as your genuine snob and parvenue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>There are people who are eternally vexing the heavens with their fulminations against aristocracy; who profess to be proud of their <rs n="Plebeian" type="socialclass">plebeian</rs> origin, and consecrate the rags of their Revolutionary fathers as sacred emblems of Liberty, sneering in the same breath at the shabbiness of rebel clothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Broadcloth coats and patent-leather boots are more attractive, in their estimation, than the most heroic qualities of the human soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Pride of noble descent is weak enough, but what can be said of pride which depends upon the wool of a sheep and the skin of a calf for its supreme happiness?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>This <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> idolatry of dress is what we might expect from Tittlebat Titmouses and miscegenations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Such a people are only fit for subjects of the despotism that already has its foot upon their abject necks. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/> By the same authority, it is also declared that no general amnesty will again be granted, and those who refuse to accept the pardon now offered, or who shall hereafter desert or absent themselves without leave, shall suffer such punishment as the courts may impose, and no application for clemency will be entertained. </p>
