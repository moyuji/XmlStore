<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>The chief Executive officer of the <rs>State</rs> which, above all others, perhaps, is most jealous of State rights, where they are really in danger, he hesitates not to approve of the decision of the <orgName n="Circuit Court" type="court">Circuit Court</orgName> that neither the &#x0022;Ordnance, nor the act amendatory of sit, contemplated exemption from any service besides militia service, in the <rs>State</rs>, and so neither is in conflict with the conscription laws.&#x0022; But fearful lest some difficulty may still arise upon the interpretation of what ill-disposed persons might choose to represent as conflicting laws, he recommends an amendment of the exemption laws, so as to make them conform, as nearly as possible, to those of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>A most sensible suggestion, and <num value="1">one</num> worthy of the bold soldier who makes it. This is no time for making nice distinctions between the laws of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> and the laws of any State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>We want soldiers to fight, not lawyers to talk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>We want State Governments that will conform their laws to those of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>, not raise opposition to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>We want a system in each State which shall send the greatest number of recruits to the field, not <num value="1">one</num> founded upon the principle of keeping the largest number at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>We wish to see all the <name>States</name> united to aid the <rs>Confederacy</rs> in carrying on the war, not quibbling and word-catching, to impede its operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>The States may do this without yielding a particle of their rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>At least, such is the opinion of <persName n="Bonham,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00079" reg="mostcommon:Bonham,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Bonham</surname></persName>, a State rights man of the straightest sect, brought up at the very feet of the great State-rights <persName><foreName>Gamaliel</foreName></persName> himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>Others who have not enjoyed that privilege, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time in their lives manifest a wonderful tenderness for the rights of and profess to feel unbounded alarm at the encroachments of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>He knows, as every man of sense must know, that our system is based upon a distinct acknowledgment of these rights &mdash; that they are to us what the laws of <persName><foreName>Edward</foreName></persName> the <name>Confessor</name> were to the <rs>English</rs> people in former times &mdash; that they are the point from which all legislation starts &mdash; and that a full acknowledgment of them constitutes every State a distinct nation, with the power to shape her own legislation as she may. All that is now required is, that each State may so legislate as to give the greatest efficiency to the agent which all the <name>States</name> have chosen to carry on in their name this bloody and dangerous war. To that end it is but reasonable that each should amend its laws when they come in conflict with those of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>He says: &#x0022;If the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> will put into the field the most of the able bodied men between <num value="18">eighteen</num> and <num value="45">forty-five</num> now employed as quartermasters and commissaries, purchasing agents, enrolling officers, and impressing agents, and in other similar positions, the great mass of their places can be as well, and in many instances better, filled by disabled soldiers, and the <rs>State Governments</rs> will conform theirs to the <rs>Confederate</rs> exemption acts, the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> can command force that will drive beyond our borders all the armies the <rs>Abolition Government</rs> can congregate for the further prosecution of this unholy war.&#x0022; We have no doubt that this is true to the letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>And will not the <name>Governments</name>, State and Confederate, make the experiment?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>The man in a fight who is always looking over his shoulder to see if somebody is coming to help him, and abusing the by standers because they keep aloof, is not likely to impress the world with any very deep conviction of his conscious strength.
