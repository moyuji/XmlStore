<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>It appears that a report reached <persName n="Evans,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00152" reg="mostcommon:Evans,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Evans</surname></persName> that the <rs>Federals</rs> were crossing the river at <placeName reg="Edwards's Ferry">Edwards's Ferry</placeName> on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, and the <orgName type="regiment" key="13MSRegiment">13th Mississippi regiment</orgName> was sent down from <placeName reg="Leesburg, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2112647">Leesburg</placeName> to keep them in check and under the belief that the heaviest portion of the enemy's forces would cross at that point the <orgName type="regiment" key="MS13">13th Mississippi</orgName> followed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>It turned out however, that another place was chosen by the enemy some <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> higher up the river, where the channel is from <num value="175">175</num> to <measure n="50yards" type="distance">50 yards</measure> in width, and not fordable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>They crossed in flat boats and skiffs, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> engagement was between the <orgName type="regiment" key="8VARegiment">8th Virginia Regiment</orgName> and the advance columns of the foe. The skirmishing continued with considerable severity for some hours, and the <orgName type="regiment" key="MS18">18th Mississippi</orgName> hearing the firing marched in double quick steps to the scene of action, the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 13">13th regiment</orgName> at <placeName reg="Edwards's Ferry">Edwards's Ferry</placeName> to prevent the <unclear></unclear> there and executing a flank movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>The latter alternative was adopted by some who were afterwards captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>The fighting now became terrible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>The contending forces were in close proximity and we are informed that not only sword and bayonets, but even <rs n="bowie knives" type="product">bowie-knives</rs> were used with fearful effect upon the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>The latter finding they were overpowered made an effort to reach their boats, which a large number succeeded in doing; but the rush was so great that several boats were overturned or sunk and the panic-stricken soldiers were drowned in large numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>We have no means of ascertaining how many was on the <rs type="place">Island</rs> in the river but it is not difficult to say how many failed in the attempted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>Those who were left on the shore then put down their arms and surrendered, and this terminated the battle. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/> Just as I was closing my letter last evening I learned that great apprehensions were felt lest an attempt would be made to run the blockade by the <rs>Yorktown</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>The greatest activity was manifest in mounting guns on the ramparts of the fort which would bear upon the channel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>As the sun went down the workmen were busy in putting the guns in order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>I also learned that the <rs>Union</rs> gun, which is now mounted on the point near the light-house, was to be replaced by the <measure n="15inch" type="distance">15-inch</measure> seacoast gun. Believing that some work might be done ere this morning's sun arose, I took my blanket and glass and wended my way up the dry sandy beach until I reached a position where I could discover any movements in their earliest stages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>I had not been in position long before I saw the <term type="ship">tugs</term> <rs type="ship">Young America</rs> and <rs type="ship">Beckwood</rs> come up the bay and take up a position at a convenient distance between <placeName reg="Sewell's Point, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,2653764">Sewell's Point</placeName> and <orgName n="Newport News" type="newspaper">Newport News</orgName> Point, so that they could see any craft if they attempted to come out of <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>, or should by any good management escape the good watch kept on board the <rs type="ship">Congress</rs> or <placeName reg="Cumberland, Allegany, Maryland" key="tgn,2046811">Cumberland</placeName>, and pass down the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>Not long after the tags took their stations the lights were extinguished on board. </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/> The night was beautifully clear, and the stars shone out in all their brightness, while the fresh southwesterly wind drove the miniature waves up in whitened crests on the beach where I lay. In vain I tried to close my eyes for a &#x0022;<num value="40">forty</num>-wink nap,&#x0022; but the rumor which I heard bore so much semblance to truth, and there were so many reasons why we should expect the <name n="Confederate States">rebel</name> steamer down, possibly in a few hours, that it was impossible for me to keep my eyes closed over <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure> at a time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>We have reliable information here that the <rs>Yorktown</rs> is leaking badly, and that she is obliged to keep her pumps going all the time to keep her free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>This fact made the rumor even more probable, and I could not, in common with many others, but observe that we should see her dusky form heave in sight at a moment's warning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>With my glass I scanned the coast line from abreast of <orgName n="Newport News" type="newspaper">Newport News</orgName> Point down to <placeName key="tgn,2265633" n="1.000 8" reg="craney island, portsmouth, virginia">Craney Island</placeName>, and thence to <placeName reg="Sewell's Point, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,2653764">Sewell's Point</placeName>, where a series of telegraphic signals, formed by lights of different colors, were being made to <placeName key="tgn,2265633" n="1.000 8" reg="craney island, portsmouth, virginia">Craney Island</placeName>, and answers returned, by the same process.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>The telegraphing occupied my attention for some time, as I became interested, and felt desirous, if possible, to learn by future movements the readings of the lights. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/> I was not alone in my watching, for hundreds of wakeful and watchful eyes were straining into the shadowy darkness to catch the faintest outline of any object that might bestire itself on the broad expanse of the dark waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>At about <time value="11:30oclock">half-past 11 o'clock</time> I saw the dim outlines of a large object in the direction of <placeName key="tgn,2265633" n="1.000 8" reg="craney island, portsmouth, virginia">Craney Island</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>Could it be the <rs>Yorktown</rs> passed by the point?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>No: there was not enough water to float her there.--Possibly it might be the <rs>Merrimac</rs> coming out from <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>While thus ruminating to myself, I thought of the guard boats, and upon turning to look for them I heard the rattling of a chain cable, and soon saw that the <rs>Young America</rs> was under way steaming slowly towards the point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>They had seen the same object that I had. On she went, while the telegraphing at the point had ceased for some time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>A few moments of breathless anxiety intervened, and I was most sure the little tug was about to bag some game; when, to my surprise and chagrin, up went <num value="2">two</num> red lights at <placeName reg="Sewell's Point, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,2653764">Sewell's Point</placeName>; then <num value="1">one</num> red and <num value="2">two</num> white ones were thrown; and of course the craft had been signalized that there was danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>The little tug was now almost lost in the distance and darkness, and I was expecting to see her <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> fire a blue light and then a gun but no such good fortune awaited me. In the course of an hour the tug returned and anchored, and all was quiet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>I think that the vessel we saw was a flat-boat which had come down in the daytime to the point, and was returning at that time of the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>This seems to be the opinion of those on the tug who saw the object referred to. I fell asleep about <time value="4oclock">four o'clock</time> in the morning and woke up when the sun had made his appearance above the waters of the bay. The market flats were pulling in shore, and the steamer from <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> was entering the bay. I rolled up my blanket and came into the point, having passed a lonely and watchful night.
