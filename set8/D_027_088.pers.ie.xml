The churches remained closed, the sidewalks were crowded with men, women and children hurrying to and fro without any apparent object; the streets were filled with citizens, demoralized officers and soldiers on horseback, carts, drays, wagons, ambulances <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> and carriages, droves of cattle and horses, all flying from the dreaded <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Nor was the scene at the depot more in keeping with the sanctity of the day. Trains of ambulances from the army and hospitals jostled each other in their hurry to reach it; the platform was crowded with goods of every description, civilians and soldiers &mdash; some evidently in full health, others sick or wounded, some on crutches, some on stretchers, some perched on bales or boxes &mdash; all waiting for a train, which no sooner arrived than it was filled with the stores, sick and mutilated men, without surgeons, nurses, or even a supply of water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Nobody appeared to inquire or to care for its destination; it was enough that it was leaving our devoted town. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> The next morning, while the citizens filled with dread and apprehension, were watching and waiting for the approach of the enemy, a rabble of negroes and whites, of both sexes and all ages, surrounded the deserted stores of the commissaries and quartermasters and plundered them of their contents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Here, was a white boy carrying gray caps enough to cover the heads of a company; there, a negro woman staggering under a load of <rs n="cotton yarn" type="product">cotton yarn</rs>; here, white men removing whole bales of cotton cloth to some secret hiding place; there, negroes rolling away barrels of &#x0022;hard tack&#x0022;--all laughing and making merry, doubtless congratulating themselves upon the rich harvest they were reaping.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>But with all their force and industry they could not gather the half of it before they were scattered in all directions by the cry, &#x0022;The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are coming!&#x0022; And, sure enough, solitary horsemen, dressed in the hated blue, came dashing, pistol in hand, through our now deserted streets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>I have been absent nearly a week on a visit to my brother in <placeName reg="Sparta, White, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101606">Sparta</placeName>, who has been quite out of health for some time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Your letter I found here on my return home yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The delay of my reply, thus occasioned, I regret. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> without further explanation or apology, allow me now to say to you that no person living can possibly feel a more ardent desire for an end to be put to this unnatural and merciless war, upon honorable and just terms, than I do. But I really do not see that it is in my power, or yours, or that of any number of persons in our position, to inaugurate any movement that will oven tend to aid in bringing about a result that we, and so many more, so much desire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>The movement by our Legislature at its last session, at the suggestion of the <rs>Executive</rs>, on this subject, was by authority properly constituted for such a purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>That movement, in my judgment, was timely, judicious, and in the right direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Nor has it been without results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The organization of that party at the <rs>North</rs> to which you refer may justly be claimed as a part of the fruits of it.--these, it is to be hoped, will be followed by others of a more marked character, if all in both sections who sincerely desire peace upon correct terms will give that movement, thus inaugurated, all the aid in their power. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> the resolutions of the <orgName n="Georgia Legislature" type="legislature">Georgia Legislature</orgName>, at its last session, upon the subject of peace, in my judgment, embodied and set forth very clearly those principles upon which alone there can be permanent peace between the different sections of this extensive, once happy and prosperous, but now distracted country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>They easy and perfect solution to all our present troubles, and those far more grievous ones which loom up in prospect and portentously threaten in the coming future, is nothing more than the simple recognition of the fundamental principle and truth upon which all <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> constitutional liberty is founded, and upon the maintenance of which alone it can be preserved; that is, the sovereignty &mdash; the ultimate absolute sovereignty &mdash; of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>This doctrine our Legislature announced to the people of the <rs>North</rs> and to the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>It is the only keynote to peace &mdash; permanent, lasting peace &mdash; consistent with the security of public liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>The old confederation was formed upon this principle; the old union was afterwards formed upon this principle; and no union or league can ever be formed or maintained between any States, <name>North</name> or <name>South</name>, securing public liberty, upon any other principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The whole frame-work of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> institutions, which in so short a time had won the admiration of the world, and to which we were indebted for such an unparalleled career of prosperity and happiness, was formed upon this principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>All our present troubles spring from a departure from this principle-- <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> from a violation of this essential vital law of our political organism. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/> in <dateStruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></dateStruct> our ancestors, and the ancestors of those who are waging this unholy crusade against us, together proclaimed the great and eternal truth, for the maintenance of which they jointly pledged their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor, that &#x0022;governments are instituted amongst men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed;&#x0022; and that &#x0022;whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends, (those for which it was formed,) it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute a new government, laying its foundations on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/> it is needless here to State that by &#x0022;people&#x0022; and &#x0022;governed&#x0022; in this annunciation is meant communities and bodies of men capable of organizing and maintaining government, not individual members of society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>The &#x0022;consent of the governed&#x0022; refers to the will of the mass of the community or State in its organized form, and expressed through its legitimate and properly-constituted organs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/> it was upon this principle the <name>Colonies</name> stood justified before the world in effecting a separation from the mother country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>It was upon this principle that the original <num value="13">thirteen</num> co- equal and co-sovereign States formed the federal compact of the old union in <dateStruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>it is upon the same principle that the present co-equal and co-sovereign States of our confederacy formed their new compact of union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>The idea that the old union, or any union between any of their sovereign States, consistently with this fundamental truth, can be maintained by force is preposterous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>This war springs from an attempt to do this preposterous thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Superior power may compel a union of some sort, but it would not be the union of the old Constitution or of our new &mdash; it would be that sort of union that results from despotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>The subjugation of the people of the <rs>South</rs> by the people of the <rs>North</rs> would necessarily involve the destruction of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the overthrow of their liberties as well as ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>The men or party at the <rs>North</rs> to whom you refer, who favor peace, must be brought to a full realization of this truth, in all its bearings, before their efforts will result in much practical good; for any peace growing out of a <orgName n="States Union" type="union">union of States</orgName> established by force will be as ruinous to them as to us. --the action of the <orgName n="Chicago Convention" type="convention">Chicago Convention</orgName>, so far as its platform of principles goes, presents, as I have said on another occasion, &#x0022;a ray of light, which, under <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, may prove the dawn of day to this long and cheerless night.&#x0022; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> ray of light I have seen from the <rs>North</rs> since the war began.--this cheers the heart, and towards it I could almost have exclaimed: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/> <cit><q> <lg type="stanza"> 
<head></head> <l>&#x0022;Hail, holy light, offspring of Heaven <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> born, </l><l>Or of the eternal co-eternal beam, </l><l>May I express thee unblamed?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>since <name n="God" type="God">God</name> is light.&#x0022; </l> </lg> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/> Indeed, I could quite so have exclaimed, but for the sad reflection that whether it shall bring healing in its beams, or be lost in dark and ominous eclipse, ere its good work be done, depends so much upon the action of others who may not regard it and view it as I do. So at best it is but a ray &mdash; small and tremulous ray &mdash; enough only to gladden the heart and quicken hope. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/> The prominent and leading idea of that convention seems to have been a desire to reach a peaceful adjustment of our present difficulties and strife through the medium of a convocation of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>They propose to suspend hostilities to see what can be done, if anything, by negotiation of some sort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>This is <num value="1">one</num> step in the right direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>To such a <orgName n="States Convention" type="convention">convention of the States</orgName> I should have no objection, as a peaceful conference and interchange of views between equal and sovereign Powers &mdash; just as the convention of <dateStruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct> was called and assembled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>The properly-constituted authorities at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, the duly-authorized representatives of the <num value="2">two</num> confederates of States now at war with each other, might give then assent to such a proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>Good might result from it. It would be an appeal on both sides from the sword to reason and justice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>All wars which do not result in the extinction or extermination of <num value="1">one</num> side or the other must be ended, sooner or later, by some sort of negotiation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>From the discussion and interchange of views in such a convention, the history, as well as the true nature of our institutions, and the relation of the <name>States</name>, towards, each other and towards the federative head, would doubtless be much better understood generally than they now are. But I should favor such a proposition only as a peaceful conference, as the convention of <dateStruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct> was. I should be opposed to leaving the questions at issue to the absolute decision of such a body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Delegates might be clothed with powers to consult and agree, if they could, upon some plan of adjustment, to be submitted for subsequent satisfaction by the sovereign States whom it affected before it should be obligatory or binding, and then binding only on such as should so ratify.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>It becomes the people of the <rs>South</rs> as well as the people of the <rs>North</rs> to be quite as watchful and jealous of their rights as their common ancestors were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>The maintenance of liberty in all ages, times, and countries, when and where it has existed, has required not only constant vigilance and jealousy, but has often required the greatest privations and sufferings and sacrifices that people or States are ever subjected to Through such an ordeal we are now passing. --Through a like, and even severer, ordeal our ancestors passed in their struggle for the principles which it has devolved upon us thus to defend and maintain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>But great as our sufferings and sacrifices have been, and are, to which you allude, they are, as yet, far short of the like sufferings and sacrifices which our fathers bore with patience, courage and fortitude in the crisis that tried men's souls&#x0022; in their day. These are the <unclear> </unclear> that sustained them in their hour of need.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>Their illustrious and glorious example bids us not to underestimate the priceless inheritance they achieved for us at such a cost of treasure and blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Great as are the odds we are struggling against, they are not greater than those against which they successfully struggled. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/> In paint of reverses, our condition is not to be <unclear></unclear> with theirs.

At present, however, I do not see, as I stated in the outset, that you, <unclear></unclear> or any number of persons in our position, can do anything towards inaugurating any new movement looking to a peaceful solution of the present strife. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/> The war, on our part, is fairly and entirely defensive in its character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>How long it will continue to be thus wickedly and mercilessly waged against us, depends upon the people of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/><placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, our own State, to whom we owe allegiance, has, with great unanimity, proclaimed the principles upon which a just and permanent peace ought to be sought and obtained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>All you, and I, and others in our position, therefore, can do on that line, at this time, is to sustain the movement thus already inaugurated, and to the utmost of our ability to hold up their principles as the surest hope of restoring soundness to the public mind North, as the brazen serpent was held up for the healing of <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName> in the <rs>Wilderness</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/> The chief aid and encouragement we can give the peace party at the <rs>North</rs> is to keep before them these great fundamental principles and truths, which alone will lead them and us to a permanent and lasting peace, with the possession and enjoyment of constitutional liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>With these principles once recognized, the future would take care of itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>There would be no more war so long as they should be adhered to.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/> The tone of the <rs>President</rs>'s speech at <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName> is decidedly cheerful, and must have the effect of cheering the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>There has been some despondency of late &mdash; causeless, we surely think, and by no means universal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>Yet there has been some.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>Now, <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00066" reg="nearbymention:Davis,W.,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> knows better than any <num value="1">one</num> else the actual condition of the country, its resources, its prospects, and the chances it stands of a successful struggle with the powerful force of our adversary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>If he be cheerful with all the facts before him, why should private persons, who see but a portion of the drama at a time, be despondent?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>We have too much confidence in the <rs>President</rs> as a gentleman and a man of integrity to believe that he would impose a series of false statements and fallacious hopes upon the public under any circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>But, honor and integrity out of the question, what object could he have in withholding the truth?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>If matters be not as he says they are &mdash; if we be <hi rend="italics">in articulo mortis,</hi> instead of a promising condition <unclear>o</unclear> bodily health,--he must know that the truth cannot be long concealed; that when revealed it must act upon him with terrible severity from having suppressed it, and that the consequences must be to him of too serious a character to be compensated by any patent popularity obtained by the sacrifice of his veracity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>We believe he speaks the truth; and, thus believing, we call on the croakers to hold up their heads and shut their mouths.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>It is time enough to give up the ship when the pilot says there is no longer any hope. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/> We have resorted to <num value="1">one</num> method of finding out how we stand when we are beset by croakers, which has always had such a good effect upon our own spirits that we recommend it to others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>We always ask how <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00067" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> looks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>If he be serious, we are apt to think there is trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>If he be cheerful, we dismiss all doubts and fears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>His face is to us, and to <num value="1000">thousands</num> besides, a weather glass, whereon they read the state of the atmosphere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>Now, we learn that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00068" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, naturally of a disposition inclined to sober cheerfulness, never was more cheerful than he is at this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>Let all croakers take comfort from this, for it is given unto them as a sign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>They have no occasion to despair as long as <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00069" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> does not despair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>They have no right to despond while he is in good spirits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>He knows much better what he can do and what he cannot do than anybody else knows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>Upon his broad shoulders lies the full weight of this young Confederacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>As long as he stands up under it, what right has anybody who does not feel the weight of a pound avoirdupois on his own shoulders to give way?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>For our own part, we are determined to give up when <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00070" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> gives up, and not a moment before that time. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>We find that it was not a <hi rend="italics">letter,</hi> but a formal <hi rend="italics">order.</hi>--The <rs type="place">Valley</rs> is to be reduced by fire and sword to the condition of a desert. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/> It is to be regretted that <persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00073" reg="mostcommon:Early,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName> did not order, or rather permit, while it was in his power, the removal of everything from the <rs type="place">Valley</rs> that could have been of service to the army.
