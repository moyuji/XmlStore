<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> The <rs>Secretary</rs>, after summing up these operations adds that, <q>&#x0022;from a survey of the whole, field of operations, it is apparent that, whatever disasters our arms may have suffered at particular points, a great advance has been made since the commencement of the war.&#x0022; </q> The Union forces are represented to be now in the field under able commanders stronger than ever, resolute and eager to be led against the enemy, to crush the rebellion by a vigorous winter campaign; the armies of the <rs>Potomac</rs> and the <rs>West</rs> vicing with each other in dealing the quickest and heaviest blows against the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Under the calls of <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><month>August</month></dateStruct> there are already in the field over <num value="420000">420,000</num> new troops, of which <num value="339000">339,000</num> are volunteers, <num value="332000">332,000</num> of whom have volunteered for <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> of the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> It is stated in the report that a chief hope of those who set the rebellion on foot was for aid and comfort from disloyal sympathizers in the <rs>Northern States</rs>, whose efforts were relied upon the divide and distract the people of the <rs>North</rs>, and that the call for volunteers and a draft of the militia afforded an occasion for these disloyal persons to accomplish their evil purposes by discouraging enlistments and encouraging opposition to the war and the draft of soldiers to carry it on. </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> The probable success of these disloyal practices created considerable anxiety in some of the <name>States</name>, and the <rs>Government</rs> was urged to adopt measures of protection by temporary restraint of those engaged in the hostile acts, and to this end Provost Marshals were appointed in some States upon the nomination of their Governors, to act under the direction of the <rs>State Executive</rs>, and the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> was suspended by order of the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities; but arrests were forbidden unless authorized by the <rs>State Executive</rs> or <rs type="role" reg="Judge Advocate">Judge Advocate</rs>, and where unauthorized arrests occurred, when brought to the notice of the <name>Department</name>, the parties have been immediately discharged. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> The absence of a large number of officers and enlisted soldiers from their posts, is referred to, and it is stated that the pursuit of such persons, and their compulsory return to duty, is a necessary function of the <rs>Provost Marshals</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The pay and bounty allowed by act of Congress to recruits have offered strong temptations to practice fraud upon the <rs>Government</rs> by false returns upon the muster rolls and false charges for subsistence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Diligent efforts are being made for the detection of all such practices, and to bring the guilty parties before a proper military or civil tribunal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The same course is being pursued in respect to fraudulent contractors and disbursing officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The expenditures for enlistments, recruiting, drilling, and subsistence of volunteers, regulars, and militia, amounts to the sum of <measure n="20692282.91dollars" type="currency">$20,692,282.91</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> The <rs>Secretary</rs> dwells at some length upon the change in the status of colored persons, whom he is pleased to term <q>&#x0022;refugees,&#x0022;</q> produced by the continuance of the war and the advance of the <rs>Union</rs> troops into <q>&#x0022;rebel&#x0022;</q> territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>He says the <orgName n="Quartermaster Department" type="department">Quartermaster's Department</orgName>, upon which the charge of such persons is chiefly imposed, has not found itself burdened with their care, but that it has, on the contrary, derived valuable aid from their labor, in the operations of the army on <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName> and upon the <rs>Potomac</rs>, in the fortifications of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and as laborers, teamsters, hostlers, and in landing and shipping of stores, they have been of great service, and the demand for their labor has exceeded the supply available.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>He adds that <q>&#x0022;the power of the rebels rests upon their peculiar system of labor, which keeps laborers on their plantations to support owners who are devoting their time and strength to destroy our armies and destroy our Government.&#x0022;</q>--It is, in his opinion, the duty of those conducting the war to strike down the system and turn against the rebels the productive power that upholds the insurrection, whenever that system is in hostility to the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>He concludes by warmly sanctioning the compensated emancipation proposition of the <rs>President</rs>, and says that proper application of the means at command of the <rs>Government</rs> cannot fail to accomplish the suppression of the rebellion. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/> A gentleman of the highest reputation for talents and foresight, returned to this city some months ago, from a residence of several years in Parts, from which point he had watched with intense care the movements in the political world on both sides of the <rs>Atlantic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>As the result of his observations, he predicted <measure n="6weeks" type="date">six weeks</measure> ago that the <rs>Emperor</rs> of the <rs>French</rs> would in a short time propose to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> to offer the joint mediation of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> and that country, with the view of bringing about an armistice, preparatory to a final settlement of the difficulties between the belligerent parties in the present war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>Thus far he has proved himself to be a true prophet, and a very little time will determine whether he is so throughout.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>Of course it was understood by both himself and those to whom be spoke that recognition was to be the result of mediation. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/> That, for the present generation, an influx of free negroes into the <rs>North</rs> would seriously impair the value of white labor, may be very true, but <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00221" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> is speaking of the permanent results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>The latter country, once the richest island of the world, has become, by successful insurrection, a wilderness; and the former, with the advantages of gradual emancipation, and the presence of white proprietors of estates, is little better.
