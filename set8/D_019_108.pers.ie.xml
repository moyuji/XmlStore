<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/> At this moment, when the cloud of war is darkening over the land, and the ear is strained to catch on every Northern breeze <q>&#x0022;the clash of resounding arms,&#x0022;</q> we solemnly declare that the <rs>South</rs>, oven now, has been in more danger from the artifices and deceit of her enemies, combined with her own credulity, than from their whole <num value="18000000">eighteen millions</num> in arms. --What was the course of things which this war has interrupted, and, we hope, defeated forever?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>It was the gradual and enduring subjugation of the <rs>South</rs> through the arts of peace, and under the semblance of friendship; but none the less certain and dangerous because pacific and unobserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>The open war of subjugation is a child's play, compared to the insidious policy which had already begun to exert its benumbing influence upon the political, social and even physical capacities of the <rs>Southern States</rs>; which had insinuated its virus into sections of slaveholding <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, and was breathing upon every gale that moral miasma whose seeds of death might ultimately have taken root in our genial soil, and which had fixed its serpent gaze upon the fierce eye of the <orgName n="Southern Eagle" type="newspaper">Southern eagle</orgName>, till the proud bird seemed ready to fall into the sleep of death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>What department of human enterprise had it not monopolized and driven off all competition?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>What vein of the <rs>South</rs> had it not fastened on with the appetite of a bloodsucker? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/> We need not speak of the <num value="500000000">five hundred millions</num> of tribute which the cotton fields of the <rs>South</rs> yield the <rs>North</rs>, and of the magnificent commerce and splendid opulence which Northern cities derive from that great Southern staple, whilst the <rs>South</rs> itself has scarcely a city that deserves the name, and her noble harbors are as solitary as the waters of old <placeName key="tgn,2072794" n="1.000 2" reg="tyre, seneca, new york">Tyre</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>But look about you; think of every article of furniture in your houses, and of clothing and ornament upon your person; every agricultural implement, every article of use in every department of business and trade, and every <num value="1">one</num> has been bought of Northern manufacturers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>Yet this has been the very least and smallest of the evils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>Our whole literature has been manufactured for us at the <rs>North</rs>-- not only books, but, what is more influential, journals, weekly journals, pictorial newspapers, sold in our own streets, and finding their way into every Southern family, not <num value="1">one</num> of which had any other tendency than to darken the conscience and corrupt the morals of the community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>We see what Northern society is from the revelations which they have made of themselves in the present excitement; from the perfidy of our professed friends; from the unblushing diabolism of our enemies; from the recommendations of the public press for such devilish deeds of crime and cruelty as were never heard of in the annals of war, <hi rend="italics">whilst scarcely a voice is raised from any so-called conservative press, in condemnation of these recommendations;</hi> from the watchwords <q>&#x0022;beauty and booty,&#x0022;</q> proclaimed in the newspapers and posted in placards upon the walls; and yet, it is from this seething cauldron of moral abominations, this modern <placeName key="tgn,7016893" n="1.000 1" reg="">Sodom</placeName> of the world, that a weekly and daily literature has been sown broadcast over the <rs>South</rs>, which inculcated no reverence for <name n="God" type="God">God</name> nor man, which insidiously assailed the foundations of virtue, which clothed vice in enticing colors, and was well calculated to allure the unreflecting young men of our cities to undervalue the high moral tone of their Southern homes, and become materialistic, sensual, unprincipled, infidel. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/> The open abolition journals of the <rs>North</rs>, compared with these literary weeklies and other productions of the <rs>Northern</rs> press, are but the ruffian who attacks you openly with a bludgeon at mid-day to the poisoner who puts in your very bread the means of your destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>When, therefore, the <rs>North</rs> threatens us with a war of subjugation, we reply that it is a war which has been waged upon us for years with weapons far more dangerous than any now in its hands, and that in changing the policy of that war from the traitor's kiss to his drawn sword, it has committed a blunder which it will <num value="1">one</num> day deplore more than all its crimes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/> In any aspect of the case, the open war of subjugation is a Blunder, such as no shrewd practical people ever committed before since the world was made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>They had us bound so fast in the meshes of their trade that we could not stir hand or foot; we sat with open mouths and folded hands; whilst our golden soil (which they new say is worth expending <measure n="500000000dollars" type="currency">$500,000,000</measure> a year to keep,) was made their tributary in every way and shape, leaving us nothing for our own share but bread and meat, plain houses, small towns, and silent harbors; they stuck like lamprey eels to every vein of the <rs>South</rs> that had a drop of blood in it; they even induced us to spend in Northern summer visits what few dollars were left after paying our enormous annual toll to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> tax gatherer; and now, suddenly, in a fit of crazy rage, they determine to throw away all the immense conquests they had made in their pacific means of subjugation, to cut open the goose that laid the golden egg, and to make us bitter and implacable enemies as long as we live; or, if we die, to deprive themselves of their best customers, give up the fertile <rs>South</rs> to sterility and solitude, and leave nobody, from the <rs>Potomac</rs> to the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs>, whom they can possibly cajole, cheat and plunder any more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>Could they triumph, as they propose; could they exterminate us, as they threaten; could they abolish our domestic institutions, as they desire, what would <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Doodle do for customers and cotton, for commissions, brokerages, insurances, freights, and the interminable list of its levies upon the <rs>Southern</rs> pocket?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>And the people who have made this grand mistake, who have placed their all upon the hazard of this die, who have thrown themselves between <persName n="Scylla,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00147" reg="mostcommon:Scylla,nomatch:0"><surname>Scylla</surname></persName> and <placeName key="tgn,2233588" n="1.000 10" reg="Charybdis, Fresno, California">Charybdis</placeName>, are the cool, calculating, money making <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>What a strange compound of the practical and the fanatical, of shrewdness and sentimentalism, of a cold heart and a hot head, of common sense and uncommon folly, Is that greatest curiosity of the human family, the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs>!
