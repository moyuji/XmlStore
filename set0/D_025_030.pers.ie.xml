<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> So we are to have an Empire and are to have an Emperor living and being in <placeName reg="North America" key="tgn,1000001">North America</placeName> and event forbidden long ago by the &#x0022;greatest nation in all creation,&#x0022; and interdicted by both the &#x0022;Eagle&#x0022; and the &#x0022;Stars and Stripes!&#x0022; Were the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation free from the war which now absorbs all their means and exercises all their ingenuity, they would beyond doubt essay to defeat the <rs>Empire</rs> and the <rs>Emperor</rs>; but the moment of their close occupation in our subjugation is selected by the <rs>French Emperor</rs> as the most fitting for the introduction of his policy &mdash; Napoleonic ideas &mdash; into <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>They will be indignant at the event, and may well discern in it that which is most unfavorable to their barring and domineering over this continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>They will profess to be horrified at the imperial character of the new Government, while they are themselves the slaves of the vilest and most degraded tyranny that ever cursed the earth. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> The South is content, nay, pleased, with the change of affairs in <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> &mdash; with the prospect of order and security in that country, and its control, at least during pupilage, by a Power altogether friendly to us. Under it the industry of the nation will improve and the tide of commerce and of power in the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> be immensely swelled in volume.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>This will be beneficial to the <rs>South</rs> and, of course, detrimental to the <rs>North</rs>, which must the more certainly cease to be the point of settlement for the continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>It will no longer ship everything, import everything, buy everything, sell everything, and have all the money in its own hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>To maintain this position it is now fighting and expending all its means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>It would freely sell out and spend every dollar it is worth to-day to accomplish this and think it had made a grand speculation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>But secession has deprived them of it, and the elevation of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> in the scale of nations will help still further to keep them forever from recovering it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> With a strong and steady Government, and security to person and property, <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> will become a great producing country &mdash; her productions, too, being of that character most important to commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>It is a most remarkable country, covering an era of eight hundred and twenty nine thousand nine hundred and sixteen <name>English</name> square miles, being <num value="1">one</num> <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> as large as <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Traversed through its whole length by the immense mountain range of the <name>Cordilleras</name>, it embraces within its limits every degree of temperature from the torried to the frigid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The sea coast to an interior elevation of <measure n="2000feet" type="distance">two thousand feet</measure> above the sea is the <foreign lang="spa"><hi rend="italics">tierras calientes</hi></foreign> or hot region, with a mean temperature of <num value="77">77</num> degrees.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> A country with so diversified a temperature and soil as <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> will produce everything known to the agriculturist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Her productions, however, may be considered chiefly cotton, coffee, tobacco, indigo, flax, hemp, vanilla, jalap, and cochineal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Sugar might also be produced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Dye-woods, mahogany, and other products of the forests, are very valuable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Of these productions <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> has exported considerably; but owing to the disturbed condition of the country no fair estimate of its capacity can be formed from its statistics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>It is beyond doubt <num value="1">one</num> of the most fruitful countries on the globe. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> The chief source of wealth of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> to this time has been its mines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The silver mines, said to be over <num value="40">forty</num> in number, yield and average of near <measure n="40000000dollars" type="currency">$40,000,000</measure> per annum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Gold is also found in considerable quantity.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> has done something in the way of manufacturing &mdash; having <num value="72">72</num> cotton factories, <num value="6">6</num> woolen factories, <num value="8">8</num> paper mills, <num value="4">4</num> glass factories, &#x0026;c. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> The population numbers <num value="7661520">7,661,520</num>, only <num value="1000000">one million</num> of which is pure white.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> will be made to deplore the day when their folly and malignity combined brought about the events which placed <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> in the hands of an <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> power, and thus lost to themselves the opportunity and the means of controlling that country and its commerce to their own advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Had they respected the rights of the <rs>South</rs>, and been true to the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Constitution, it is hardly probable that <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> would have found a ruler in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Since they have broken up the <rs>Union</rs>, it is all the better for the <rs>South</rs> that <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> is placed beyond their grasp, and is under the direction of a power whose character and interests assures us of peace, security, and friendship on our Southern border, Therefore the <rs>South</rs> may well exclaim, &#x0022;Long live the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> Empire!&#x0022; </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> The <orgName n="Petersburg Express" type="newspaper">Petersburg <hi rend="italics">Express</hi></orgName> suggests that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> will be placed in a quandary with reference to the question of recognizing the new empire of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The Federal Minister, <persName n="Corwin,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Corwin,nomatch:0"><surname>Corwin</surname></persName>, is in the city of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, a spectator of the scene of revolution so painful to his Government, but has not dared to say a word against it. Nor will he. Yet the matter of recognizing the new Government, and opening relations with it, cannot be gotten rid of What <persName><foreName>Jonathan</foreName></persName> will do is a matter of curiosity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> There is another question of some interest, and it is this: The renowned <rs>Corwin</rs>, who went to <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> just after the present war begun, bamboozled the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexicans</rs> into a treaty giving to <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> the privilege to send his troops across their territory to attack our Southern border.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Will the new Government be expected to respect that treaty!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>If there is any such expectation, we have not a doubt that it will be disappointed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> But speculation about what <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> will do in all such matters is only agreeable to those who speculate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> will just accommodate themselves to circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>They will submit to what they can't prevent &mdash; pay damages &mdash; pocket insults &mdash; acquiesce in revolutions detrimental to them &mdash; do anything and everything that they may think expedient, and avoid everything to them inexpedient, while they wage their war of malignity and subjugation against the <rs>South</rs>. </p> </div3> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/> If we could put any faith whatever in the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> press, or think there was anything real in <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> threats, we would look forward with some reasonable expectation that <persName><foreName>Jonathan</foreName></persName> and <persName n="Bull,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="default:Bull,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Bull</surname></persName> would soon fall to blows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>But there is nothing farther from probability while the present war lasts.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/> The garrison at <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName>, it is said, had recourse to rats as a part of their diet in the last period of the siege.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Rats and mules afforded the only variety in the closing entertainments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>The mule meat is said to have been fine, and by a lively effort of the imagination has been likened to venison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>The rats, also, were good, except that like the garrison, they had been put upon quarter rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>We thus see that all creatures, even rats, have their uses in the creation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>The mule is valuable in its life, and, except its long ears and its intolerable obstinacy, would be a universal favorite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>It has little chivalry, and, as a general thing is opposed to war; but it is highly practical in its character, and deserves the respect of all utilitarians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>An animal which can do so much work in its life, and be good to eat besides, may be pardoned its long ears and inflexible opinions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>But we cannot say as much for the rats. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/> Nevertheless the rats, like the mules, have their uses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>They have often been the food of distressed heroes, they have protracted sieges, and thus decided the fate of battles and perhaps of empires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>In this way, if in no other, they make some compensation for the wanton riotousness of their lives; for their reckless raids into our larders and pantries, and their noisy cavalry charges at <time value="12am">midnight</time>, when honest humanity is seeking repose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>These reflections console us when we look upon the large number of well fed and frisky rats gamboling about in great sportiveness and content in the public treasury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>It is there we may not divine the uses of these animals; we may not understand how it is that whole tribes of them are quartered upon the national exchequer like so many maggots in an old chess, but by and by this mystery will be explained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>At present, whilst even mules are hard at work, and the war horses are shouting ha!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>ha! amid the thunders of the battle, and men are pouring out libations of heart's blood upon the altar of liberty, and the rank and file are sleeping on the ground and drawing no rations, these plump and well-conditioned gourmands are <unclear></unclear> <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> in the very heart of the old cheese, and bid fair to leave little of it but the shell.
