<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> When the last of the <q>&#x0022;Union pickets.&#x0022;</q> had come forward, and found such a disparity in the numbers of captors and captives, for a moment he seemed to hesitate whether to yield or not. Instantly the click of <num value="2">two</num> musket cocks was heard, and <num value="2">two</num> muzzles pointing directly at the doubting and wavering captive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>It is needless to add, that no <num value="1">one</num> deposited his arms on the heap quicker than he. In a few moments thereafter these <num value="4">four</num> intrepid Confederate <q>&#x0022;rebels&#x0022;</q> marched into the camp of the <num value="27" type="ordinal">27th</num> <hi rend="italics"><num value="13">thirteen</num></hi> captured <q>&#x0022;Union pickets,&#x0022;</q> and handed them over to be sent to the rear. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> This has been an eventful day with the <orgName n="Army of Virginia" type="army">army of Virginia</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>It had been known since yesterday morning that the rebels were in force immediately in our front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>At that hour the rebels opened their artillery upon <persName n="Crawford,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00050" reg="mostcommon:Crawford,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Crawford</surname></persName> from the wood to the right of the road about <measure n="1mile" type="distance">one mile</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Their long line of cavalry had moved around a high hill on our left towards the <rs type="place">Rapidan ford</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>At once a strong force of cavalry was thrown in that direction, and soon after the enemy, finding he could do nothing counter marched his cavalry to our right.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/> During all this time the firing on both sides was terrific, and the men were falling by the score.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>The line advanced steadily, with the exception of the <orgName type="regiment" key="WI3">3d Wisconsin</orgName>, under a galling fire, and drove the rebels back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>They had hardly returned to their position, however, before they broke and ran again &mdash; in fact, proved worse than useless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>The remainder of the infantry charged upon the enemy's batteries, several of which could not be seen until they entered the wood, where they came suddenly upon a large infantry force that had lain concealed from the commencement of the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>This force opened fire upon our men with frightful effect.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/> The rebels, most certainly have nothing to beast of in this engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> our pickets were driven across and beyond the river, and on the same day the rebel column passed over, and took up a strong position some <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> to the north, on the slope of a wooded mountain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>Nothing, <num value="1">one</num> would imagine, could be clearer than that they intended to give battle, and nothing could be less likely than that they would throw a feeble force on a position strong in itself, but, if inadequately defended, hazardous in the extreme to their whole army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>And yet it seems that <persName n="Pope,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00086" reg="nearbymention:Pope,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Pope</surname></persName> sent forward less than <num value="1">one</num>-quarter of the forces under his immediate command and ready to his hand to give them battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>If the rebels could quickly throw <num value="20000">20,000</num> men from <placeName key="tgn,2111971" n="1.000 34" reg="gordonsville, orange, virginia">Gordonsville</placeName> to the <rs>Rapidan</rs>, and from thence forward to <placeName reg="Cedar Mountain, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2229381">Cedar Mountain</placeName>, while we were forewarned both of their purpose and movement, it was surely possible for <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00092" reg="nearbymention:Pope,Gen,,,"><surname>Pope</surname></persName> to throw forward to meet them at least with <num value="0.5">a half</num> of the twice <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> men under his command, which has been represented as so located that the different columns could be easily concentrated at the shortest notice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/> We suppose that reasons for the failure to do this will be as plenty as they have been for the <num value="100">hundred</num> previous mishaps of the same kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>But it will require more convincing arguments in this case than on previous occasions; for the facts as recited, taken in connexion with previous statements, make it appear the most unaccountable failure we have yet known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>And the fact will stand, that while <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00093" reg="nearbymention:Pope,Gen,,,"><surname>Pope</surname></persName> had a force twice as great as that credited to the rebels, he brought on an engagement with them with a force not half as large as theirs, and less than <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of that of his command. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/> As already said, we have had this kind of strategy too often already.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>We thought that under the new military <hi rend="italics">regime</hi> we had got quite through with it &mdash; that we were to hear of no more surprises; no battles voluntarily begun by us in which the rebels had <num value="2">two</num> to our <num value="1">one</num>; and that no more apologies were to be needed.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/> On <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> last, the long desired order to move in the direction of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00129" reg="nearbymention:Pope,Gen,,,"><surname>Pope</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> came and was hailed with pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>We bivouacked that night near quite a nest of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, who next morning at an early hour, <q>&#x0022;skedaddled&#x0022;</q> in the most approved fashion, illustrating beautifully <persName n="Pope,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00130" reg="nearbymention:Pope,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Pope</surname></persName>'s complacent and grandiloquent remark that there must be no more falling back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>All along our route <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>, we had evidences of their hasty retreat.--They were, however, not fast enough to prevent our cavalry from making a brilliant skirmish, killing <num value="8">eight</num> and capturing <num value="15">fifteen</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>Among the latter were <num value="3">three</num> commissioned officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>The killing was mostly done by sabres, and several <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>' heads were cleft wide open.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>Our loss was none.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>All along our route, <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00131" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> and his army met the most cordial welcome from the people, who roused anew our indignation by thrilling details of the insults, cruelties, and injustice to which they had been subjected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>At <time value="12pm">noon</time> of <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>, we (<hi rend="italics">i. e,</hi> <orgName n="division"><persName n="Ewell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00132" reg="mostcommon:Ewell,nomatch:0"><surname>Ewell</surname></persName>'s division</orgName>, which was, as usual, in the advance,) halted, near <placeName reg="Crooked Run Church">Crooked Run Church</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>This was almost a necessity, as our men were largely broken down by their forced march in the burning sun. The next morning, the enemy being reported as advancing, we moved forward on the main road from <placeName reg="Orange, Orange, Virginia" key="tgn,7014299">Orange Court-House</placeName> to <placeName reg="Culpeper Court-House">Culpeper Court-House</placeName>, about <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure>, and took position, our left flank resting on the <rs type="place">Southwest Mountain</rs>, and our artillery occupying several commanding positions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>At <time value="12mid">12 M.</time>, we commenced our cannonading, which was feebly responded to by the enemy, who did not seem ready for the engagement, which they had affected to challenge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>Indeed, some strategy seemed necessary to bring them to fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>About <time value="3pm">3 P. M.</time> <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00133" reg="nearbymention:Early,S.,H.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> (<orgName n="division"><persName n="Ewell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00134" reg="mostcommon:Ewell,nomatch:0"><surname>Ewell</surname></persName>'s division</orgName>) made a circuit through the woods, attacking the enemy on their right flank, the <orgName type="regiment" key="13VARegiment">13th Virginia regiment</orgName> being in the advance as skirmishers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>At <time value="4oclock">4 o'clock</time> the firing began, and soon the fight became general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>As <orgName n="division"><persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00135" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>'s division</orgName>, then commanded by <persName n="Winder,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00136" reg="nearbymention:Winder,Charles,Sidney,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Winder</surname></persName>, were rapidly proceeding to the scene of action, the enemy, guided by the dust made by the artillery, shelled the road with great precision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>It was by this shelling that the brave <rs>Winder</rs> was killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>His left arm shattered, and his side also wounded, he survived but an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>At a still later period a portion of <persName n="Hill,General,A.,P.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00137" reg="default:Hill,A.,P.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName>'s <orgName n="division">division</orgName> were engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>The battle was mainly fought in a large field near <placeName><persName n="Crittenden,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00138" reg="mostcommon:Crittenden,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Crittenden</surname></persName>'s house</placeName>, a portion being open, and the side occupied by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> being covered with luxuriant corn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>Through this corn, when our forces were considerably scattered, <num value="2">two</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> cavalry regiments made a desperate charge, evidently expecting utterly to disorganize our lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>The result was precisely the reverse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>Our men rallied, ceased to fire on the infantry, and, concentrating their attention on the cavalry, poured into their ranks a fire which emptied many a saddle, and caused the foe to wheel and retire, which, however, they effected without breaking their columns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>For some time the tide of victory ebbed and flowed, but about dark the foe finally broke and retreated in confusion to the woods, leaving their dead and many of their wounded, a gun, caisson, and a large quantity of ammunition upon the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>Daylight faded, and the moon in her full glory appeared, just as the terrors of the raging battle gave way to the sickening scenes of a field where a victory has been won. A few hours later, we opened upon the woods, into which the enemy had fled, and shelled them for some time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>The casualties on our side I will not attempt to detail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>You have doubtless already announced the fate of such as <persName n="Winder,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00139" reg="nearbymention:Winder,Charles,Sidney,,"><surname>Winder</surname></persName>, <persName n="Cunningham,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00140" reg="mostcommon:Cunningham,nomatch:0"><surname>Cunningham</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Morgan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00141" reg="mostcommon:Morgan,G.,W.,,:1"><surname>Morgan</surname></persName>, and you will doubtless be furnished by competent authority with the killed and wounded in different regiments, &#x0026;c. Our total loss was about <measure n="125" type="killed">125 killed</measure>, and <measure n="500" type="wounded">500 wounded</measure>, including many who were slightly injured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>The enemy's loss was admitted by themselves to be far heavier, and was believed by competent judges on our side to be treble or quadruple our own. The enemy's troops engaged were principally the same that we met at <placeName reg="Front Royal, Warren, Virginia" key="tgn,2111870">Front Royal</placeName>, <placeName reg="Cross Keys, Rockingham, Virginia" key="tgn,2268788">Cross Keys</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Port Republic, Rockingham, Virginia" key="tgn,2113715">Port Republic</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>We also took about <measure n="500" type="prisoners">500 prisoners</measure>, including a General and many officers of rank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>The faces of some of these suffered considerable elongation at hearing the fate to which <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00142" reg="nearbymention:Pope,Gen,,,"><surname>Pope</surname></persName>'s infamous order had consigned them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>The enemy were not expecting this onslaught of old <persName n="Jack,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00143" reg="mostcommon:Jack,nomatch:0"><surname>Jack</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>On the contrary, they counted on at least a month of security in which to fatten on their infamous spoils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>They were surprised, and, though not routed, received a defeat and a severe blow. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/> On Sabbath there was no renewal of the engagement, save some slight cannonading on our side, and our troops, occupying their advanced positions, gained the day before, awaited the expected attack of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/><dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> the enemy retrace, which being granted, they came in large numbers, and were employed till night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>It may be that they did not use all possible expedition, desiring delay in order to bring up reinforcements and otherwise prepare for battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>If this was so, they gained nothing, for <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00144" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, having determined not to hazard a battle with the vastly superior forces the enemy would have, also occupied the time to purpose, sending backward all his trains and his rear troops; and at nightfall <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Early,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00145" reg="nearbymention:Early,S.,H.,,"><surname>Early</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>, which was the outpost, quietly followed them, hugging closely the mountain till well out of danger of attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>Never was a retreat effected with better order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>Strategically, it ranked with the masterly march and unexpected attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>Our troops marched all night and half the next day, not stopping till they had gained their original positions, which are very desirable ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>We are now expecting another battle, though whether we will again rush on the enemy, or wait for his advance, I don't pretend to predict. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/> While the enemy were burying their dead, I spent some time with them, and only wish I had time and you room for a detailed account of the conversation had. Perhaps I will give this in a subsequent communication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>I had the opportunity of seeing <persName n="Milroy,,Gen,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00146" reg="default:Milroy,Gen,,,"><foreName>Gen</foreName> <surname>Milroy</surname></persName>.
