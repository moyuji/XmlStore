<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> We wonder how the old man, now tottering on the confines of the grave, feels as he thinks of the part he has played in this terrible tragedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>We <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> know that he advised <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, before giving him his plan for the prosecution of the war, to say to the <rs>Seceding States</rs>, &#x0022;Wayward sisters, depart in peace&#x0022;; and, yet, knowing that this was the course which wisdom and humanity alike dictated, he lent his powerful aid to a course opposed to his own sense of policy and of the true interests of the country, and shaped out the way and manner of striking down to the dust the land that had given him birth, that had nourished and cherished him, and delighted to heap honors upon his head.--It must be a dismal sight, even to his eyes, to see the mother that bore him bleeding at every pore from wounds which his hand has inflicted &mdash; to behold such a people as he knows the people of the <rs>South</rs> to be, trampled into the earth by the hoofs of his hirelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>But she will survive him and his schemes for her destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The whole population in <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>, of whites and free colored persons, was <num value="19987573">19,987,573</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>From an interesting treatise, published by a foreigner in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, the remarkable fact appears to be demonstrated, that, excluding immigration, the population of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, in <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>, would have been <num value="7555423">7,555,423</num>, instead of <num value="19987573">19,987,573</num>--a difference in population of <num value="12432150">12,432,150</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Extraordinary as this may appear, the author seems to have proved it by figures and facts which cannot readily be answered, and which show to our minds that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> is no longer, and was not even as long ago as <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>, an <hi rend="italics"><rs n="American" type="group">American</rs></hi> country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> Another writer, of opposite political views, testifies to the wonderful increase of the foreign element in the <rs>Northern States</rs> since <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>For a single year, <dateStruct value="1853--"><year reg="1853">1853</year></dateStruct>, the aggregate immigration of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, by land and sea, was not short of half a <num value="1000000">million</num> of souls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>At that rate, there arrived in this country every year a sufficient number of persons to make a State embracing as large a white population as <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> or <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, and, within a fraction, enough to make <num value="1">one</num> having as large a white population as <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> or <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Every <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>, there would be enough to balance the white population of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Every <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>, there would be almost enough to offset <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> or <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Every <measure n="5weeks" type="date">five weeks</measure>, a sufficient number to act as a counterpoise to the entire white population of <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Or, at the same rate, making no allowance for the increase of immigration, though, in point of fact, it has progressively and rapidly increased every year, the foreign immigration in <measure n="13years" type="date">thirteen years</measure> (<dateStruct value="1866--"><year reg="1866">1866</year></dateStruct>) would be (we have no doubt it is at this moment) equal to the entire white population of the slave States! </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>For this, the people were plundered; for this, the mills were burned, as well as canals and railroads cut. They also expressed their astonishment at the amount of provisions they found in some parts of the interior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>They had been told, they said, that we were in a state of starvation, but they found an abundance that they had not dreamed of. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/><placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, they have discovered, is not the back bone of the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>It is that army; that host of war-worn veterans who, for <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>, have confronted them with invincible courage, and whom they have given up all hopes of conquering except by starvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>It is for the people to say whether this attempt shall succeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> We pass over the want of dignity in holding unnecessary intercourse with men who are plundering our houses, burning our mills, destroying our provisions, and seeking to reduce us to starvation.
