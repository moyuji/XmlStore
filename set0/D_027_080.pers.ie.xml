<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/> I was compelled to surrender <placeName reg="Fort Gaines, Clay, Georgia" key="tgn,2022920">Fort Gaines</placeName> through feelings of mercy for my officers and men, who earnestly appealed to me. The position was utterly untenable, the fleet having passed and an overwhelming force besieging by land, the only <num value="3">three</num> guns with which I could have responded to the fleet disabled, my picked line driven back to the last notch, the ditches and <unclear></unclear> swept from every direction by the <unclear></unclear> <unclear></unclear> shell, no safe shelter in the miserable apology for a fortification, <measure n="2" type="sick">two sick</measure> men having been killed in what was considered the best casemate, threatened with a tremendous conflagration from the buildings within, and the magazine in great danger of being blown up, and all hope of escapes, or of accomplishing the slightest good by holding out, gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>I did not consider <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName> in danger, for the enemy had evidently not come prepared for anything except to gain the harbor for safe anchorage and as a preliminary step towards further operations in the fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>Under these circumstances, my command was seized with the appalling conviction that our case was hopeless, and seemed paralyzed with the prospect of certain and useless destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/> In your issue of yesterday you have some very sensible remarks about our cavalry; and in your paper of to-day, &#x0022;Broadsword&#x0022; has given you his views as to the cause of the inefficiency of this arm of our service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>New, without meaning to attempt even to controvert, or to discuss, the merits either of your remarks or of the views of &#x0022;Broadsword,&#x0022; I would respectfully beg to be allowed to refer to <num value="1">one</num> other cause of this inefficiency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>As you may be aware, the horses are <hi rend="italics">owned</hi> by the men; and when a man loses his horse, unless able to get another, he is placed in the infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>Now, in these times, when &#x0022;horse flesh&#x0022; is so high and the pay and emoluments of the privates so low, it is almost impossible for a man to supply himself <hi rend="italics">again,</hi> after having once perhaps spent his last cent in the purchase of his horse, It is true, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> will pay the mighty sum of <hi rend="italics"><num value="200">two hundred</num> dollars</hi> for a horse <hi rend="italics">actually killed in battle;</hi> but that sum will barely pay for the &#x0022;red tape&#x0022; with which his papers must be enveloped before he can even hope to get the account through the various offices through which it must pass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>Seeing that the capture or other loss of the horse must be a dead loss to him, of course the man is going to do all in his power to save his horse; and may this not account <hi rend="italics">in some measure</hi> for the time which some of them make in trying to fice the presence of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>The true method, it would seem to me, would be for the <rs>Government</rs> to own the horses, or at least pay the full value for <num value="1">one</num> lost (by capture or otherwise), so that the men would know the loss would fall where perhaps it could be better borne than by themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>The gallant &#x0022;resistance&#x0022; there spoken of, consisted in fighting <num value="1">one</num> battle against a force not so large as that which <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00237" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> now has before <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>The conquest was the most absolute, the submission the most abject, the terms the most degrading, the law imposed the hardest and most remorseless, of which we have any account in modern history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>The conquerors imposed their own laws, substituted their own language in all legal proceedings, took every foot of land from the conquered and divided it among themselves, substituted their own tenures, and completely abolished those of the <name>Saxons</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>A large proportion of the peasantry were reduced to actual slavery, under the name of <hi rend="italics">villeins,</hi> and the whole body were made subject to the will each of a separate lord.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>In a word, the boasted <rs n="Anglo-Saxon" type="group">Anglo-Saxons</rs> became the most abject slaves in all <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and that, too, under foreign taskmasters, who regarded them as a race infinitely inferior to themselves, and treated them far worse than any Southern master ever thought of treating his slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>It is Sallust, we believe, who tells us that the <rs n="Athenian" type="ethnic">Athenians</rs> were the most fortunate race of antiquity, inasmuch as they were for many ages the only historians, and took the liberty of writing their chronicles pretty much to suit the tastes of their own people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>The field, then, was left open to chroniclers and antiquaries, who made out such a story as they pleased; and it pleased them to say that the accession of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> to the conqueror was an &#x0022;acquisition,&#x0022; not a &#x0022;conquest.&#x0022; &#x0022;<foreign lang="spa"><hi rend="italics">Acquisitio, non-conquisitio,</hi></foreign>&#x0022; so it is called by <persName n="Blackstone,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00241" reg="mostcommon:Blackstone,nomatch:0"><surname>Blackstone</surname></persName>, who wrote very little more than a century ago.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>The <rs>Normans</rs> were masters.
