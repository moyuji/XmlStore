<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> --The advantage gained by the enemy at <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName> is <num value="1">one</num> which, to a chivalric adversary, would afford little ground of exultation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>His tremendous odds in artillery, <num value="400">four hundred</num> guns to <num value="13">thirteen</num>, made the result inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>It was a victory which reflected no glory on the successful, and no disgrace on the vanquished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>But whilst it has been attended thus far with no practical advantage to the enemy, it ought to admonish us of the necessity of proper preparation for the war of artillery which <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> relies upon as the only means of meeting the <rs>South</rs> both by land and sea. We have no fear of his artillery in a field battle, for every such action in which we have been engaged attests beyond dispute the superior capacity and aptitude of Southern artillerists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>But the <orgName n="Naval Battery" type="battery">naval batteries</orgName> of the <name>Federalists</name> have been handled both at <placeName key="tgn,3000601" n="1.000 10" reg="cape hatteras, dare, north carolina">Hatteras</placeName> and <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName> with the proverbial accuracy and skill of that branch of the service, and should warn us to make effectual preparations for visitation at every point upon our coasts and rivers where we may expect an attack from ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>We confess ourselves surprised at the indifferent results which have hitherto followed the engagements of land batteries and ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>We had been led to suppose, from the experience of the last war with <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, of the great <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> war half a century ago, and from the more recent conflicts of ships and batteries in the <rs>Russian</rs> war, that land batteries, properly constructed, were more than a match for ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>In at least <num value="75">seventy-five</num> out of every <num value="100">hundred</num> engagements of the last century, the conflicts between shore and <orgName n="Naval Battery" type="battery">naval batteries</orgName> have resulted in the success of the former.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>In the <rs>Russian</rs> war, a small land battery of <num value="4">four</num> guns, with furnaces for heating shot, silenced a British steam frigate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>It is demonstrable that batteries can be so constructed as to be invulnerable by ships of-war, and they can be so sheltered by bomb proofs as to render the men secure from the shells of an enemy. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>It is a fact that mothers have given their sons and wives their husbands to this war as generously and as freely as they ever gave a cup of cold water to the fevered lips of the sick, and that they have given them without expectation or desire of reward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Such men deserve at least the most considerate and courteous treatment from their official superiors, and when sick or wounded the most gentle and humane attentions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>We regret to hear that this is not always the case; that, in some instances, officers assume to treat their men as if they, were mere hirelings of the old regular army; that there are surgeons and nurses who neglect their duty, and are even brutal and cruel to the sick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/> Whether to superior generalship, or discipline, or pluck, or to greater patriotism or enthusiasm, or to whatever else it may be attributed, there can be no doubt of the fact that hitherto the balance of success has been with the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>This is not the place to discuss the why or the wherefore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>Viewing the war and its consequences from a commercial point of sight, the fact alone attracts our attention; and we cannot but regard it as <num value="1">one</num> of immense importance, removing, as we think it does, the prospect of peace from the proximate to the distant future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Were it otherwise, were the balance of success ever so little in favor of the <rs>North</rs>, we might, perhaps, have hoped that the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, conscious of its strength to crush the <rs>South</rs>, but at the same time admonished of its inability to retain military possession of it for any lengthened period, would have proposed an armistice for the purpose of negotiating a treaty of peace with the <rs>Confederate Generals</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>Ay, indeed!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>We in our simplicity supposed that it was the <rs>North</rs> who had blockaded these ports, to prevent the shipment of the cotton, which would have supplied to the <rs>South</rs> the sinews of war. Oh but the object is to take the cotton by force, and apply the proceeds of its sale to the conquest of its owners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>What an ingenious device!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>If it were only practicable, it would, no doubt, be a master stroke of policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>The expeditions against the cotton ports, whether successful or not, are not, therefore, likely to materially benefit the <rs>North</rs> and cannot restore to it the balance of military success, which, up to the last advices from New York, was unquestionably with the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>If the <rs>Federal Government</rs> be desirous of liberating the new cotton crop for the benefit of the world, all they have to do is to raise the blockade, and thenceforth our supply of cotton will only be limited by the extend of the crop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>It must be confessed that they are both dim and distant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/> Before these remarks meet the public eye, the stock of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> cotton here will be reduced to about <measure n="380000barrels" type="mass">380,000 bales</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/> As the year rolls on, this cotton supply question forces itself more and more upon our attention, and though for many months past we saw the approaching evil, while many of our contemporaries ridiculed our fears, we really stand aghast at the terrible reality of a dearth of cotton which is now confronting us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>We are convinced that, even at this moment, few realize the extent of distress which a dearth of cotton must bring on this country especially. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/> <hi rend="italics">Editors Dispatch:</hi>--In a recent number of your valuable paper, you express the opinion that the <rs>Northern Government</rs> would probably, in a short time, adopt the practice usual among belligerents, of exchanging the prisoners whom the fortune of war has thrown into their hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>This is a result most devoutly to be wished, and is <num value="1">one</num> for which our own Government should be constantly laboring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>The acknowledgment of us as <hi rend="italics">belligerents</hi> would mitigate the sufferings of our men who unfortunately fall into our opponent's hands; and, at the same time, would relieve our Government from heavy burdens in supporting those we may capture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>No doubt our Government has had this desirable object steadily in view, and yet it is, by its own acts, defeating its own efforts to establish this policy.--It has been paroling the wrong men. Let us look at the facts! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/> The majority of the prisoners in our hands consist of those taken at the famous <rs n="Battle of Bull Run" type="battle">battle of Bull Run</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>Nearly the whole of those prisoners were enlisted for <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> service, and their term of enlistment had expired, or was near its close, when the battle was fought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>Very soon afterwards their regiments were mustered out of the service of the <rs>Northern Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>These prisoners, then, were not any longer in the service of their Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>If they were released they had no regiments to which they could return without re-enlistment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>Many of them would never re-enter the service, and in the prostrated condition of business they would become a charge upon the community in which they lived, or the <rs>Government</rs>, falling to supply their wants, would increase the number of growlers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>They will receive no wages after their regiments were mustered out of service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>Thus it will be readily perceived that their Government is gainer by their detention. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/> The policy of exchanging will never be adopted whilst our Government holds such men in durance and paroles those who are enlisted for the war, or for <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, as was done by <persName n="Price,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00030" reg="mostcommon:Price,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Price</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Lexington, Fayette, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013887">Lexington</placeName>, Mo.--These men, and such as they, should be held with a tenacious grasp, and not <num value="1">one</num> should be released until a system of exchanging should be adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>Instead of releasing men, who can at once re-enter the service, let our Government send home those who cannot be compelled to serve immediately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>Now, if an exchange takes place, we must receive men who will go at once to their places in our ranks, whilst they must be paid for with men, who will have to be sent home, and who, perhaps will never find their way into the army again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>The hopelessness of such exchange is apparent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>Good policy and economy would dictate a release on parole of all <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> men. When they return home, finding that their Government does not recognize them as soldiers; that they will receive no pay during their confinement in our prisons &mdash; that the parole executed at their release is not considered binding by their Government; they will then begin to contrast the conduct of their Government with the liberality and kindness of our's, and thus fuel will be added to the slumbering volcano on which the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs> now rests, and the eruption that will destroy, not only the leaders of the <rs>Government</rs>, but the <rs>Government</rs> itself will be hastened. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>Being unfortunately <num value="1">one</num> of those prisoners, this writer subscribed the following obligation; <q>&#x0022;I promise on honor not to take up arms nor serve in any military capacity against the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>May we not properly look to our worthy Governor now, and to the <name>Legislature</name> when it assembles, for more efficient corrections? </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/> --It seems to have been the study of the <rs>Lincoln Administration</rs> to violate those fundamental principles of constitutional right, and to abandon those cardinal measures of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> policy which, of all others, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> had cherished most carefully and jealously from the foundation of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>Until the era of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00064" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Government would as soon have consented to give up the right of calling out its volunteer forces on land, as that of employing its privateers on the main, against a public enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>It has long been attempted by the great naval powers of the other continent to place privateering under the ban of public law, but it was the interest of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, whose domestic policy for <unclear></unclear> the keeping up of great war establishments on land and sea, to maintain the legality of privateering, which they did vigorously consistently, and successfully from the foundation of the <rs>Government</rs>, until the <rs>Lincoln Administration</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/><num value="1">One</num> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> acts of this Administration has been to surrender the traditional policy of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> on this subject and to denounce privateering as piracy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/> The denial of the right of search was also a part of the original policy of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>To make good <num value="1">one</num> denial of this claim we fought a war with <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> and our <unclear></unclear> has been supported by <unclear></unclear> of State paper and legal dialectics more able and convincing than has been called forth by any other measure of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> policy whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>We have carried our define of this right in beyond the doctrines of the public law of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> &mdash; going so far at time as to insist that the right should not be exercised under any circumstances or for any purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>To escape the effect of the <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> describe on into subject, we consented by treaty to maintain a great expense of health life, and treasure, a naval squad upon on the coast of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName> in conjunction with <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, in order that when search should be necessary upon <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> merchantmen, <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> naval vessels should be there to perform it. This right of search, asserted by the public law of the Old World, and practically enforced by <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, has elicited more opposition from our people and Government than any other pretension of foreign powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>Our opposition to it had been uniform, vigilant, jealous, and fierce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>The <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> people had thrown themselves against it with their whole heart and soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>What must be the surprise of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> public, both in the <rs>Federal</rs> and <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, to hear that the <rs>Lincoln Administration</rs>, abandoning the policy and trampling upon the traditions of generation past, has set itself up as a champion of this long denied right of search to the extent of actually exercising it upon a British vessel </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/> We went to war with <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct> because of her boarding our vessels in search of seamen claimed to be her subjects, and taking them off by force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>In the majority of <unclear></unclear> the seamen she took away were in <unclear></unclear> her subjects, in some few cases they were nebertive <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>We declared war, not because of her taking <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> off in these searches, but because of <hi rend="italics">the search itself,</hi> followed by the taking off of men of any character or nativity whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>We declared, as a measure of honor, that every precaution was taken in enlisting our crews, to prevent <name>British</name> seamen from being embraced in them, but having given this guaranty of honor we for bade the searching of our vessels for the purpose of taking away any class of persons whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/><placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> persisted in this practice, and war was the consequence.--Other causes conspired to inflame the mutual animosity, such as the paper blockades of <persName n="Pitt,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00065" reg="mostcommon:Pitt,nomatch:0"><surname>Pitt</surname></persName> and <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00066" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, which are now immolated by <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00067" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> on our Southern coast; but the leading and moving cause of the war were these searches of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> vessels and these violent seizures of men on board. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/> The <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> continent is now astounded by the intelligence that a Lincoln steamer has boarded a British mail packet on the high seas for the purpose of search and has captured and brought off Southern citizens claimed, we suppose, to be <hi rend="italics">subjects</hi> of the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>The <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> doctrines of search are not the only ones violate by this high banded measure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>If we are to take the <rs>Law</rs> of Nations as maintained in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> as interpreting the character of this act, there is much more here than the exercise of the right of search.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>That law does permit search for the purpose of capturing whatever is contraband of war provided the destination of the searched vessel be such as to render it probable that she was carrying the contraband subject for the benefit of the belligerent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>But it is clearly hold that an ambassador going from the belligerent power to a neutral court is not a lawful subject of capture, nor the purpose or dispatches carried by that ambassador appertaining to his representative functions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>The Law of Nations studies to facilitate the communication and correspondence of nation, and takes great and special pains to preserve the immunities of the representative character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>The great powers of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> have acknowledged the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> as a belligerent power; the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs> itself has done so by blockading our coast &mdash; As belligerents we have a right to communicate with foreign Governments and powers; and these ambassadors of ours, who were on the way to <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, were not lawful subjects of capture on a neutral vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>Even if we abandon our <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> position and concede the <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> doctrine of the right of search in all the latitude claimed for it yet, the search of a neutral vessel for ambassadorial functionaries and papers, was in violation even of the very law which concedes the right of search. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/> The act of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00068" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s commodore was not only a base betrayal of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> interests and abnegation of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> doctrines on the subject of search; but it was in violation also of the very laws of search, held in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, under the shadow of which the act was perpetrated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>If such a proceeding shall be submitted to by <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, her claim of being a house of refuge for the oppressed of all lands, must cease forever; for if her flag can not protect an ambassador commissioned by the <rs>Government</rs> of a belligerent power to communicate with her sovereign on his way to her own court, the protection of that flag to any class of persons must be worthless in the extreme. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>It appears to have been a preconcerted plan with the <name>Tories</name> of this end of the <rs>State</rs>, as all the bridges were destroyed on the same night, and, as some of the incendiaries who were captured the same night declared, that every railroad bridge between <placeName reg="Bristol, Bristol, Virginia" key="tgn,2110785">Bristol</placeName> and <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> were in ashes by that time.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/> The alleged crime for which my brother was arrested, according to the <hi rend="italics">Inquirer's</hi> account, was that he had been supplying our Confederacy with arms and provender, and for being a <q>&#x0022;noted Secessionist.&#x0022;</q> The article of the <hi rend="italics">Inquirer</hi> was not copied in the papers of this city, nor in the <hi rend="italics">Dispatch</hi> or <hi rend="italics"><rs n="Whig" type="political">Whig</rs>,</hi> of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, unless it appeared during the month of <dateStruct value="-09-"><month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct> or <dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>, when I could not took at any papers on account of a long and dangerous attack of illness, and yet, if it did appear in any of those papers, my friends would doubtless have informed me. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/> Knowing my brother's extreme cautiousness, I am disposed to believe the <hi rend="italics">Inquirer's</hi> account, so far as relates to the traffic in arms and forage, to be simply what the whole batch of Abolitionists are daily given to, viz: that of falsifying everything they do and that his arrest was imply for sympathizing with his native <placeName reg="South River, Rockbridge, Virginia" key="tgn,2681713">South</placeName>. </p>
