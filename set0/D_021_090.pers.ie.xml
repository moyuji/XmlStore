<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>In either and any event, the power which sustains the new Government must come from abroad, and by necessity, the direction of its policy will have the same origin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>Its unlimited expansion over this continent was its manifest destiny, and every approach of foreign influence over the affairs of the neighboring States, was jealously watched as a movement against the genius of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> freedom.
