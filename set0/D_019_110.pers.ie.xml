<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> From a letter in the <orgName n="Alexandria Gazette" type="newspaper">Alexandria Gazette</orgName>, dated <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>. <date value="05-09">May 9,</date> we have the following detail of affairs as that place. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> Yesterday, information was received from reliable sources that Federal troops were moving towards this point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Immediately the <rs type="place">Maryland heights</rs> which command the <rs type="place">Virginia hills</rs> and mountains in the immediate neighborhood were occupied by a large body of men. The Kentucky regiment and several companies of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> troops, comprised this force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>As the <rs>Kentucky</rs> troops, raised to a high pitch of enthusiasm at the near prospect of a fight, with elastic step and head erect marched across the bridge and defiled along the mountain side, from every point of the <unclear></unclear> which nature has formed around the place, thunders of cheers arose, coming along and reverberating among the numerous gorges of this wild and romantic pass. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The night, however, passed away without the slightest alarm, <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> is now, I think impregnable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>A seizure of the <rs type="place">Maryland Heights</rs> is absolutely necessary before the place can be taken; and with a <num value="1000">thousand</num> foot soldiers, this point might be held against <num value="2">two</num> times number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Situated at the mouth of a valley that extends to <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, and being the only pass through the <rs>Northern</rs> portion of the <rs type="place">Blue Ridge</rs> range of mountains, its military value is easily comprehended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>At this point, too, the <orgName n="Baltimore and Ohio Railroad" type="railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</orgName> crosses over into <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, and hence if the connection with the <placeName key="tgn,7014265" n="1.000 75" reg="ohio river, united states, north and central america">Ohio river</placeName> is desirable the bridge over the <rs>Potomac</rs>, which cost an immense sum, should be in the possession of the <rs>Federal</rs> troops. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> Last night about <num value="1000">one thousand</num> hogs and <num value="15">fifteen</num> horses were seized while passing over the <orgName n="Baltimore and Ohio Railroad" type="railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</orgName> through this place. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> This course, the authorities here have been compelled to adopt as retaliatory measures, to the action of the <rs>Federal</rs> troops at the <rs type="place">Relay House</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> An attack upon this place is confidently expected to occur within a few days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>We are fully prepared. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> A battery of <num value="4">four</num> cannon commands the railroad at the <rs type="place">Point of Rocks</rs> <measure n="12miles" type="distance">twelve miles</measure> below while the bridge across the <rs>Potomac</rs> here is commanded by another battery.--Scouting parties range the country for <measure n="15miles" type="distance">fifteen miles</measure> <name>North</name>, <name>East</name> and <name>West</name>, also, upon the slightest alarm can communicate by a system of signal agreed upon, with headquarters. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> Another account from <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> says: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> Detachments of volunteers were arriving at <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> from <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, and especially from <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, all anxious to join the armies of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, and to unite their fortunes with those of the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The Southern forces in the vicinity of <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> were said to be daily augmenting. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The object of the <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginians</rs> in burning the underwood away on the <rs>Maryland</rs> side was to obtain a full view of any hostile effort, and to keep the slope unobstructed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The reported laying of trains for the destruction of the bridge joining <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, across the <rs>Potomac</rs>, is not credited, as the bridge could easily be destroyed by fire before any hostile force could approach by ordinary means. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The <orgName n="Baltimore Sun" type="newspaper">Baltimore Sun</orgName>, of <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, in its notice of the <rs>Relay</rs> camp, gives some further particulars of the capture of the <q>&#x0022;steam gun&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> About <time value="11am">11 o'clock A. M.</time> some stir was manifest in the camp, and the <time value="12mid">12 M.</time> <placeName reg="Ellicott City, Howard, Maryland" key="tgn,2046992">Ellicott's Mills</placeName> train from <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, in charge of Conductor <persName n="Kenney,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Kenney,nomatch:0"><surname>Kenney</surname></persName>, on approaching the <rs type="place">Relay station</rs>, was taken possession of by order of <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName> and impressed into the service of a company of artillery and infantry, numbering several <num value="100">hundred</num> men, with <num value="2">two</num> pieces of cannon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The train, after a short detention sufficient to embark the men, left for the <rs type="place">Mills</rs> -- Then it was their mission became known to be the capture of the centrifugal steam gun of <persName n="Dickinson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Dickinson,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Dickinson</surname></persName>, then reported to be on its way from this city to <placeName reg="Ellicott City, Howard, Maryland" key="tgn,2046992">Ellicott's Mills</placeName>, over the turnpike, drawn by <num value="6">six</num> mules, and in charge of <persName n="Dickinson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="nearbymention:Dickinson,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Dickinson</surname></persName>, the inventor, and <num value="2">two</num> men who acted as drivers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The gun, it was said, had been taken out for trial at long range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The train reached the <rs type="place">Mills</rs> almost simultaneously with the gun, which was quietly taken possession of, with <persName n="Dickinson,Mister,Charles,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="default:Dickinson,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName n="Charles">Chas.</foreName> <surname>Dickinson</surname></persName> and the men in charge of it, without resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The train then returned to the <rs>Relay</rs>, bringing the gun, which was drawn by the mules attached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The Relay camp was quite lively over the capture last evening, and the gun is the subject of much curious inspection. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> It has been erroneously asserted that the centrifugal gun belongs to the city of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>This is not so. The gun belongs to the inventor, and if there existed any intention to carry the gun out of the city it was not known to the city authorities. </p> </q><bibl n="Harper's Ferry"></bibl></cit>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> A letter from <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>, which we copy, contains some information which will interest our readers: </p> <cit><q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The steam-<term type="ship">tug</term> <rs type="ship">Yankee</rs>, of <num value="2">two</num> guns, was sent to reconnoitre near the mouth of the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>, and was fired at from <placeName reg="Cummings Point, Mason, Washington" key="tgn,2271639">Cummings' Point</placeName>, where the secessionists have a heavy battery planted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The shell passed over the steamer, and she immediately sought shelter under the guns of the <rs>Cumberland</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>About <num value="100">one hundred</num> men were at work in the forge shop, preparing for mounting guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>It requires <num value="300">300</num> men to do guard duty at once, the fort being about <measure n="1mile" type="distance">one mile</measure> in circumference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>A very large garrison is, therefore, necessary to properly mount guard and relieve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/> [From the <orgName n="Manchester Guardian" type="newspaper">Manchester Guardian</orgName>.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> <q>&#x0022;Who began it?&#x0022;</q> will, no doubt, be hereafter a question warmly discussed by historians, of the civil war, which is now past praying against, in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>This point is not by any means so easy to settle as it may appear to be. * * * It appears that a messenger from the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> conveyed to <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> and <persName n="Pickens,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Pickens,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Pickens</surname></persName>, the <rs>Governor</rs> of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, an announcement that the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities had determined to proceed immediately to extreme measures for the purpose of introducing reinforcements of men and supplies of provisions into the fortress. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/> This was an overt step towards coercion which, supposing the seceders to be justified at all in throwing off the authority of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, will, we think, be held to vindicate them from the range of blood-guiltiness in their determination to reduce <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> by force, its peaceable surrender having <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> been formally refused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>It would be a very strained interpretation of the sentiment of humanity to suppose that a nation or a party which has been served with a formal notice of attack, should wait until the threat is carried into execution, for fear of being clothed with the responsibility of aggression. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/> There is reason for looking at this part of the question rather closely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>The only plausible explanation of <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s conduct is that he has thought that a political object was to be obtained by putting the <name>Southerners</name> in the wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>This reproach it was hoped that they might be made subject to, if they could be man&#x0152;uvred into firing the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>We, however, only infer this to have been the calculation, because we do not know any other hypothesis fitted to meet the strange circumstances of the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Great as has been the manifest and unaffected bewilderment of the <rs>Cabinet</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> since its construction &mdash; and of the leading men in the <rs>Government</rs> before they actually entered upon office &mdash; we must decline to suppose them capable of imagining that this affair of the <rs>Federal</rs> fortresses, within the territory of the seceding States, has been dealt with to the utmost advantage, from the plain and straight forward view of their duty as rulers, which they profess to take.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>For weeks past it has been rumored, with every appearance of the rumor's being true, that <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> was to be quietly evacuated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>To say nothing of the authority on which this statement was circulated from time to time, people naturally supposed that, had there been any serious intention to maintain the fort, it would have been put in execution as soon as the <rs>Lincoln</rs> administration came into power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>The interval since then having been sedulously employed by the <rs>South</rs> <rs n="Carolinian" type="group">Carolinians</rs> in throwing up batteries and collecting men and material, it has been long known that the place was untenable, even if any political end could be gained by successfully resisting at this point pretensions, the real strength of which would have to be put to the test elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>If there were any doubt as to the soundness of this conclusion on strategical grounds, it would be removed by the event. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/> From the character which <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,Samuel,,,:1"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> holds, and from the manner in which his duties in the earlier part of this unhappy struggle were performed, there is no reason to question his being a man of resolution; and the soldiers of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> army are as little addicted as any troops in the world to surrendering posts entrusted to them, except under the pressure of necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>The <rs n="Battle of Charleston" type="battle">battle of Charleston</rs>, or by whatever name it may be called in history, narrowly escapes, if it does escape, being ridiculous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>If the interchange of shots went on, as it appears to have done, for <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> and an intermediate night, it would seem hardly possible but that some lives must have been lost; but we are not told that such was the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>All the information vouchsafed is, that none of the officers of the <rs>Federal</rs> garrison were wounded, and that none of the <rs>South</rs> <rs n="Carolinian" type="group">Carolinians</rs> were killed. -- Whatever ludicrous associations connected with the wars of the <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italian</rs> States of the middle ages, or of the <rs n="Spanish-American" type="group">Spanish American</rs> republics, may be recalled by these particulars, it should be a subject of rejoicing to every rational man that the useless horrors of an assault on the fort were spared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>As soon as its walls had received a certain amount of damage, the effect of the firing of the wooden structures within the work, <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,Samuel,,,:1"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> struck his flag, like a sensible soldier, and was conveyed with his men to <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, where they had doubtless had the most hospitable reception, and the best treatment compatible with their state as prisoners of war. It is worthy of special observation that the fleet off the harbor took no part in the conflict, as we must fairly presume it would have done if any serious intention of resisting the attack of the secessionists had been entertained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>The whole affair looks like nothing so much as a refusal on the part of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> authorities to leave a place in which they did not desire to remain without the application of just as much force as would entitle them to all the advantages to be derived from an action for assault and battery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/> It may be premature to say how far the calculations on which this course was taken are likely to be justified by the event.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>To our limited power of judgment it appears, we confess, to complete the character of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s policy as including every known kind of blunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>Having <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> neglected to fight until the chance of doing so with success had passed away, he has now undertaken and provoked a conflict under circumstances which ensured his being humiliated and beaten, without the possibility of striking an effective blow in return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>Morally, he is to the full as responsible as the <rs>Government</rs> of <persName n="Montgomery,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="nearbymention:Montgomery,F.,P.,,"><surname>Montgomery</surname></persName> for transferring the matters in dispute between them from the arbitrament of reason to that of arms, for his formal intimation to them that he was about to resort to force was a challenge that they could not be expected to disregard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>If he meant what he said, it was the virtual commencement of war; if he did not, it was still more culpable as idle menace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>We say nothing in justification of the revolt of the seceding States; we only remark that <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> seems to us to have thrown away, with singular impartiality, every advantage of argument, and of material position, which he possessed over them at the beginning.-- His position was a most arduous <num value="1">one</num>, beyond doubt, but he need not have exerted himself to make the most of all its inconveniences and dangers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>He has lost <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, which was perhaps necessary; but has he succeeded in exciting in the wavering communities of the <rs>Border States</rs> the disgust and apprehension which were desired, in order permanently to alienate them from the seceders?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>Nothing appears less probable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>It will easily be made to appear that the <name>Southerners</name> have only taken up the sword when an appeal to it was made inevitable, and that with scarcely any bloodshed, they have inflicted on the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> a conspicuous reverse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>In regard both to the moral attractions of their cause, and to their prospects of ultimate success, it may fairly be inferred that they will have been raised in estimation by these events. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>When it was announced that civil war had actually broken out between the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs>, a shudder ran through every frame; and if, as we hope, the next arrival brings the consolatory tidings that it began and ended at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, a feeling of intense pleasure will be felt in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and throughout <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/> A foolish idea prevails at the <rs>North</rs> that the <rs>South</rs> cannot raise her own provisions, and will starve outright if the war be kept up.--The idea is born of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Helper,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00193" reg="mostcommon:Helper,nomatch:0"><surname>Helper</surname></persName></hi> and is only a type of a class of ideas on this subject by which the <rs>North</rs> is most industriously deluding itself.--The Census tables show that the <rs>South</rs> raises more provisions per man than the <rs>North</rs>, and nearly as much as the great grain-growing region of the <rs>West</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>The statistics of the country also show that the <rs>Eastern</rs> manufacturing free States consume an equivalent of all the surplus products of the <rs>Western</rs> free States; and that the free-labor North, taken as a unit, exports little or nothing abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>The gold of <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName> and about <num value="25000000">twenty-five millions</num> of miscellaneous truck constitute the sum total of Northern exportations of Northern growth and production.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>The surplus provisions of the <rs>Western</rs> free States are nearly consumed by the <rs>Eastern</rs> manufacturing free States.--The whole exports of the late Union, with the exceptions we have stated, went from the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>If Western grain went off from New York, it was but little in excess of the quantities of Southern provisions sent to Northern manufacturers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>It was liberated by virtue of the receipt of Southern provisions, and really represented only an export surplus furnished by the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>With the exceptions stated the whole exportation of the late Union, amounting to over <num value="300000000">three hundred millions</num> a year, went from the <rs>South</rs>, of which cotton alone furnished <num value="191000000">one hundred and ninety-one millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>Besides the <num value="300000000">three hundred millions</num> sent by the <rs>South</rs> abroad, she sent also to the <rs>North</rs> about <num value="150000000">one hundred and fifty millions</num> of dollars worth of produce, cotton furnishing of course the largest item of the amount.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>Considering the <rs>North</rs> as a foreign country, the exports of the <rs>South</rs>, in time of peace, are <num value="450000000">four hundred and fifty millions</num> a year. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/> This is the largest exportation for the ratio of population known in the commerce of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>If the surplus of its products sent abroad measure the wealth of a country, then is the <rs>South</rs>, the number of its population being considered, the wealthiest country in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>Yet the <rs>North</rs> deludes itself with the belief that the <rs>South</rs> is weak, poor, and on the point of starvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>A country purely agricultural; a country of prolific soil and almost prurient vegetation; a country with the best organized system of labor on the globe; a country exporting <num value="450000000">four hundred and fifty millions</num> of dollars worth of surplus products a year; that country poor, weak and stinted for food!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>What follies and stupidities are sectional prejudice capable of leading a people into! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/> This hallucination has its origin in the fact that many of the <rs>Southern</rs> planters contiguous to the great rivers purchase their corn and bacon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>They purchase because the same hand who would raise <measure n="150dollars" type="currency">one hundred and fifty dollars</measure> worth of corn raises <measure n="450dollars" type="currency">four hundred and fifty dollars</measure> worth of cotton or sugar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>The planter, therefore, who purchases, and who increases to that extent the product of his cotton or sugar crop, nearly doubles the value of the labor he employs in the substitution. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/> But how fallacious is the inference, that because a few Southern planters, on the great highways, purchase corn and bacon, therefore the whole <rs>South</rs> will starve, if cut off from trade with the pork and corn raising States of the <rs>Union</rs>!
