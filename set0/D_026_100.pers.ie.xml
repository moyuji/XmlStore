<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Again, this dark face, strongly marked, livid and crow-footed, and fringed with coarse and tangled hair, is so uncouth and so rugose that it narrowly escapes being either terrible or grotesque.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>But the possible grotesque is obviated, the imminent terrible is smoothed away, by a peculiar soft, almost feminine, expression of melancholy which to me at least seemed to pervade the countenance of this remarkable man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>My interview with him was of very brief duration, and mainly made up of commonplaces.--Of course, he said that he was glad to see me; that he hoped I liked my stay; that I had come in a very critical period, and that the country presented a very different aspect to that which it once had.--<persName n="Sumner,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00045" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName> informed him that I purposed &#x0022;Illustrating&#x0022; in public what I had seen in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>-- &#x0022;Ah,&#x0022; said the <rs>President</rs>, &#x0022;indeed!

At last she spoke again, and once more in the interrogatory form:--&#x0022;And you keep your health, sir?&#x0022; I answered this very kind inquiry as best I might, when, fortuitously, it occurred to me that some years ago, in <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>, having to go in much better society than I am in the habit of frequenting at home, I had sought the assistance of a dancing mistress, and at the outlay of about <num value="50">fifty</num> rubles, learnt a series of bows, or &#x0022;reverences,&#x0022; for grand occasions.

<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/> --In view of the scarcity and exorbitant prices of sugar, syrup, alcohol, and other products of saccharine plants, we would urge the planters to devote a few acres to maize and sorghum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>Those who cannot procure the seed of sorgho or imphee, should plant maize, which has been demonstrated to be equally rich in saccharine matter when cultivated for that purpose. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/> We propose, in these papers, to give a few hints, not on our own experience, but on the experience of others in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> and <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, in the cultivation of sorghum and maize, and the manufacture of sugar, syrup, and alcohol from their juices. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/> Select a piece of your best land suitable for corn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>Make the drills from <num value="3">three</num> to <measure n="4feet" type="distance">four feet</measure> apart, running as nearly parallel to the course of the sun as the nature of your land will permit, that the plants may receive the full benefit of the sun &mdash; Drill the seed and thin out, leaving a plant every <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6inches" type="distance">six inches</measure>--not over <measure n="6inches" type="distance">six inches</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/> Cultivate the same as corn, taking care not to cover the prop roots by hilling, nor to injure the roots by deep ploughing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/> The object of close planting is to prevent the formation of ears of corn on the plant; that the sugar may elaborate itself within the stalk instead of expending itself in nourishing the grain. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/> Should ears appear, however, they must be removed; and, in so doing, care should be taken not to bruise or injure the plant, as the air, coming in contact with the sap through a bruise in the stalk will cause acetic action, and render it unfit for our purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>Therefore, the removal of the ear should not be attempted whilst the plant is too young and tender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>Wait until the beginning of the formation of grain on the young cob. The <hi rend="italics">modus operandi</hi> is immaterial, so it does not injure the plant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>The shears, knife, or fingers, may be used. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/> Where a large field is selected, it would be preferable to make several plantings of the crop, with an interval of a week or <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> between each planting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>It would require less force to attend to the removing of the ears, and give more time for grinding, boiling, etc. Quite an advantage, should the capacity of the mill and kettles prove too small for the crop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>Besides, it would enable several neighboring planters to purchase in partnership a mill and kettles, and cultivate <num value="1">one</num> large field in common. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/> The mill boilers, etc, should be erected as near to the crop as possible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/> The directions given for maize are applicable to the cultivation of sorghum, except as to close planting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>Plant in rows of from <num value="3">three</num> to <measure n="4feet" type="distance">four feet</measure> apart and from <num value="12">twelve</num> or <measure n="15inches" type="distance">fifteen inches</measure> in the row. Do not kill the plants, thereby depriving their roots of the influences of the sun and air. The soil should be frequently stirred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>A hoe may be used between the plants in the drill. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/> Soak the seed <num value="1">one</num> or <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> before planting. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/> It has been suggested that soils containing ammonia or other saline substances in excess are unsuitable for sugar-bearing plants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>We would therefore avoid lands recently made rich with animal manure. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/> We again appeal to planters to devote at least a small portion of land to sorghum or maize, or both.--<hi rend="italics"><orgName n="La Grange Reporter" type="newspaper">La Grange Reporter</orgName>.</hi> </p> </div3>

<head>Northern retaliation.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/> The kind-hearted and courteous Northern Government is quite out of temper about <placeName key="tgn,6002083" n="1.000 95" reg="fort pillow, lauderdale, tennessee">Fort Pillow</placeName>, and <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00151" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> threatens to retaliate horribly if he finds that his subjects &mdash; <rs type="color">white</rs> or <rs type="color">black</rs> &mdash; were put to the sword by <persName n="Forrest,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00152" reg="mostcommon:Forrest,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Forrest</surname></persName> after he captured the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>It is, circumstanced and situated as we are, decidedly amusing to observe the holy horror which is excited in the breast of the representative man of Northern coarseness and brutality by the alleged massacre at <placeName key="tgn,6002083" n="1.000 95" reg="fort pillow, lauderdale, tennessee">Fort Pillow</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>A volume could not hold a simple recital of the most atrocious and bloody deeds perpetrated by <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00153" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s hordes of mercenaries and cut-throats upon our people, both soldiers and unoffending and defenceless and helpless citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>Early in the war we have the murder of <num value="10">ten</num> most resectable citizens of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> by the <rs>Federal</rs> <persName n="McNeal,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00154" reg="mostcommon:McNeal,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McNeal</surname></persName>, because a traitor to the <rs>South</rs>, who had enlisted in the <rs>Federal</rs> army, was missing, and that traitor appeared after the executions had taken place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>Then there was the hanging of <persName n="Mumford,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00155" reg="mostcommon:Mumford,nomatch:0"><surname>Mumford</surname></persName>; the shooting of <rs n="Kentuckian" type="group">Kentuckians</rs> in the service of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> by <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00156" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>; the driving of helpless women and children into the <rs>Confederate</rs> lines without the means of subsistence, after robbing them of all their earthly possessions; the insulting and outraging of women; the cold- blooded murder of Southern planters, down to that of the killing of a highly respectable and venerable citizen of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, beaten to death the other day by negro slaves enlisted by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> to increase the barbarism and terrors of the war; and the still later brutalities of these same black soldiers in <placeName reg="Narsemond county">Narsemond county</placeName>, in this State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>These, with the <num value="1000">thousands</num> of other horrible deeds, which are worthy the worst of demons, not to speak of the <name>Dahlgren</name> scheme to burn and sack <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and massacre her people, have been perpetrated by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> hordes with the approbation of their Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>No word of censure for any of the brutalities of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> armies has ever been uttered by that Government; no word of regret or remonstrance has been uttered by the <rs>Northern</rs> communities who have grown rich on the commerce and the products of Southern toil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>Even such sentimentalists as <persName n="Everett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00157" reg="mostcommon:Everett,nomatch:0"><surname>Everett</surname></persName>, and even the gentler sex, living in luxury and such elegance as pleases the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> taste, contemplate the excesses of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> soldiery with satisfaction, or, at best, passive coldness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/> This interminable catalogue of inhumanities include many that demanded retaliation, and our Government omitted a right &mdash; may we not say a duty?--in not meting out to the bloody hell hounds who perpetrated them blood for blood and life for life. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/> Now, supposing the assertion true in every particular, <num value="1">one</num> of our officers avails himself of a rule of civilized warfare and puts to the word a part of a garrison which had, with no hope of successful resistance, refused to surrender after repeated summoning, and occasioned a sacrifice of life in the storming of their defences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>This measure, by which a wholesome lesson and example was given that may save the effusion of blood hereafter, has elicited the threatening of the aforesaid chief of the <rs>Federal</rs> despotism. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/> Well, lot him do his worst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>The South has no fears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>The Northern Government has essayed worse calamities for the <rs>South</rs> than even its threatened retaliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>It has tried insurrections and even famine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>Yet the <rs>South</rs> is stronger and more resolute than over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>Should <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00158" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> retaliate it will only force us to do what we had long since a right to do, and inaugurate a series of retaliations which do not at present promise to us the chief suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>So let the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> &#x0022;imbrue&#x0022; as soon as they please.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>The South has a long unsettled account that will surely be presented whenever the work is begun. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head>Pressing horses &mdash; a word for the horse.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/> The Government ought to have all that it needs to carry on this war with a foe who would, if he could, take everything, whether relating to liberty or property, belonging to the citizen. --But it is not inappropriate or injudicious to suggest that what is taken from the private means of the people for this object ought to be employed to the best advantage, and used with the greatest economy, in order to lighten the draft upon the citizen as much as possible; for he, if a farmer, has to provide the supplies for the army as well as the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>Therefore, when a horse is pressed he ought to be taken care of. He ought to be treated kindly, fed as well as possible, and not overtaxed with work, if avoidable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>Horses and mules are very scarce, and every care should be taken to check the mortality amongst them in the war. We are satisfied that in the beginning of the war they were recklessly sacrificed, by neglect and by mad and foolish overriding and overdriving.--These evil practices may not be so excessive now as in the beginning; but we are sure no man can deny that there is still a wanton waste of horseflesh in the service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/> These suggestions are especially proper at the present moment, since the <rs>Government</rs> officers are now pressing into service a great many horses and mules.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>Every visit they make to the farmer diminishes his force for the purposes of raising crops for the general consumption, and when his horse or mule is taken, it should be treated so as to make the interval before another draft upon his means as long as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>It is painful to see so many condemned horses and mules sold at the many posts in the <name>Confeder</name> any so often during the year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>Their condition speaks badly for the humanity of the army, and both humanity and public utility &mdash; nay, the very weal of the country &mdash; demand that there should be a great reformation, in order to protect them and prolong their usefulness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/> This is no idle complaint, simply to indulge a spirits of grumbling, but is a practical and truthful representation of the facts in the case, and the real interests of both Government and people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>It is important that some means should be taken for the protection of that noble animal which takes such a conspicuous part in this war, and which is endeared to every chivalrious heart or his patient endurance, his high spirit in the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>Oh, spare the noble horse!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>If it cannot be done otherwise, a department should be organized of inspectors and farriers, with hospitals and means of treatment, for his resuscitation and cure. </p> </div3>

<head>&#x0022;Skies bright and Brightening.&#x0022;</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/> At the close of an important political campaign, we think the <rs>Harrison Presidential</rs> election, when every other <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrat</rs> in he land was submerged in the waves of tribulation and despair, the venerable editor of the <orgName n="Richmond Enquirer" type="newspaper">Richmond <hi rend="italics">Enquirer</hi></orgName> raised his head above the surrounding sea, and sent forth a shout of hope and determination that astonished both his friends and enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>He seemed invigorated by the copious drenching <unclear></unclear> had received, and, scanning the troubled <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> firmament with philosophical composure, announced, in a short time, that the &#x0022;skies&#x0022; were &#x0022;bright and brightening.&#x0022; The light of his own sanguine temperament threw its lustre upon the sombre features of the sky, and a vigorous faith, which many waters could not quench, revealed with telescopic power, star after star of victory coming out in triumphant procession after the retiring clouds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>The results justified his political sagacity, and rebuked the folly and faintheartedness which cowers under defeat and disaster. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/> After the reverses of last summer, and the defeat at Chickamanga, a hopeful man had but little chance of making himself heard amid these doleful melodies of the <rs type="place">Dismal Swamp</rs>, which on every side filled the air. If any <num value="1">one</num>, within a short period thereafter, had presumed to whisper, &#x0022;Skies bright and brightening,&#x0022; his friends would have considered him a candidate for Bedlam.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>Yet what practical benefits followed the <rs>Federal</rs> success at Chickamanga?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>How far did they extend their invasion thereby?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>How much nearer did they get to <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>?. How many miles of subjugation did they add to their advance?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>The very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> effort of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00159" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> to follow it up was met by a stunning blow from <persName n="Cleburne,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00160" reg="mostcommon:Cleburne,nomatch:0"><surname>Cleburne</surname></persName>'s veterans, that sent him back to his fortifications in double quick time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>No great battle has occurred since that Federal victory, and yet the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> cause is weaker and the <rs>Southern</rs> cause stronger than it was before that event.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>Why are the enemy disheartened, dolorons and paralyzed in the arms of success?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>Because all such victories, barren of results, are virtually defeats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>What must they think of a war in which they run the risk of battles lost, and in which battles gained are equivalent in their results to battles lost?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>No wonder that gold goes up and confidence comes down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>The enormous extent of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> defles the capacities of subjugation, and a victory like <placeName reg="Chickamauga, Walker, Georgia" key="tgn,7013598">Chickamauga</placeName> developes the fact, and in more disheartening in the end than a defeat. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/> Now, indeed, a man may cry, &#x0022;Skies bright and brightening,&#x0022; without engendering suspicious of his sanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>The dimmest eye can now perceive the rainbow that spans the storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>The faintest heart can draw inspiration from the stars that are beginning to reveal themselves in the tempest tost sky.--The most distrustful mariner can now look with respect upon the bold navigator whom but yesterday they were ready to throw overboard, because amid the ominous agitation of the seas he heard not only the roar of breakers, but discovered the signs of a continent rising in freshness and majesty from the waves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>The incredulity which looked upon <persName n="Paul,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00161" reg="mostcommon:Paul,nomatch:0"><surname>Paul</surname></persName> as a criminal, because a viper had fastened upon his hand, was ready to worship him as a <name n="God" type="God">God</name> when they saw that he had escaped all harm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>We do not commend these extreme fluetuations of public sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>Far from it. We ought to be patient and hopeful in misfortune; calm and cautions in success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>In the language of the <rs>English</rs> litany, we should pray for deliverance &#x0022;in all times of our properity,&#x0022;as well as &#x0022;in all times of our adversity. &#x0022;--We should neither make man the object of our fears nor of our confidence, but fear Him alone, and trust in Him alone, who rules the destinies of nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>We should exhaust all human forethought, vigillance, and energy, to secure success, and then, with calm and confiding souls, commend events to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>. </p> </div3>
