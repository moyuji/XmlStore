<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> Out of the <num value="1100">eleven hundred</num> men <persName n="Tarleton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Tarleton,nomatch:0"><surname>Tarleton</surname></persName> led into the <rs n="Battle of Cowpens" type="battle">battle of Cowpens</rs>, he saved but <num value="400">four hundred</num>. <num value="2">Two</num> cannon, <num value="800">eight hundred</num> muskets, a <num value="100">hundred</num> dragoon-horses, and tents and ammunition, were the fruits of this victory. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> Scarcely had the roar of battle ceased before <persName n="Morgan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Morgan,nomatch:0"><surname>Morgan</surname></persName> began to retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>He knew <persName><foreName>Cornwallis</foreName></persName>, with a powerful army, was close upon him, and an hour's delay might lose him all the fruits of his gallant achievement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The <rs>British Commander</rs> strained every nerve to cut him off, and recover the spoils and prisoners that had been taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>But with such vigor had <persName n="Morgan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Morgan,nomatch:0"><surname>Morgan</surname></persName> pushed his retreat that his adversary was unable to overtake him, and came up the <name>Catawha</name> just in time to see the last of the <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName> form on the opposite shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Still it was possible to reach him before he could affect a junction with <persName n="Greene,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Greene,nomatch:0"><surname>Greene</surname></persName>, and he resolved to spare no sacrifice to secure this result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>He immediately ordered the baggage of the army to be destroyed, so that it could move rapidly and without encumbrance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Liquor casks were staved in before the soldiers, wagons consumed, and all those things which go to make up the little comforts of a camp committed to the flames.--<persName><foreName>Cornwallis</foreName></persName> set the example, and, beginning with his own baggage, the destruction continued till it reached the last private.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>It took <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> to complete it; and then, stripped like a wrestler for the struggle, the <rs>British General</rs> moved forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>But <persName n="Greene,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Greene,nomatch:0"><surname>Greene</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>with only a single aid, and a sergeant's guard of dragoons, had left the main army, and pressed forward a <measure n="150miles" type="distance">hundred and fifty miles</measure> to succor <persName n="Morgan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Morgan,nomatch:0"><surname>Morgan</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The victors of <placeName key="tgn,2023848" n="1.000 1" reg="Pannell, Walton, Georgia">Cowpens</placeName> received him with acclamations as he rode into camp with him at their head they feared nothing, and joyfully entered on the race with their adversary. </p> 
<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head>Skillful retreat through the <name>Carolinas</name>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> Greens had ordered the main army to rendezvous at <placeName reg="Guilford, New Haven, Connecticut" key="tgn,2016959">Guilford</placeName>, and thither he now directed his steps, closely watched by <persName><foreName>Cornwallis</foreName></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> To understand the ground over which this remarkable retreat was performed, it is necessary only to glance at a map. <num value="3">Three</num> large rivers rise in the northwest parts of <placeName reg="South River, Georgia, United States" key="tgn,2681709">South</placeName> and <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, and flow in a southeasterly direction into the <rs>Atlantic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The lower or more southern <num value="1">one</num> is the <name>Catawha</name>, which empties into the <name>Santes</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The next, north of it, and nearly parallel, is the <rs>Yadkin</rs>, emptying into the <rs>Pedee</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The last, and more northern, is the <rs>Dan</rs>, which soon leaves its southwesterly direction and winds backwards and forwards across the <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> line, and finally falls into the <rs>Roanoke</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/><persName n="Greene,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Greene,nomatch:0"><surname>Greene</surname></persName> was now on the <name>Catawha</name>, or must southern river, and directed his steps north, his line of progress cutting the <rs>Yadkin</rs> and Dan. To place a deep river between <num value="2">two</num> armies effectually separates them for some time, while a retreating army between <num value="1">one</num> and a powerful adversary is almost sure to be ruined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Therefore, the great effort of <persName><foreName>Cornwallis</foreName></persName> was to overtake his weak enemy somewhere between the rivers, while the latter strained every nerve to keep a deep stream dividing him and his roe. <persName n="Greene,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Greene,nomatch:0"><surname>Greene</surname></persName> was now across the <name>Catawha</name>, which, swollen by the recent rains, prevented <persName><foreName>Cornwallis</foreName></persName> from crossing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>But at length it began to subside, and the latter determined, by a night march to a private ford near <placeName reg="Salisbury, Rowan, North Carolina" key="tgn,2076487">Salisbury</placeName>, to deceive his antagonist, and cross without opposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>But <persName n="Greene,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Greene,nomatch:0"><surname>Greene</surname></persName> had been on the alert, and stationed a body of militia there to dispute the passage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>At day break, the <rs>British</rs> column was seen silently approaching the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>A deep hush was on everything, broken only by the roar of the swollen waters, and not a living thing was to be seen on the shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Twilight still rested on the forest, and the forbid foam-covered stream looked doubly appalling in the gloom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The rain was falling in torrents, and the <rs>British</rs> commander, as he reined up his steed on the slippery banks, looked long and anxiously on the farther side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>There all was will and silent; but faint flashes of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> fires in the woods told too well that he had been forestalled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Still, the order to advance was given, and the column boldly entered the channel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>With muskets poised above their hands to keep them dry, and learning against such other to steady their slippery footing, the grenadiers pushed forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>As they advanced the water deepened, until it flowed in a strong, swift current, up to their waists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The cavalry went plunging through, but the rapid stream bore many of them, both horses and riders, downward in the darkness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The head of the column had already reached the centre of the river, when the voices of the sentinels rang through the darkness, and the next moment their guns flashed through the storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs>, <num value="500">five hundred</num> in number, immediately poured in a destructive volley, but the <rs>British</rs> troops pressed steadily forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Soldier after soldier rolled over in the flood and <persName><foreName>Cornwallis</foreName></persName>'s <orgName n="horse">horse</orgName> was shot under him; but the noble animal, with a desperate effort, carried his rider to the bank before he fell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The intrepid troops at length reached the shore, and routed the militia.--<persName><foreName>Cornwallis</foreName></persName> was now on the same side of the river with his antagonist, and prepared to follow up his advantage with vigor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>But the latter no sooner heard that the enemy had passed the <name>Catawha</name>, that he ordered the retreat to the <rs>Yadkin</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Through the drenching rain and deep mud, scarcely halting to eat or rest, the ragged troops dragged their weary way; and on the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> day reached the river, and commenced crossing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>In the meantime, the recent rains had swollen this river also, so that by the time Greens had safely effected the passage, the current was foaming by on a level with its banks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>He had urged everything forward with the utmost speed, and at mid-night, just as the last of the <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName> were embarking, they were sainted with a volley from the advanced guard of the <rs>British</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>When the morning light broke over the scene, there lay the <num value="2">two</num> armies within sight of each other, and the blessed <rs>Yadkin</rs> surging and roaring in threatening accents between, as if on purpose to daunt the invaders from its bosom.--Stung into madness at this <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> escape of their enemy, the <rs>English</rs> lined the shore with artillery, and opened a fierce cannonade on the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>But the army, protected by an elevated ridge, rested quietly and safely behind it. In a little cabin, just showing its roof above the rocks, <persName n="Greene,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Greene,nomatch:0"><surname>Greene</surname></persName> took up his quarters, and while his troops were reposing, commenced writing his dispatches.--The enemy suspecting the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> General had established himself there, directed his artillery upon it, and soon the rocks rung with the balls that smoked and bounded from their sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>It was not long before the roof of the cabin was struck, and the shingles and clap boards began to fly about in every direction &mdash; but the stern warrior within never once looked up, and wrote on as calmly as if in his peaceful home. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> <measure n="4days" type="date">Four days</measure> the <rs>British General</rs> tarried on the shores of the <rs>Yadkin</rs>, and then, as the waters subsided, again put his army in motion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Moving, lower down the river, he crossed over, and started anew after his adversary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>But the latter, ever vigilant, was already on his march for <placeName reg="Guilford, New Haven, Connecticut" key="tgn,2016959">Guilford</placeName>, where he resolved to make a stand, and strike this bold Briton to the heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>But on reaching <placeName reg="Guilford, New Haven, Connecticut" key="tgn,2016959">Guilford</placeName>, he learned, to his dismay, that the reinforcements promised him had not arrived.--The <name>English</name> army was nearly double that of his own, and all well tried, disciplined soldiers; and he knew it would be madness to give battle on such disadvantageous terms.--There was, therefore, no remedy but to retreat, and this had now become a difficult matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>In the hope of being able to sustain himself at <placeName reg="Guilford, New Haven, Connecticut" key="tgn,2016959">Guilford</placeName>, he had suffered his enemy to approach so near, and block him in so effectually, that there was but <num value="1">one</num> possible way of escapes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Cornwallis at last deemed his prey secure. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> On the <date value="02-10">10th of February</date> this battle of man&#x0153;uvres again commenced, and the <num value="2">two</num> armies, now only <measure n="25miles" type="distance">twenty-five miles</measure> apart, stretched forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/><persName><foreName>Cornwallis</foreName></persName> supposed his adversary would make for the upper fords of the <rs>Dan</rs>, as there was nothing but ferries below, and hence put his army in such a position that he could crush him at once; but <persName n="Greene,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Greene,nomatch:0"><surname>Greene</surname></persName> quietly withdrew towards the <rs>Lower Dan</rs>, where he ordered boats to be congregated, in which he could transport his troops over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>His object in this was twofold: <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, to place a deep, instead of a fordable, river between him and his formidable adversary, and secondly, to be in a situation to effect a junction with the reinforcements he expected from <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Discovering at once the error under which <persName><foreName>Cornwallis</foreName></persName> labored, he added to it by sending a large detachment to man&#x0153;uvre in front, as if the upper fords were indeed the object of his efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/><persName n="Williams,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Williams,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Williams</surname></persName> commanded this chosen body of men, and marched boldly against the entire <name>English</name> army.--The <name>British</name> commander, thinking it to be the advance guard of the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs>, began hastily to contract his lines, and make preparations for a fierce resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>This detained his march, and allowed <persName n="Greene,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Greene,nomatch:0"><surname>Greene</surname></persName> to get a start, without which he must inevitably have been lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The <rs>English</rs> were without baggage; indeed, the whole army had been converted into <orgName n="Light Infantry" type="infantry">light infantry</orgName>, which enabled it to move with much more alacrity than that of the </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>Every deep-laid plan was thwarted, every surprise disconcerted, and every sudden movement to crush it eluded by its tireless, sleepless leaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>His steady columns closed more threateningly and rapidly on the guard; pushing it fiercely before them, and scorning all meaner success, pressed forward for the greater prize.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/> But at <time value="12pm">noon</time> a single horseman was seen coming in a swift gallop, up the road along which <persName n="Greene,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00030" reg="mostcommon:Greene,nomatch:0"><surname>Greene</surname></persName> had lately passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/> The main portion of the guard was now hastily dispatched by the shortest route to the ferry, while <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00031" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> still hovered with his legion in front of <persName><foreName>Cornwallis</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>As the former approached the river, they saw <persName n="Greene,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00032" reg="mostcommon:Greene,nomatch:0"><surname>Greene</surname></persName>, wan and haggered, standing on the shore, and gazing anxiously up the road by which they were expected to appear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>His army was over, but he had remained behind to learn the fate of that noble guard, and, if necessary, to fly to its relief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>His eye lightened with exultation, as he saw the column rush forward to the river with shouts which were echoed in deafening accents from the opposite shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>It was now dark, and the troops were crowded with the utmost dispatch into the boats, and hastened over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>Scarcely were they safely landed, before the banks shook beneath the hurried heavy tramp of <orgName n="legion"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00033" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s legion</orgName>, as it came thundering on towards the ferry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>The next moment the shores rung with the clatter of armor, as those bold riders dismounted, and leaped into the boats ready to receive them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>Their horses were pushed into the water after them, and the black mass disappeared in the gloom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>In a few moments, lights dancing along the farther shore, told of their safe arrival, and a shout that made the welkin ring went up in the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> was the last man that embarked; he would not stir until his brave dragoons were all safe; and as the boat that bore him touched the shore, the tread of the <rs>British</rs> van echoed along the banks he had just left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>The pursuing columns closed rapidly in towards the river, but the prey they thought within their grasp had escaped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>Not a boat was left behind, and <persName><foreName>Cornwallis</foreName></persName> saw with the keenest anguish a deep broad river rolling between him and his foe. It was a bitter disappointment; his baggage had all been destroyed in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>And this terrible march of <measure n="250miles" type="distance">two hundred and fifty miles</measure> made only to be retraced. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/> But no pen can describe the joy and exultation that reigned in the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> camp that night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>The army received that gallant <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear-guard</orgName> with open arms, and hailed them as their deliverers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>Forgot was all &mdash; their lacerated feet, and stiffened limbs, and empty stomachs, and scanty clothing &mdash; and even the wintry wind swept by unheeded in the joy of their escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>Together the sat down and recounted their toiled, and asked, each of the other his perils and hardships by the way.--Laughter, and mirth, and songs, and all the reckless gaiety of a camp from which restraint is taken, made the shores echo.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>But it was with sterner pleasure <persName n="Greene,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00035" reg="mostcommon:Greene,nomatch:0"><surname>Greene</surname></persName> contemplated his escape; and as he looked on the majestic river, rolling in broad, deep current onward in the starlight a mountain seemed to lift from his heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>He listened to the boisterous mirth about him, only to rejoice that so many brave fellows had been snatched from the enemy, then turned to his tent to ponder on his position and resolve what next to do. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/> Thus ended this glorious retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/> A friend of this illustrious warrior, whose deeds are now resounding from <num value="1">one</num> end of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> to the other, has enabled us to give the following sketch of his life, previously to his acceptance of a command in the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>Since that time it has become a part of the history of the country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/> He was born in <placeName reg="Clarksburg, Harrison, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117793">Clarksburg</placeName>, in the county of <placeName reg="Lewis, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002271">Lewis</placeName>, in the year <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, of highly respectable parents, both of whom died during his infancy, leaving him without a cent in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>During his early childhood he resided with an uncle, whose name we did not hear and at the age of <num value="16">sixteen</num> he had conducted himself so well, and produced such a favorable impression of his energy and integrity that he was chosen constable of the county.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>In the year <dateStruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></dateStruct> a cadet had been appointed from his district to <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName>, who declined to go. <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00108" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,T.,J.,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> immediately conceived the idea of filling the place he had left vacant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>Our informant says, that <num value="1">one</num> day. while it was raining exceedingly hard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>he burst suddenly into his office, the rain streaming from his clothes, and told him that he must give him a letter to <persName n="Hayes,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00109" reg="mostcommon:Hayes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hayes</surname></persName>, at that time representative in Congress from the <rs>Lewis</rs> district.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>Upon being asked what he wanted with such a letter, he replied he wished to go to <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>His friend pointed out to him what he regarded as the absurdity of such a scheme, seeing that he was very deficient in education, and would, therefore, probably not be able to stand the preliminary examination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>He acknowledged the alleged deficiency, but said he was sure he had the perseverance to make it up. He obtained the letter without further difficulty, and that very evening borrowed a horse, under promise to send him back by a boy whom he carried with him, and rode to <placeName reg="Clarksburg, Harrison, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117793">Clarksburg</placeName> to take the stage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>It had been raining for weeks as it can only rain in that country, the roads were muddy as they are muddy nowhere else that ever we heard of <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00110" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,T.,J.,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> arrived in time; but on account of the muddy roads, the <rs>Postmaster</rs> had furnished the mail an hour before time, and the stage was already gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>With characteristic fidelity to his promise, <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00111" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,T.,J.,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> sent the horse back, instead of riding him on in pursuit of the stage, and took it on foot through the mud. After a run of <measure n="13miles" type="distance">thirteen miles</measure>, he overtook the stage, jumped in, went to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> all muddy as he was, presented his letter to <persName n="Hayes,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00112" reg="mostcommon:Hayes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hayes</surname></persName>, and was by him, intern, presented to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, who gave him the coveted warrant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>At <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> he severely felt the want of early education, but his indomitable spirit overcame every obstacle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>He was never marked for a demerit during his <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>, and graduated with the class of <dateStruct value="1846--"><year reg="1846">1846</year></dateStruct>, the same in which <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00113" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> graduated. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>At the siege of this latter place he commanded a battery, and attracted attention by his coolness and the judgment with which he worked his guns, and was promoted <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-1">First Lieutenant</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion he commanded a battery upon which the fire of the enemy was so severe that more than half his troops, who were raw, incontinently ran. <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00118" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,T.,J.,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> was advised to retreat; but he said if he could get a reinforcement of <num value="50">fifty</num> regulars, he would take the enemy's battery opposed to him, instead of abandoning his own. He sent for the named reinforcement, but, before it came, he had already stormed the obnoxious battery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/> <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s health was so much shattered by this campaign that he was compelled to resign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>In height, he is about <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure>, with a weight of about <num value="180">one hundred and eighty</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>He is quite as remarkable for his moral as he has proved himself to be for his fighting qualities &mdash; being a perfectly conscientious man, just in all his ways, and irreproachable in his dealings with his fellow men. It is said he is a fatalist, as <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00119" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> was, and has no fear that he can be killed before his time comes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>He is as calm in the midst of a hurricane of bullets as he was in the pew of his church at <placeName reg="Lexington, Lexington, Virginia" key="tgn,7013889">Lexington</placeName>, when he was professor of the <rs type="place">Institute</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>He appears to be a man of all most superhuman endurance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>Neither heat nor cold makes the slightest impression upon him. He cares nothing for good quarters and dainty fare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>Wrapped in his blanket, he throws himself down on the ground anywhere, and sleeps as soundly as though he were in a palace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>He lives as the soldiers live, and endures all the fatigue and all the suffering that they endure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>His vigilance is something marvelous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>He never seems to sleep, and lets nothing pass without his personal scrutiny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>He can neither be caught napping nor whipped when he is wide awake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>The rapidity of his marches is something portentous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>He is heard of by the enemy at <num value="1">one</num> point, and before they can make up their minds to follow him he is off at another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>His men have little baggage, and he moves, as nearly as he can, without encumbrance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>He keeps so constantly in motion that he never has a sick list, and no need of hospitals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>In these habits, and in a will as determined as that of <persName n="Julius,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00120" reg="mostcommon:Julius,nomatch:0"><surname>Julius</surname></persName> C&#x00E6;sar, are read the secret of his great success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>His men adore him, because he requires them to do nothing which he does not do himself, because he constantly leads them to victory, and because they see he is a great soldier. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/> At the last annual meeting of this body, resolutions were adopted that <q>&#x0022;appointment of colporteurs should be restricted to the army,&#x0022;</q> and that <q>&#x0022;special contributions to colportage among the soldiers should be solicited from such persons in all parts of the country as feel interested to the spiritual welfare of the brave men who are gathered from the various Southern States to fight our common battles on the soil of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.&#x0022;</q> --Acting under these instructions, the <orgName n="Sunday School and Publication Board" type="board">Sunday School and Publication Board</orgName> has made such an appeal, and with the most remarkable success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>Everywhere, from men of all denominations and of no denomination, a liberal response has been made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>The following is a brief summary of what has been effected, so far as it is needful to state result. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/> We have collected <measure n="24000dollars" type="currency">$24,000</measure>, with which <num value="40">forty</num> tracts have been published, <num value="6000000">six million</num> <num value="187000">one hundred and eighty seven thousand</num> pages of which have been distributed, besides <num value="6095">six thousand and ninety-five</num> Testaments, <num value="13845">thirteen thousand eight hundred and forty-five</num> copies of the little volume called <placeName reg="Camp Hymns">Camp Hymns</placeName>, and a large number of religious books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>Our policy has been to seek the cooperation of chaplains and other pious men in the army, and, as far as possible, to work through them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>Thus it is that a vast amount of labor has been performed without any expense to the <name>Board</name> and these scores of voluntary tract distributors, while carrying joy and peace to the hearts of their comrades, have themselves been greatly benefited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>By having something to do, they have realized the fulfilment of the promise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>In every such place some pious man has been found who, for the luxury of doing good to the soldiers, has been willing to furnish a suitable room and to act as our agent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/> Thus Testaments and tracts have been carried to the very doors of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of ministers and private Christians, who, but for these little depots of religious literature, might not have been induced to act as tract distributors.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/> When we entered upon these labors in the army, the field was entirely unoccupied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>No similar agency had been organized at that time and set at work in this direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>We had at least <num value="2">two</num>- <num value=".333">thirds</num> of all the colporteurs at the <rs>South</rs> in our employ &mdash; the result of our effort to build up a Southern colportage enterprise from the time when the <orgName n="American Tract Society" type="society">American Tract Society</orgName> determined to publish on the question of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>It seemed, therefore, that we, with this trained hand of laborers, were called of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> to engage in the work which had been brought to our very doors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>Appeals for tracts camp to us from chaplains and other pious men in the army, as well as from those at home, of all evangelical denominations; and at the same time contributions were made by Christians of different ecclesiastical connections, to aid in the publication and distribution of these tracts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>We were thus doubly encouraged to address a <hi rend="italics">general appeal</hi> to all good people within the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>While asking for the money of all, we have held ourselves ready to assist the labors of all among the soldiers, and such as wished our publications &mdash; chaplains, officers, <rs type="role" n="Private">privates</rs>, godly men and women at home &mdash; have been freely supplied with them. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/> From information since furnished, we are satisfied that the bad news published yesterday morning, regarding the retreat of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00317" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> was decidedly premature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>The fact that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> General had concentrated in force under apprehension of an attack, or had changed his position for some strategic move of his own, probably gave rise to the society-circulated rumor that he had fallen back from his line on the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>The report was written and handed in by a gentleman who was confident, by the general belief it obtained, that it was true; and it was regarded as disastrous news, as it destroyed the hope of an immediate battle, in which every <num value="1">one</num> feels certain that Southern arms must be victorious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>We are not aware to what extent the lines of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00318" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> have been changed, nor have we any news regarding the present position of his force, other than that in picket lines have been somewhat withdrawn. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/> In the excitement of the moment the writer of the above-mentioned paragraph also gave undue prominence to the movement by <persName n="Smith,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00319" reg="mostcommon:Smith,Francis,L.,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>, perhaps more than was attached to it by the actors themselves, and certainly more than the result of the affair would justify. </p>

<head>A &#x0022;Confidence Men&#x0022; in wheeling.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/> <num value="1">One</num> of the celebrated characters known as <q>&#x0022;Confidence Men&#x0022;</q> Seems to have visited wheeling, Va, within a few days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>The <hi rend="italics">Intelligencer,</hi> of that city, has the following account of his story and alleged attempted operations: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/> On <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> last a young man of fine address and very genteel in his appearance came to this city and called upon a tobacconist, representing himself as a suller, direct from <placeName reg="Pittsburg Landing, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2586587">Pittsburg Landing</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>He said he wanted to buy some wheeling stogles, for which he said he could get <measure n="5cents" type="currency">five cents</measure> apiece down <placeName reg="South River, Georgia, United States" key="tgn,2681709">South</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>He left an order at the establishment for about <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">five hundred dollars</measure> worth of goods, and went out with the promise to return and increase the order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>From the tobacco- house he went to a rag establishment, where he represented that he had <measure n="700dollars" type="currency">$700</measure> for <num value="1">one</num> of the girls employed in the house, which he had received from a soldier who was wounded at <placeName reg="Pittsburg Landing, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2586587">Pittsburg Landing</placeName>, and who afterwards died.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>He had for gotten the young woman's name, and seemed to be much disappointed in not recognizing her among the girls before him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/> Leaving this establishment he called upon <persName n="Barnes,Reverend,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00353" reg="mostcommon:Barnes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Reverend">the Rev. Mr.</roleName> <surname>Barnes</surname></persName>, of the <address><street n="4 Street">Fourth street</street></address> M. D. Church, who he told that his name was Collina, and that he was a son of the <rs>Hev Colling</rs> of the <orgName n="Baltimore Conference" type="conference">Baltimore Conference</orgName> of the <rs>M. E. Church</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>He said he had been imprisoned in the <rs>South</rs> for his Union sentiments, had just been released, and was on his way home to <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, and wanted to borrow <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">ten dollars</measure>. <persName n="Burnce,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00354" reg="mostcommon:Burnce,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr</roleName> <surname>Burnce</surname></persName> either suspected the fellow or did not feel disposed to lend money to strangers, and politely declined to grant the favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>The fellow then went to a prominent member of <persName n="Barnes,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00355" reg="mostcommon:Barnes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Barnes</surname></persName>'s Church, saying that <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> By had recommended him (the member) as a gentleman from whom he could likely obtain assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>To this latter gentleman <persName n="Collins,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00356" reg="mostcommon:Collins,nomatch:0"><surname>Collins</surname></persName> told about the same story that he had told <persName n="Barnes,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00357" reg="mostcommon:Barnes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Barnes</surname></persName>, with the addition that his sister was lying at the point of death in <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, and that every moment of delay seemed an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>He wanted to borrow <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">ten dollars</measure>, and would give a draft upon his brother, who was engaged in the <orgName n="Pension Office" type="office">Pension Office</orgName> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>The gentleman loaned the fellow the money upon these conditions, and he disappeared sometime during <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/> He is known in almost every city in the land, and is more familiar with the inside of jails than with the outside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>He is the same chap who used to write letters from <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>, <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> to the New York papers, after the breaking out of the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/> The <hi rend="italics">intelligencer</hi> adds that he was arrested and imprisoned in <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>, not for his Union sentiments, but on a different and more serious charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>In this connection it may be stated that a few days ago the <orgName n="Cincinnati Gazette" type="newspaper">Cincinnati <hi rend="italics">Gazette</hi></orgName> published a letter from <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>, written by a man calling himself <q>&#x0022;Collina,&#x0022;</q> in which he tells the following extraordinary story: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/> On the <date value="1861-04-10">10th of April, 1861,</date> I was arrested upon the allegation that I was a correspondent of the <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi> and thrown into a dark and loathsome dungeon, where the accumulated filth of years rendered existence for any length of time impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>This arrest the <hi rend="italics">Avalanches</hi> was exceedingly jubilant over, and had their counsels for summary execution been acted upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>I would not now be writing this letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>While confined in that city I was compelled to witness the enormities perpetrated in obedience to the behests of those who ruled the mob. <num value="1">One</num> hour in the morning, from <num value="6">6</num> to <num value="7">7</num>, was allowed me to stand at the window grate, and at such times their whippings and head- shavings were indulged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>Here I saw, from the <date value="04-27">27th of April</date> to the <date value="06-06">6th of June,</date> <num value="85">eighty five</num> men whipped and their heads shaved and <num value="43">forty-three</num> hung because they refused to take the oath of allegiance to the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>And on the <date value="05-19">19th of May</date> last, <num value="1">one</num> of the most beautiful and accomplished young ladies this country can beast of was stripped to the waist, <num value="13">thirteen</num> lashes laid upon her back, and the right half of her head shaved, simply because she had purchased a ticket for <placeName reg="Cairo Junction, Alexander, Illinois" key="tgn,7018995">Cairo</placeName>, and was congratulating herself that she would soon be in a land of freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>These crimes, which make the blood hurdle in our veins, <q>&#x0022;and rouse a vengeance blood alone can quell,&#x0022;</q> were regarded as small matters by the <hi rend="italics">Avalanche</hi>--altogether too insignificant to be noticed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/> [Doubtless the above story was fully credited in Protoplasm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>The incident illustrated the gullibility of the <rs>Northern</rs> press and public] </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
