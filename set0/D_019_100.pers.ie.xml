<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>He (a great nephew of the immortal <rs>Jenkins</rs>,) resigned his commission in the <rs>Federal Navy</rs>, assisted in extinguishing the flames kindled by the parricide <rs>Jenkins</rs>, and was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to plant our glorious <orgName n="Southern Banner" type="newspaper">Southern banner</orgName> where had before waved the now dishonored <orgName n="Stars and Stripes" type="newspaper">Stars and Stripes</orgName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> It is conceded on all hands that the <name>Ordinance</name> of Secession enacted by the <orgName n="Virginia Convention" type="convention">Virginia Convention</orgName> will be ratified by the people, and that by such a majority as was never before given in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> for any man or measure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The vote in the <rs>East</rs>, the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>, the <rs>Southwest</rs> and the <rs>Central West</rs> will be nearly unanimous.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> In view of the certainty that the <name>Ordinance</name> of Secession will be ratified, some persons in the <rs>Pan Handle</rs> are beginning to organize a rebellion against the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Citizens of more wisdom and loyalty will rather infer that a different course will become the people of the <rs>Pan Handle</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>They will not conspire to embarrass the noble old Commonwealth when she is pressed by her enemies. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>He and his supporters have villainously imposed upon the honesty of a large portion of our people by professing to pursue a course of peace toward the <rs>South</rs>, while at the same time he was preparing the engines of destruction which were to devastate the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>No people are more patriotic than ours; but when Black Republicanism looks for encouragement and support in its crusade against the <rs>South</rs>, it will look in vain in <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Northwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> The gallantry of <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName> is worthy of all praise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The following, from the <rs>Greenbrier Era</rs>, is another evidence of the spirit that animates the people of the mountains: </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The counties adjoining should at once organize volunteer companies, and follow in the footsteps of old <placeName reg="Greenbrier, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1124364">Greenbrier</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>Its form is similar to that of the ordinary shell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>The thickness of the shell is so arranged that whether it falls upon hard or soft earth, stone or wood, it bursts, and the contents fly in every direction, and in all shapes and quantities If it strikes wood, ignition instantly ensues; and if a human being, it passes down or through the body with the rapidity and effect of fighting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/> --A blockade is a high act of sovereign authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>Every belligerent has a right to blockade the ports of his enemy; but in order to render neutral vessels liable to the penalty which attaches to a breach of the blockade, there must be: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/> <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>An actual blockade imposed by competent authority. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/> <num value="3" type="ordinal">Third</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>A violation of the blockade. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/> A mere proclamation that a particular port is invested is sufficient to constitute a legal blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>For that purpose it is necessary that the place be invested by a competent naval force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>A blockade commences from the time a competent force is stationed to prevent communication. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/> There are <num value="2">two</num> kinds of blockade; <num value="1">one</num> by the simple fact only; the other by notification accompanied by the fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>In the former case, when the <hi rend="italics">fact</hi> ceases, (otherwise than by accident or the shifting of the wind,) there is immediately an end of the blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>But when the fact is accompanied by a public notification from the <rs>Government</rs> of a belligerent country to neutral Governments, <hi rend="italics">prima facie</hi> the blockade must be supposed to exist-till it has been publicly repealed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/> A blockade must be existing in point of fact, and to constitute that existence there must be power present to enforce it. The famous <rs>Berlin</rs> and <rs>Milan</rs> decrees and the <rs>British</rs> orders in council were held illegal because they assumed, in contravention of the clearest principles of public law, to impose the penalties of a breach of blockade where no <hi rend="italics">actual </hi> blockade existed; in other words, to create a blockade by proclamation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>The <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States Government</orgName> has uniformly insisted that a blockade should be made effective by the presence of a competent force, and have also protested against the application of the rights of seizure and confiscation to ineffectual or fictitious blockade. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/> A blockade having been established, the <hi rend="italics">ingress and egress</hi> of vessels are acts treated as breaches of it, for the destruction of the enemy's commerce is the very object of the blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>It is intended to suspend the entire commerce of the place, and a neutral is no more at liberty to assist the traffic of <hi rend="italics">exportation</hi> than of <hi rend="italics">importation.</hi> The utmost that can be allowed to a neutral is, that having taken in cargo before the blockade begins, she may be at liberty to retire with it. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/> The tremendous drama of startling history which the people of this country have been enacting for the last <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>, has no parallel in the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>A Confederacy enjoying a greater degree of prosperity than was ever witnessed before in any land, with increasing power, augmenting wealth, and a name distinguished and respected throughout the civilized world, is in a few short months overthrown and annihilated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>It is an incomprehensible fact to the intelligence of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and still an inaudible <num value="1">one</num> to a large portion of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> people, who persist in asserting that the <rs>Union</rs> still exists, and must be preserved by military power. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/> The causes which have led to this catastrophe will prove an instructive lesson to mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>The restless, turbulent, intolerant, and unprincipled spirit of Puritanical aggression, always malignant and fanatical, sowed the wind which has grown into a whirlwind, that has prostrated the <rs>Government</rs>, and is this moment sweeping irresistibly on to bloodshed and civil war. The great <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> for <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> constituted <num value="1">one</num> of the chief obstacles to the progress of this monstrous fanaticism; but this potential organization at last proved ineffectual for its resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>The <rs>North</rs> is alone and exclusively responsible for the great catastrophe and its consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>The men of the <rs>North</rs> have been the authors and the finishers of this monstrous crime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>Through their systematic perseverance the fountain heads of public sentiment at the <rs>North</rs> have been poisoned and polluted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>The schools, the pulpit, and the press, have been turned into engines of fanaticism, defamation and slander directed against the <rs>South</rs>, its institutions and people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>The Northern press, above all other appliances, has contributed most to the overthrow of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>It has been for many years festering in falsehood, and is at last laboring under an immedicable leprosy of lies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>The mind and sentiment of the <rs>North</rs> have been educated and trained to subsist upon this disgusting and poisonous aliment, just as the people of some countries fatten upon arsenic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>The footsteps of truth have marked no impression upon the <rs>North</rs> for the last <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of a century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>Their religion consists of a pharisaical propagandism of all fanatical conceits &mdash; of fine churches and adulterous parsons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>Their honesty and honor consist in keeping a balance to their credit on their bank-books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>The spirit of chivalry among them is only to be found in the bosoms of the &#x0022;fancy,&#x0022; and amid the haunts of the pugilists and Dead Rabbits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>They invent and build up, into immense proportions, such blasphemies as Mormonism with their revolting crimes, and rush in furious multitudes into the teachings and practice of free-love &mdash; They denounce the <rs>Government</rs> which they swore to support as <q>&#x0022;a league with death and a covenant with hell,&#x0022;</q> and with a yell like the doomed of Pandemonium, they unceasingly cry aloud for another <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and another revelation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/> To speak to such a people of the sacredness of a constitutional restriction, the binding efficacy of a solemn compact, is just the same as pouring into the ears of the <name>Hottentot</name> the mysteries and saving grace of the <rs>Christian</rs> plan of salvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>The faculties of mind to comprehend it are entirely wanting; as the fish of the waters of the <rs>Mammoth Cave</rs>, doomed to eternal night, are without eyes, so are these people from their perverted and vitiated training and education, without the faculty of virtue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>Money is their divinity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>Their benevolent institutions are often little better than dens of thieves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>They make merchandize of all that other people hold to be sacred; nor can they understand the uses of Government, except so far as it can be turned to purposes of rapine and plunder. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/> Independently of the disturbing question of <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slavery, the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States Government</orgName> could not have existed much longer under the rule and control of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>That question was fatal only because it seized upon the least robust part of the system, and thereby speedily manifested its weakness and decay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>It was the carbuncle which indicated the carrion condition of the system, and brought on the demise only a little more speedily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>The Northern man is incapable of self-government for any great length of time; because he is without honor and truth, and because he subordinates government, religion and everything else to his love of money, his lust for gain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>As long as the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> was in the hands of Southern men, prosperity, peace and purity reigned universally throughout the land.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/> <num value="1">1</num>. gives me pleasure to acknowledge the timely and important aid rendered me by the <rs>Governors</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> towards placing our fortifications on the seacoast in a defensible condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>I cheerfully reciprocated this favor to the extent of my ability, by sending to the <rs>Governor</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> a portion of the arms in our possession, and which could be conveniently spared. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/> The Northern Government is now concentrating a large force in the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>, ostensibly to protect the seat of Government, but such a force cannot be allowed to remain within the limits of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and on the borders of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, without seriously endangering the liberties of the people of those States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>If they be conquered and overrun, <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> will become the next prey to the invaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>Policy then, as well as sympathy and feeling of brotherhood, engendered by a common interest, requires us to exert our energies in the defence of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>Every battle fought there will be a battle fought in behalf of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, and there our troops should be speedily sent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/> There can be no doubt that the people of our State are now fully united as to the policy to be pursued with reference to the future Northern Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>It is a settled conviction of the public mind that the time has arrived when we must separate from the people of that section of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>They have drawn the sword against us, and are now seeking our blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>They have promised to partition our property and the earnings of our people among their mercenary soldiers, after our subjugation shall have been effected &mdash; Even those among them who professed to be our friends are now most zealous in this wicked crusade against us. All fraternity of feeling is lost between us and them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>There must be a separation, at once and forever. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/> With the view, therefore, of the secession of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> from the <rs>Northern Government</rs> and her Union with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, at as early a period as practicable, I would respectfully recommend that a Convention of the people be called with full and final powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>The powers of the <rs>Convention</rs> should be full, because the sovereignty of the people must be frequently resorted to during the war; and it therefore becomes necessary that it should be temporarily reposed in the <rs>Convention</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>The action of the <rs>Convention</rs> should be final, because of the importance of a speedy separation from the <rs>Northern Government</rs>, and the well known fact that upon this point our people are as a unit. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/> I cannot close this communication without congratulating you upon the harmony of feeling and the union of purpose now existing among the people in every part of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>No sooner was it seen that our liberties were menaced by the usurper, than all party feuds were forgotten, and the patriotic fires that burned in the bosoms of our ancestors were rekindled in the breasts of their descendants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>The hearts of the people everywhere are prepared for the contest before us. Let us fervently implore Almighty <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, that united counsels and an harmony of purpose may prevail among us, that we may be enabled to preserve the blessings of liberty that we have inherited from our fathers. </p> </div3>
