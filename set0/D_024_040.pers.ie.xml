<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>I told him I had not been in this business long, and did not know exactly how to answer, but wished him to name the sum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>He answered &#x0022;a vote;&#x0022; and that it would be very troublesome to get the men away, and, beside, he only regarded the money paid as the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instalment and that he felt in duty bound to take care of the person that made him <rs type="role2">Senator</rs> afterward and if he had so many to take care of it would embarrass him; but, if he had but <num value="1">one</num>, he could do it well and profitably as long as we lived; and said, beside, there would be no more danger in voting directly for him than in being absent, for they would make every provision for the protection of the men that would vote for him. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>Their manner of proceeding, it seems, it to be as distinguished for wisdom as it has already been for unanimity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>They send delegates &mdash; what they want with delegates, when they have already settled matters without them, we do not know &mdash; they send delegates &mdash; not to any point within their own borders &mdash; but of all other places upon earth, to <placeName reg="Frankfort, Franklin, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013939">Frankfort</placeName>, where bodies of troops are already superintending the proceedings of the <rs>Kentucky Legislature</rs>, and where legislative committees deliberate with sentinels at the door of the committee room &mdash; These delegates, from this very safe and convenient point of assemblage, are to send other delegates to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, having <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> ascertained, of course, that the way is safe, the coast clear, and that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> soldiers and officers will open their ranks and let them pass, whether they possess passports from the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities or not. The physic, it seems, is already working.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>Out of <orgName n="army"><persName n="McClernand,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00245" reg="mostcommon:McClernand,nomatch:0"><surname>McClernand</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> of <num value="150000">150,000</num>, all have deserted but <num value="40000">40,000</num>--the biggest desertion of modern times, except in a few cases where a whole army have gone over, as the <name>Saxons</name> at <placeName key="tgn,7012329" n="1.000 1" reg="leipzig,leipzig,sachsen,deutschland,europe">Leipsic</placeName> &mdash; and <num value="110000">110,000</num> late Union soldiers are struck at a single blow, without firing a shot or drawing a sword, from the best of the <rs>Union</rs> army!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>Well might the telegraph call these marvels &#x0022;important, if true!&#x0022;--We wonder at its moderation in thus designating them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>Even the concurrent announcement that <persName n="McClernand,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00246" reg="mostcommon:McClernand,nomatch:0"><surname>McClernand</surname></persName> &mdash; after the loss of his <num value="110000">110,000</num> deserters &mdash; is still stirring heaven and earth to take <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, does not add to the astounding character of the tidings! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/> To the credit of this community, be it said we have not met with a man who placed the slightest confidence in this bald, disjointed, palpable humbug, the author of which appears to be a mere apprentice to the trade of lying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>The very extravagance of the statements deprived them of all power to deceive by removing all possibility of belief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>Yet had there been the least shadow of probability attached to them, they were calculated to produce infinite harm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>The public is predisposed to attach too much credit to the reports which we constantly hear from the <rs>Northwest</rs>, and while we are threatened by a host almost rivalling that of Xarxes, to look for safety in the divisions and distractions of our enemies, instead of expecting it from the only source from which it can possibly come, namely: from the valor and constancy of the men who are upholding our banner in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>That there is discord in the councils as well as in the ranks of the enemy, we have every reason to believe; yet not more than a single victory on a large scale, and of a decided character, would instantly have; not more than the assurance of the conquest and spoliation of the <rs>South</rs> would convert into perfect unanimity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>If parties quarrel in the <rs>North</rs>, it is because their armies are unsuccessful in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>If <num value="1">one</num> of these parties speaks out loudly for peace, it is became it sees no profit likely to arise from the prosecution of the war. Let them but have a few decisive victories in the <rs>South</rs>, and we shall soon find our cause in a miserable minority in the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>In the meantime, we believe this constant delusion to be hurtful to our cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>We believe, indeed, nothing could be more so. It raises hopes that are destined to be extinguished as fast as they are raised, and the disappointment of hope is worse than not entertaining hope in the beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>It is a condition of mind the worst possible for recruiting our armies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/> Let us not be understood as impugning the policy of widening every breach which may occur between parties in the enemy's country by every means possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>It would clearly be folly in us not to take every advantage that presents itself to us. But let us not depend upon that resource as the means of conquering our independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>That must be done at the point of the bayonet and the mouth of the cannon, and that fact ought always to be kept in view.
