<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>The leading topic of street conversation since <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> has been the prospect for the <hi rend="italics">fact</hi> of a recognition of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> by <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>We do not know that any official assurance to this effect has been received by the authorities, but a report of this nature is in general circulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>We refer our readers to the copious extracts from <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> journals, which, it will be seen, plainly foreshadow a probable demonstration. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/> When the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Sempronius,Consul,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00151" reg="mostcommon:Sempronius,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Consul">Consul</roleName> <surname>Sempronius</surname></persName>,</hi> was defeated, with the loss of half-his army at the <name>Trebia</name>, he retired to a strong town, many miles distant, with the remnant, and sent a dispatch to the <name>Senate</name>, in which he concealed his defeat, and represented himself as having fallen back to the point he then occupied merely for convenience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>This tale was believed in <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>, until stragglers began to arrive from the army, and the truth began to leak out.--The alarm, when the facts became known, surpassed all conception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>The very attempt at concealment gave a terrible impulse to the panic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>Men believed that the defeat was even more complete than it actually was. The Senate saw the evil effect produced upon the public mind by the lying message of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Sempronius,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00152" reg="mostcommon:Sempronius,nomatch:0"><surname>Sempronius</surname></persName>,</hi> and they determined to profit by it. Accordingly, a few months after, when news arrived of the terrible catastrophe of Thrasymene, the <rs>Consul</rs> assembled the people and began an address by saying, <q>&#x0022;we have lost a great battle; the whole army has been cut to pieces; the <rs>Consul</rs> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Flaminius,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00153" reg="mostcommon:Flaminius,nomatch:0"><surname>Flaminius</surname></persName></hi> is among the slain.&#x0022;</q> It was a terrible shock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>Terror and dismay at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> pervaded all ranks, but they had heard the worst, and they let themselves to work at once to repair the evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>It was far better to let them know the whole truth at once than to suffer them to discover it only by accident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>It inspired them with confidence when they found the <name>Senate</name> concealing nothing from them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Fremont,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00154" reg="mostcommon:Fremont,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Fremont</surname></persName></hi> does not appear to have profited by the lesson conveyed in these <num value="2">two</num> memorable examples.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>He made the most extraordinary efforts to conceal the terrible catastrophe which has overtaken the <rs>Federal</rs> arms in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>He telegraphed to all quarters of Yankeedom, that the <name>Federalists</name> had obtained a signal triumph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>And yet, in spite of all his efforts at concealment, he was compelled to let the truth slip out. He knew that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> mind would not rest satisfied with mere generalities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>He was chliged to descend to details' and in those details appeared results which it was impossible to reconcile with the idea of Federal success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>The Rebels, he said, had <num value="23000">23,000</num> men, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> but <num value="8600">8,600</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> inflicted a terrible defeat upon the rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>They stormed their batteries; took their cannon, burnt their tents, and then <hi rend="italics">retreated</hi> <measure n="30miles" type="distance">thirty miles</measure>--the conquered rebels, of course, pursuing them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>In consequence of this great victory of his own friends, he found it necessary to declare martial law, to reconstruct a disbanded regiment, to appeal to the loyalty of the <name>Federalists</name> living in <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName>, to cry with agonizing emphasis upon <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> and <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName> for help.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>The very <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> could not be deceived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>They must have felt that if such were the consequences of victory, there could be little difference between it and defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>Their papers show that they saw through the thin disguise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>Would it not have been better to have acted as the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> Consul did when the news of Thrasymene arrived?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>Would it not have been better to have told the whole truth at once?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>Is it not of advantage to a Government to possess the confidence of its people?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>And how can such confidence exist if the people never know when to believe what their rulers tell them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>The truth could not possibly be concealed a very long time, and when it came at last, it must act upon the public mind with all the force of buoyant hope suddenly converted into the phrenzy of unredeemed despair. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/> Enough of this, however.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>It will be seen, by reference to another column, that <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lyon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00155" reg="mostcommon:Lyon,Gen,,,:1"><surname>Lyon</surname></persName>'s</hi> force has been routed beyond the hope of recovery &mdash; that he himself has been killed &mdash; that between <num value="3">three</num> and <num value="4000">four thousand</num> of his men have been made to bite the dust &mdash; that the rest, at the last accounts, were flying before a large body of cavalry, with the prospect before them of being cut off and captured &mdash; that he lost vast quantities of arms, ammunition and baggage, besides several field pieces and a large number of wagons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>The real business of war has begun, and men have already forgotten the phase of speech-making and flag-waving, of calls for universal sympathy, and anger at not obtaining it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>When an army enters a hostile territory to conquer its defenders and coerce its inhabitants, it is impossible to desire the success of the invaders without desiring the defeat of the invaded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>Now, we having no quarrel with the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, did not think it our duty to cheer on their enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>Since the meeting of Congress the bills for the financial support of the war have been the chief subjects of discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>In the <orgName n="House of Commons" type="government">House of Commons</orgName>, on the <date value="07-29">29th of July,</date> <persName n="Gregory,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00231" reg="mostcommon:Gregory,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gregory</surname></persName>, who may be considered the agent of the rebels in the <orgName n="British Parliament" type="parliament">British Parliament</orgName>, asked whether the <rs>Government</rs> had received any information to the effect that goods contraband of war, including a battery of artillery, had been conveyed from <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName> to New York in the <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Kangaroo</rs>, and that a loan for the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>If so, was this in accordance with <name>British</name> principles of nonintervention?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>The reply of <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Palmerston</foreName></persName> was distinguished by a studied ambiguity, which, however, is capable of a somewhat definite interpretation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>He said that he was not personally cognizant of the matters referred to, but that, should they arise, they would of course be dealt with by the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>There would be less doubt of the exact meaning of the words of <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Palmerston</foreName></persName>'s reply if the goods contraband of war had not been associated with the loan in the question asked by <persName n="Gregory,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00232" reg="mostcommon:Gregory,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gregory</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>But, not withstanding, it is obvious that he meant as soon as the loan was opened on the <rs>London Stock Exchange</rs> the <rs>Government</rs> would interfere to prevent its negotiation, as an infringement of <name>British</name> neutrality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>Were it not so, the reply would have been couched in very different terms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/> This, therefore, plainly shows the real sentiments of the <rs>British Government</rs> towards this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>When we warned the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> public of the secret hostility of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 12" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and of her desire to promote the cause of the rebels, and even elevate the insurgent States to the dignity of an independent nationality, we were assailed by nearly the whole press of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 12" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> for what was said to be our wilful misrepresentation of a friendly Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>Does not this <num value="1">one</num> act alone show that we were right in our estimate of the character of the <rs>British Cabinet</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>Even the newspapers that formerly veiled their own and the <rs>Government</rs> hostility to us now come out boldly and proclaim it. Not the slightest encouragement, we are told by <num value="1">one</num> <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> journal, should be given to the negotiation of an <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> loan in that market, and although endeavors may be made to raise the money, it is not believed they will be successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>We trust that the <rs>British</rs> public will offer no encouragement, even to the most speculative money broker, to embark in such an enterprise, says another journal, and the most decided ill will is manifested in the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>If this is friendship, what is hostility?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>Hitherto the <rs>London</rs> money market has been opened to all the world &mdash; to establish alike with revolutionary governments &mdash; and the negotiation of loans has proceeded without restriction.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>The doctrine of secession is <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> instance in which <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> (and the <rs>North</rs> too, in this case) holds views contrary to <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs>, though not to <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs>, ideas of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>Here, again, if we would purane truth and arrive at correct conclusions, <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> political questions must be judged by <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>As every <num value="1">one</num> knows, those principles were laid down <num value="3">three</num>-quarters of a century ago, in the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>, and every year since that period this famous statement of rights has been read in every city, town, and village of the <rs>Union</rs>; and it has been proclaimed to the whole world amid the firing of guns, pistols, &#x0026;c, that <q>&#x0022;we hold these truths to be self-evident &mdash; that all government is derived from the consent of the governed, and that this right is inalienable.&#x0022;</q>All this was fought for and secured. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/> Let us examine the case as well as we are </p> <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/> able. <num value="9000000">Nine millions</num> of people demand, for some cause or other, the right, so clearly announced, and once fought for, of governing themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>It is denied; but the diversity and weakness of the reasons for the denial afford clear proofs of the perplexity of a people conscious of doing a dishonest thing.--<num value="1">One</num> great statesman, for instance, wishing to drink at the same moment <q>&#x0022;at the fountain and mouth of the <placeName reg="Lyre River, Clallam, Washington" key="tgn,2477520">Nile</placeName>,&#x0022;</q> asks how the <rs>North</rs> can give up the <placeName reg="Gulf of Mexico" key="tgn,7021009">Gulf of Mexico</placeName> to a foreign Power?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>He would have the great lakes of the <rs>North</rs> and the great <rs>Gulf</rs> of the <rs>South</rs>; and why not the <rs>St. Lawrence</rs> and <rs n="Amazon" type="ethnic">Amazon</rs> as well?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>This is that selfish view of the case, which supposes that all other nations are forever to be penned up in their present limits, while the <name>States</name> are to spread over and own illimitable territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>Another urges as a reason for war, the <q>&#x0022;stolen&#x0022;</q> forts, &#x0026;c; forgetting that the <rs>North</rs> retains, in forts, custom-houses, mints, and other public buildings, property of perhaps <num value="10">ten</num> times the value of that taken by the <rs>South</rs> on its own soil, to say nothing of the whole <orgName n="U. S. Navy" type="org">United States navy</orgName>, now turned against those who have helped to build it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/> Another cites the firing of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gun by the <rs>South</rs>, forgetting that <sic>that</sic> gun was not fired until an armed squadron left <placeName reg="New York harbor">New York harbor</placeName>, after <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00233" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s express declaration that he would collect the revenue in the <rs>South</rs> and retake the forts, arsenals, &#x0026;c. A man does not usually wait until the blow descends, if he sees his enemy approaching him with raised bludgeon; the approach <sic>constistitutes</sic> the attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>Besides, if the <rs>South</rs> were in earnest in secession, it would have been folly to wait until the whole navy had arrived from the <rs>Pacific</rs> and the <rs>East</rs> to throttle them at their doors. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/> Another statesman seems only desirous of showing <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> how strong a Government republicanism may have, and that it is no failure; forgetting that the exercise of that power in such a way is simply despotism, and proves the failure, and that a war for <hi rend="italics">Union</hi> implies in itself <hi rend="italics">disunion.</hi> * * * </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/> But we pass by all this to consider the point most strongly urged by the <rs>President</rs>, namely, as to what would happen if the doctrine of Secession were acknowledged as a right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>We answer, just that would happen which would happen by acknowledging the right of self-government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>The last logically implies the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>An attempt is made to evade this in the <rs>North</rs> by saying that they acknowledge the right of revolution, which is an absurdity, as a Government cannot allow or acknowledge what it forbids; besides, if the revolution be overcome, then the conquered--<num value="1">one</num> or <num value="20000000">twenty millions</num>, as the case may be &mdash; are immediately denied the right of self-government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>Thus we arrive at the same conclusion; and the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States Government</orgName>, in attempting coercion, have clearly abandoned their own principles. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/> Indeed, we might say that certain Northern States were the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> seceders, since many of them enacted laws making obedience to <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> laws a penal offence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>This was partial secession; and it might have been supposed that the whole <rs>North</rs> would have been the party desiring to secede from the <rs>South</rs>, since they have so long urged their desire to be <q>&#x0022;disconnected from the guilt of slavery,&#x0022;</q> and the doctrine of self-government and secession would have allowed them to obey these dictates of conscience without bloodshed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/> But <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00234" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> also aims to protect, as he terms them, <q>&#x0022;the majority of Union men&#x0022;</q> in the <rs>South</rs>--a solicitude which reminds us strongly of that displayed by the <rs>Emperor</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName> towards the non-Magyar population in <placeName key="tgn,7006278" n="1.000 27" reg="magyarorszag">Hungary</placeName>, except that in the latter case there is such a population; but in the former there is not to be found in the <rs>South</rs> anything that could ever be termed a small minority of Union men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/> In fact, this abandonment of the fundamental idea, on the part of the <rs>North</rs>, upon which the whole Government was founded, has thrown the ruling powers into inextricable confusion, and given rise to all those anomalies which so much surprise <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>They term those who correspond precisely with their heroic ancestors <q>&#x0022;rebels.&#x0022;</q> They call those <q>&#x0022;pirates&#x0022;</q> who are carrying out a mode of warfare insisted upon by themselves so late as <date value="1857">1857.</date> They are doing to their own ports in blockading them what they only lately declared the <rs n="Sicilian" type="ethnic">Sicilians</rs> had no right to do. They appeal to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> for countenance as of a free Power against a slave, and yet declare that they intend to perpetuate that slavery according to the constitution. * * </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/> In whatever light we view the case, the position of the <rs>North</rs> is most unfortunate.--If, after a fearful expenditure of life and money, they succeed in subjugating the <rs>South</rs>, it will still require an immense army to hold them in subjection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>If, on the other hand, the <rs>Union</rs> be patched up again, Abolitionists and others will immediately commence their agitation, and there will be, in a short period, a re-enactment of all the present troubles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>But if, in the third place, the <rs>South</rs> is successful in her resistance, of which we have no doubt, the <rs>North</rs> will have expended her blood and treasure merely for the sake of creating a hating and hated rival. </p> </div4> </div3>
