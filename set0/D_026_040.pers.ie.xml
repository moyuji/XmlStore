<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>No war of any magnitude had ever been prosecuted any where before this <num value="1">one</num> without throwing to the surface men of marked military genius and marked public virtue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>But this war has been fruitful of no such result so far. Those who had inspired a momentary confidence had disappointed the public expectations.--We have had some splendid fighting, but with no marked results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>Our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> seem to have no ability to reap the fruits of well-fought battles. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/> To fight the enemy, to gain a decisive victory, and then let him escape with his men, guns, and baggage, is simply to make the war endless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>He considered the <rs>President</rs>'s amnesty proclamation as impracticable, in consequence of the large number of persons exempted from the hope of pardon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>These would be made desperate and fight to the last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>If the large number exempted from pardon were in the hands of the <rs>President</rs> to-day, and under lock and key, so that he could, if he would, march them out to death, he could not execute that large number. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>He not only expected it, but had never seen any explanation or reason why it was not done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>Confident of that result he sent to the <rs>President</rs> a plan for the settlement of the difficulty <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>.

<head>Disloyal men.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> journals speak with great confidence of sympathizers in various portions of the <rs>South</rs>, who never fall to render all possible assistance to <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisoners in escaping from captivity, who groan under the &#x0022;intolerable military despotism&#x0022; of the <rs>South</rs>, and who pine for the time when &#x0022;the glorious old flag,&#x0022; symbol of &#x0022;the most mild and merciful Government under the sun,&#x0022; shall wave over the citadel of the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>That there are such persons we do not deny, though it is equally true that they are few in number; that they assist in the escape of prisoners is not to be doubted; that they correspond and conspire with the enemy for the destruction of our Government and people is highly probable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>What abyss of baseness human treachery can descend to has been exhibited in more than <num value="1">one</num> case of treason by wretches living in the <rs>South</rs> that may well defy a parallel in the history of crime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>The very fact that traitors are not numerous in the <rs>South</rs> has led to the indifference with which their conduct has been regarded, and the complete impunity with which they have been permitted to carry on their traitorous designs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/> The benignity and toleration manifested by this Government to persons who, if living in the <rs>North</rs> and exhibiting the attitude toward that Government which they do to this, would ensure their consignment to a dungeon, has only tended to make them more bitter, treacherous, and malignant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>They affect to regard as a cruel despotism a Government which does not interfere with their freedom of speech and person, and which permits them to enjoy all the rights of loyal citizens and the possession of their ill-gotten gains, whilst curses for the <rs>Southern</rs> cause and all connected with it are the only coin which they pay for such clemency and indulgence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>If the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were to come here to-morrow the worst enemies of the loyal people, the most cruel and savage persecutors of our cause and countrymen, would be these domestic traitors, who are unmolested in person, estate, or liberty by our people and our Government. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/> But the time has come when the truth that those who are not for us are against us, must be practically recognized, and that pitiful minority of men and women who do not regard this as their country, must be sent to that country which they do regard as such, and not permitted to remain here, to assist <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisoners to escape and plot treason against the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>It is the custom of the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs> to send from its own limits better people than themselves for not half their offences.
