<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>There is no change in the general situation of affairs at the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The sharpshooters on both sides continue their practice, and at interval is the scene is varied by the bursting of a shell thrown over among the enemy's working parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>For this purpose howitzers are mostly used, and are found to answer very well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The shells drop with considerable accuracy inside of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> fortifications, and must to some extent interfere with their digging operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The troops of <orgName n="command"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitz,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s command</orgName> are in fine health and spirits, and enjoying abundant rations, including sugar and coffee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> bill of fare is said to be nothing but hard tack and coffee, their supply of meat having been exhausted. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>He takes care to have his front well propelled, and his works are said to be of the most formidable character. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> It will be seen from the telegraphic summary of Northern news that on <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> newspaper has the honesty to acknowledge that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> has been whipped in front of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>He is strongly fortified, and is at work night and day strengthening his front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>His lines are not more than <hi rend="italics"><measure n="40yards" type="distance">forty yards</measure></hi> from ours in some places, and on <num value="2">two</num> points of the lines are the <num value="2">two</num> armies more than <measure n="100yards" type="distance">one hundred yards</measure> than each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The artillery is occasionally brought into play, but the sharpshooting is incessant and quite destructive, we being not less than <num value="40">forty</num> per day in this way. A man dare not show his head above the works, or even at any loop hole in them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>If he does he is sure to be picked off like the gallant <persName n="Slade,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Slade,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Slade</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="16MSRegiment">16th Mississippi regiment</orgName>, who a day or <num value="2">two</num> since had just gotten from a recumbent position for a <unclear></unclear> in order to fix a shade over his works, when in an infant his head was pierced by a ball and he fell dead. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>This news was communicated by the telegraph operator at the next nearest station, and, though not confirmed by official dispatches, was generally credited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>That a light took place on Saturday is evident from the fact that a private dispatch was received from <num value="1">one</num> of <persName n="Lee,General,Fitz,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="default:Lee,Fitz,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <foreName>Fitz</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s staff, stating that an engagement was going on with favorable prospects, and that our men were well and in good spirits. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>Let him stay, for fear of a successor who might not be quite such an imbecile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>So we say of Old Abe.--It would be impossible to find another such <sic>ass</sic> in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and therefore we say let him stay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>We, at least of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, ought to be satisfied with him, for he has conducted the war exactly as we ought to wish it to be conducted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>He has confirmed those that were wavering, heated red hot those who were luke warms made those zealous who were careless, converted cold indifference into furious passion, and calculating neutrality into burning patriotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>As for the military operations conceived and executed under his auspices, surely we have no right to complain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>No service ever had so many blundering officers, and no campaigns were ever conducted with greater stupidity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>For these reasons, we are decidedly in favor of Old Abe, and if we could command a <num value="1000000">million</num> of votes in Yankeedom he should have them all.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/> A city contemporary not only agrees with us, that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00290" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s force has been greatly overrated, but from documents in his possession and published in part by him, places it even lower than we have ventured to do. He thinks he can barely muster <num value="90000">90,000</num> men, infantry, artillery and cavalry, allowing his regiments <num value="500">500</num> men each, which he thinks, and which we think, excessive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>We are very much inclined to believe he is nearer the truth than we were, and we thought as much at the time we wrote our article, but concluded it would be best to err on the safe side. --We allowed him <num value="115000">115,000</num> men of all arms, estimating his army when it commenced its march at <num value="130000">130,000</num>, rating his losses at <num value="100000">100,000</num>, and giving him credit, upon the statements of <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00291" reg="mostcommon:Stanton,nomatch:0"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName>, the <rs>Northern</rs> press, and the prisoners captured by our troops, for reinforcements to the extent of <num value="85000">85,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>But we do not believe he had <num value="130000">130,000</num> in the beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>Our correspondent &#x0022;Sallust,&#x0022; who is rarely far in the wrong, estimated his infantry before any battle had been fought at <num value="92000">92,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>Allow him, however, <num value="15000">15,000</num> cavalry and <num value="5000">5,000</num> artillery, and we make his force at starting <num value="112000">112,000</num> men. Of these, according to our calculation, he has lost <num value="100000">100,000</num> men. But his losses have been supplied to a great extent as fast as they occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>His <num value="85000">85,000</num> reinforcements, would bring his army up to <num value="97000">97,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>But has he received reinforcements to that extent?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>We have the word of <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00293" reg="mostcommon:Stanton,nomatch:0"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName> &mdash; the greatest liar in Christendom &mdash; that he sent him <num value="25000">25,000</num> veterans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>That statement was published a fortnight ago, while he was still in <placeName reg="Hanover, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2112147">Hanover</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>We have the word of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisoners that <num value="40000">40,000</num> had reached him from <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>That statement is far from being as worthy of credit as the gospel. --We have the statement of a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> correspondent, that <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00294" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName> had sent him <num value="30000">30,000</num>. --That we set down as extremely doubtful.--Lastly, we have the statement of <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00295" reg="mostcommon:Stanton,nomatch:0"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName>, that <persName n="Cesnols,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00296" reg="mostcommon:Cesnols,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Cesnols</surname></persName>, at the head of <num value="5000">5,000</num>, had reached him, about the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of this month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>Such has been the <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> skill with which his operations have been conducted that he has always compelled his enemy to attack him behind his breastworks, whence his men inflicted the most enormous loss, without sustaining anything like an equivalent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>In this campaign the casualties of the enemy, as contrasted with ours, have certainly not been loss than <num value="5">five</num> to <num value="1">one</num>--<persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00299" reg="mostcommon:Stanton,nomatch:0"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName> telegraphs that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00300" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> only lost <num value="7500">7,500</num> men in the battle around <placeName reg="Cold Harbor">Cold Harbor</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>The figures ought to be multiplied, we have no doubt, by at least <num value="3">three</num>; but, allowing them to be correct, what a disparity is presented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>After that he fell back, covered his retreat by the <name>Cos</name>, and leisurely entered the lines which he had been fortifying for a year to cover <placeName reg="Lisboa, Distrito de Lisboa, Portugal" key="tgn,7010978">Lisbon</placeName>, and which have become famous over the whole civilized world as the lines of Torres Vedras.--His force behind these lines amounted to <num value="55000">55,000</num> splendid troops, English and Portuguese, assisted by <num value="40000">40,000</num> militia.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>The lines themselves, <num value="3">three</num> in number, presented the most tremendous system of fortifications of which there is any account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>They extended from the <rs>Tagus</rs> on <num value="1">one</num> side, to the ocean on the other, <placeName reg="Lisboa, Distrito de Lisboa, Portugal" key="tgn,7010978">Lisbon</placeName>, which is on the river near its month, being in their rear and entirely surrounded by them, and itself strongly fortified, while an enormous fleet of transports, men of war, and merchant vessels, all <persName n="English,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00305" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>, lay in the harbor and kept the <name>Anglo</name>-Portuguese army constantly supplied with provisions, recruits, and all the munitions and appliances of war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>In the meantime <rs>Massena</rs> advanced through a country which the policy of his adversary and the zeal of the inhabitants had converted into a desert.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>Every horse, every cow, every sheep, every goat, every particle of provision, every bit of grain, had been either removed or destroyed, and as the <rs>French</rs> had depended on their favorite system of making war support war &mdash; that is, if living on the country &mdash; they had neglected to bring their supplies with them, and soon began to be pinched by hunger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>True, they were partially supplied from beyond the frontier; but the way was long and rugged, the guerillas swarmed around the convoys, and the supply was to the last degree precarious.
