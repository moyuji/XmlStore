<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> The road from <placeName reg="Manassas, Manassas, Virginia" key="tgn,2112877">Manassas Junction</placeName> to <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName> and <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> is through a tract of country abounding in beautiful scenery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The succession of hill and valley; of cultivated farms and patches of woodland; of pasture land and meadows, makes it delightful to travel through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Near <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> the land is quite level, but immediately beyond it is rolling and broken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Still farther on the hills grow larger and steeper, until they run into a chain of continued hills that lie opposite the cities of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and <placeName reg="Georgetown, Washington, District of Columbia" key="tgn,7015724">Georgetown</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> Taking the <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName> road, <num value="1">one</num> soon comes to the site of the battle of the <num value="18" type="ordinal">18th</num> near <placeName reg="Blackburn's Ford">Blackburn's Ford</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>On the <rs>Manassas</rs> side there is a broad meadow and a long line of intervale land, but across the <rs type="place">Run</rs> there is a steep cliff covered with a dense pine thicket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>It was here that the <orgName n="Washington Artillery" type="artillery">Washington Artillery</orgName> did such good service on the <dateStruct value="--18"><day reg="2">18th</day></dateStruct>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> There are few signs of the battle left to attract notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The graves of the <name>Federalists</name> are visible still; but everything in the shape of balls, broken guns, cartridge boxes, haversacks, <hi rend="italics">et cetera,</hi> have been removed as relics by curiosity hunters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>A great many canes have been cut from the spot and even the stones have been carried away. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> A short distance beyond the thicket is a small house, near which the <rs>Federals</rs> planted their large gun on the morning of the <num value="21" type="ordinal">21st</num> and commenced firing on our centre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The battery was stationed partially behind the house and in an excellent position to rake the thicket where our men might be hidden.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>As is now well known, this firing was but a feint to cover the main design on the left; but <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Generals</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> and <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> were too sagacious and too skillful in their profession to be caught by it. The landscape, as seen from this hill, is very picturesque, and there is many a delicious bit that would furnish material for an artist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>When this war is over, and the events now transpiring have become matters of history, this spot will attract <num value="1000">thousands</num> of visitors, and I have little doubt will become a place of popular resort during the summer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> On our way to <placeName reg="Fairfax, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,7014159">Fairfax</placeName>, we called on <persName n="Toombs,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Toombs,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Toombs</surname></persName>, who now commands a brigade of the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>He was seated in front of his tent, busily engaged in a military work, and did not at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> notice our approach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>His encampment is near headquarters, and situated upon a gentle slope towards the road, and is completely surrounded by forest-crowned hills.--Located in a deep vale, with his trusty soldiers around him, this famous man is now busily engaged in studying the art of war, and in perfecting himself in the profession he has so recently adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Eminent in everything he has yet attempted, I have no doubt he will distinguish himself in this war, and will come out of it with as great reputation for military skill as he has always maintained in every walk of civil life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>At our approach he greeted us kindly, and for an hour we were much interested in his conversation upon the present state of affairs and of the future prospect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>It was with regret that we quitted his hospitable quarters, and pressed forward to <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> On the way were several camps, in some of which we stopped and passed a few moments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The men, generally, are in very good health, cheerful, and in fine spirits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Contentment marks every camp I have yet been in, and thus far I have not heard a single word of complaint at any hardship, or at any occasional privation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The love of the men for <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> is very remarkable, and the bare mention of his name causes a feeling of enthusiasm and pride that is clearly seen on every countenance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/><persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> is very much respected, but as yet is not as well known as <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The soldiers have unbounded confidence in his ability and bravery, and speak of him in a very flattering manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>With <num value="2">two</num> such <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> as these, and with the brave hearts and strong arms of the men, who can doubt the success of every battle, unless the odds are greater than at the battle of <placeName key="tgn,2070420" n="1.000 3" reg="marathon, cortland, new york">Marathon</placeName>? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> I wrote you yesterday from <persName n="Fairfax,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Fairfax,John,,,:1"><surname>Fairfax</surname></persName>, and gave an account of the small fight near <placeName reg="Somersworth, Strafford, New Hampshire" key="tgn,2063800">Great Falls</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Since that time no reliable news has come in of any skirmishes, or of any firing, beyond that of the pickets, who keep up a continual fire upon each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The many rumors of a general fight which I see have gained credence in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> are entirely untrue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Nothing can be learned from the passengers on the <rs>Manassas</rs> train, for they report the most extravagant lies with great prodigality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>They do not willfully intend to deceive, but, of course, circulate such stories as are told to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/> Women with sour tempers and sharp tongues are grievous afflictions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>Of all the evils under the sun, that calamity in the form of a turbulent and contentious woman is the severest trial of temper and the greatest foe to happiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/><persName n="Meek,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00049" reg="mostcommon:Meek,nomatch:0"><surname>Meek</surname></persName> submission to many painful dispensations moderates their force, and resignation is rewarded by numerous considerations that at once soothe and strengthen, but the brawling of a shrew deriving encouragement from patient endurance and long suffering, causes the tireless little member to move to faster, and to draw out the full capacity of the shrill voice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>The sharpest strokes of adverse fortune are commonly sudden, and the anguish they occasion is in a large measure mitigated by their own severity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>They are unexpected, and we are saved the suffering arising from anxiety and suspense; they paralyze our sensibilities, and while our feelings are recovering their tone, we have time to brace up our fortitude, and familiarize our minds to some extent with the disaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>But scolding is a daily infliction, and even when the shrew is silent, the wretched sufferer is disturbed by the apprehension of an outbreak, for he knows not how soon the brow will grow black and the obedient lips part, and nervously restless, he watches the play of the features, and marks the drift of the conversation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>And while this odious habit is the source of incalculable misery, it does not, like crushing misfortunes, benumb and stupefy, but keeps the feelings stretched to the utmost tension, and morbidly tender, so that the mind is always in a state of disquietude, and sensible to the slightest irritation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/> It is the continued dropping of bitter words that makes the scold so grievous an affliction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>The fluent tongue pours forth complaints, and abuse, and threats, with savage earnestness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>The same misdemeanor, or evil, is harped upon with increasing acerbity and unflagging zest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>It is dropped, some other matter is expatiated upon, then the deed, about which so much has already been said, is taken up again and enlarged upon with fresh vehemence, and thus the ear is vexed with the unceasing sound, and the frowning listener in vain resolves to endure in silence, for he sees that there is no end to the list of evils, and there is no hope for relief from the torture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>The faithful memory of the scold supplies her tongue with ample material for its wonderful powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>The past is brought up and discussed upon.--Present evils are traced to delinquencies and transgressions of gone-by days, and advice and admonition are freely given, but there is a sad want of harmony between the words and the spirit, for the voice is the sharper and the louder during the utterance of wholesome truths, and it is manifest that the brawler rolls the sins under her tongue as a sweet morsel, and takes malicious pleasure in calling them to remembrance and throwing them into the offender's teeth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>The exasperated dame passes from servant to child, from child to father; their misdeeds, and faults, and infirmities are exposed and enlarged upon, every annoyance and vexation that ruffles the surface of domestic life is brought to view, and the enumeration of the many ills is made the more disgusting by exclamations of pity for herself, as though the whole household had entered into a conspiracy with fortune against her peace and happiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>No matter what the inconvenience or the mischance, though it be of a kind that annoys all the members of the family, the censorious and despotic shrew, in the excess of her evil temper, treats the vexation as though it were inflicted upon her alone, and with the set purpose to increase her grievous misery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/> With a quick eye, a hasty temper, and an everlasting tongue, the scold need never be silent for the lack of subjects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>Disposed to find fault, she is instant in detecting the slightest negligence, the smallest offence, the most indifferent delinquency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>Her tongue is always ready to wag, and when it moves no <num value="1">one</num> can form any idea when it will stop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>The length of time she bawls has nothing to do with the thing that kindles her anger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>For if it be a matter that does not admit of many words, her anger quickens the action of her mind, refreshes her retentive memory, and other evils are introduced, so that, no matter what she begins with, she need never close her lips if she is disposed to let the hot stream flow out. The pestilent woman may open her mouth, incited to speak by the awkwardness of a servant, and while her breath is waxing warm, a black spot on a dish catches her eye; that is a greater offence, and her tongue moves still faster, and her voice is lifted higher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>Some <num value="1">one</num> asks for a napkin during a brief pause in the lecture, and this huge negligence blows her anger to a flame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>Thus she passes on from the evils that have set her tongue in motion to others of graver hue, and, growing more and more wrathful every moment, she rises in her reprimands, brings to light certain things of which the participator supposed she was ignorant, charges the crime home upon him with fierceness, and winds up with pitying her deplorable condition, and pronouncing herself the most miserable woman in the world. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/> The courage of these waspish women is as firm as their temper is fiery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>Driven to desperation, the helpless sufferer does sometimes yield to his choler, and attempts to intimidate his brawling spouse; but he never fails to repent his folly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>His stern looks and bitter words only exasperate, and, in a louder and inevitably sharper tone, the undaunted scold pours the rushing torrent into his aching ears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>But though he fails to silence the hateful sound, his case is little, if any, better if he endure in silence, for his pretended calmness enrages the angry scold almost, if not quite, as much as when he pays her back in her own coin.

<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/> --The <rs>North</rs> set out in this contest under several very remarkable, but at the same time very comfortable delusions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>They considered it a plain proposition that <num value="20000000">twenty millions</num> of people could readily whip <num value="8">eight</num>; and they accordingly began to parcel out our Southern lands in <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> farms before they commenced their invasion; forgetting the homely maxim, <q>&#x0022;better not count your chickens before they are hatched&#x0022;</q> This delusion has somewhat cleared away since the affairs at <placeName reg="Bethel, Oxford, Maine" key="tgn,2044460">Bethel</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> and <placeName reg="Springfield, Greene, Missouri" key="tgn,7014532">Springfield</placeName>, but still retains a chronic hold upon the <rs>Northern</rs> mind. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/> Another delusion was fondly cherished in regard to our slave population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>They confidently expected our negroes to rise upon their masters at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> alarm of war; and a servile insurrection to rage throughout the <rs>South</rs>, while their victorious armies were marching triumphantly, plundering and ravishing, <hi rend="italics">ad-libitum,</hi> through our territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>This delusion, too, has been dispelled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>The negroes were never so quiet, never so loyal to their duty, as they have been during the <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> just gone by. They have taken the same interest in the war for the <rs>South</rs> that our white people have done, and have helped to slay <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> soldiers on the field of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>An authentic instance is told of a servant at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> having <measure n="2" type="killed">killed two</measure> soldiers of the enemy, during the progress of the battle, by stoning them to death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have stolen negroes, and persuaded some of them to runaway from their masters on some portions of the sea board; but there is scarcely an instance of negro violence to white people recorded during the whole progress of the present war. The period of the war has, strange to say, been a period remarkable for its exemption from this sort of trouble to the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/> But the most amusing of all the hallucinations of the <rs>North</rs> in the outset of the war, was the belief that their own States <hi rend="italics">fed</hi> the <rs>Southern</rs> people; and that, by blockading our ports, they would <hi rend="italics">starve</hi> us into submission. --<rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are a shrewd and intelligent people in all matters of business and in all practical affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>They ought to have understood the resources of the country well enough to know the fallacy of this notion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>But their belief in our non-production of food was so flattering to their vanity, and so comfortable to their self complacency, that they would not take the trouble to ascertain with certainty the facts of the case which were readily accessible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>And that was the theory of their blockade &mdash; that we would starve by our separation from the <rs>North</rs>; and, like the prodigal son, would in due time return from feeding upon the husks of secession, begging the fare of servants, in the bitterness of our penitence and humiliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>The blockade had other objects indeed; such as that of keeping arms and ammunition out of our reach, and cutting us off from direct communication with <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>; but its primary idea was to starve us into contrition. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/> The census tables of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct> abundantly show that the <rs>South</rs> produced more of the great articles of human food per man and according to population than the <rs>North</rs>; and these tables were everywhere open to Northern inspection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>They remained, however, <q>&#x0022;willingly ignorant&#x0022;</q> of a fact which so ill comported which their favorite theories in regard to the facility of Southern subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>As we took occasion to prove in detail some months ago, the census of <dateStruct value="1850--"><year reg="1850">1850</year></dateStruct> demonstrates that the <rs>South</rs>, though embracing but <num value="0.33">33 per cent</num> of the population of the <rs>Union</rs>, produced wheat more than sufficient for its entire population, exporting considerable quantities to the <rs>North</rs> and to <placeName reg="South America" key="tgn,1000002">South America</placeName>; produced also <num value="0.4">40 per cent</num> of the entire corn crop of the <rs>Union</rs>, and <num value="0.39">39 per cent.</num> of all the animals that were slaughtered for food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>Besides these articles, she produced her rice crop which enters so considerably as an item in the consumption of food; as well as quite as many sweet and <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> potatoes per man as the <rs>North</rs> produced of the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>Besides these articles of food, she produced a very large sugar crop with the due proportion of that most invaluable luxury and necessary of the table &mdash; molasses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>She did all this too, while producing full crops of her <num value="2">two</num> great staples of cotton and tobacco; our export abroad of which, besides the consumption within the <rs>Union</rs>, was in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct> worth <measure n="210000000dollars" type="currency">$210,000,000</measure>! We have no doubt that when the census statistics of <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct> transpire, if not garbled by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government, they will show a considerable increase of the <rs>Southern</rs> production in all these articles of food and of income. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/> Yet, this is the country which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, in their ignorance and stupidity, expect to starve into contrition and submission! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/> When <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> blockades <placeName reg="New Castle, Craig, Virginia" key="tgn,2113212">New castle</placeName>, for the purpose of cutting off its supplies of coal; when <placeName key="tgn,7000490;tgn,2140674" n="0.010 000000.3296	placename;tgn,7000490;australia,Oceania;0.007 000000.2231	placename;tgn,2140674;australia island, madison, louisiana,Madison,Louisiana,United States,North and Central America" reg="australia,Oceania;australia island, madison, louisiana,Madison,Louisiana,United States,North and Central America">Australia</placeName> sends to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> for gold; and when <placeName reg="Connecticut" key="tgn,7007159">Connecticut</placeName> begins to import tin cups, wooden clocks, hams and nutmegs, then the <rs>North</rs> may expect to hear a general wail rising up from all the <rs>South</rs> for bread! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/> The cereal crops of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> are the most enormous ever known in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>It would be no exaggeration to say that they are sufficient, alone, to supply the <rs>South</rs> with food for <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>. It is thus that <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> conspires to confound and bring to derision all Northern calculations in this war. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>It is, in fact, but an extension of the system inaugurated by <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00073" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName></hi>, who fell upon the notable expedient of declaring all slaves contraband, and confiscating them as property belonging to the rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>They both designed to make the war an anti-slavery war, and such it is to all intents and purposes. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/> It will be observed that <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Fremont,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00075" reg="mostcommon:Fremont,nomatch:0"><surname>Fremont</surname></persName></hi> proposes to liberate only such slaves as belong to rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>But, besides that the slaveholders of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> are nearly all <q>&#x0022;rebels&#x0022;</q> in this sense of the term, by the very act of setting free so large a body of negroes, he renders that species of property worthless to all other owners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>If the negroes belonging to the rebels be all set free, it will become impossible for Union men to retain those which belong to them &mdash; They <hi rend="italics">will</hi> run away, and they <hi rend="italics">will</hi>be protected by the abolitionists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>Every slave belonging to a Union man will claim to belong to some Secessionist, He will present himself to the <rs>Federal</rs> officers, all abollitionists at heart, and he will always attain his object.--<hi rend="smallcaps">Fremond</hi>'s proclamation, therefore, is a proclamation of freedom to every slave in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>It were vain to inquire what right, under the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the old <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, any general of division can have to abolish an institution solemnly recognized by it. <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00076" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName></hi> and his myrmidons have utterly <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> destroyed that Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>Martial law has usurped the place of all other law, and the sword has driven before it judge, jury, and all the insignia of the court. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/> There can no longer exist any doubt in the minds of rational men that the <rs>Cabinet</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> hope to succeed in this war by the assistance of the slaves, and that they mean to excite them to a <rs n="General Revolt" type="misc">general revolt</rs> if they can.--The project is as hopeless as it is wicked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/> From the date of the proclamation of your <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs>, declaring the neutrality of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, it has been the settled policy of the authorities of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> to respect <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> as a neutral power, and to carefully avoid all acts that could be construed into a violation of any of her rights as such.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>This policy has been adhered to with perfect fidelity, and will be adhered to by <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> as long as the people of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> will act the part of neutrals, and the <rs>Federal Government</rs> respect their neutrality. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/> But it is proper that I call the attention of your <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs> to the fact that each day brings its accumulation of evidence, forcing me to the conclusion that the <rs>Federal Government</rs> is organizing military companies, battalions, and regiments in the <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">State of Kentucky</placeName>, for avowed purposes of invading <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> and transporting arms to some of her rebellious citizens, thus aiding and encouraging the rebellion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/> It requires no argument to prove to your <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs> that this is a gross and palpable violation of the principle of neutrality which <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> has declared she would maintain, and which I doubt not, it is the purpose of your <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs> to maintain fully and in good faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>I therefore call the attention of your <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs> to the matter, feeling assured that your <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs> will institute such investigations as will develop whatever action as is being taken within your State, and take such steps as will prevent any organization in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, for the purpose of aiding or abetting the <rs>Federal Government</rs> in this wicked war that it wages for the purpose of crushing and subjugating the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/> It is with profound interest and regret that I have witnessed recently the open violation of the neutrality of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> by the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, by the establishment of military encampments and other warlike preparations within the territorial limites and jurisdiction of your State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>If we should unfortunately be on the eve of a collision between our States, produced by the machinations of a common enemy, I desire, at this time, on behalf of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, to renew to your <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs>, as the official representative of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, as the official representative of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, the assurances heretofore given, that the authorities and people of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> have faithfully observed and respected the neutrality of your State, and will, if permitted by the authorities and people of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, continue to do so; that nothing but hostile acts and demonstrations against <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> shall ever initiate the contest between our States, though our citizens of different Governments and they are at war with each other.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/> Under these circumstances we cannot believe that <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> will, at the instigation of either of the belligerents, abandon the position of neutrality so lately and solemnly assumed, or permit it to be used so as to render a hollow peace more harassing and dangerous than open war. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/> I have no doubt that <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> assumed the position of neutrality in good faith, nor do I doubt the determination of your <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs> to maintain it fairly and honorably, but would respectfully ask the concurrence of all departments of your State Government in the removal of these irritating and harassing causes of controversy, which constantly endanger the peaceful relations of our States and people. </p>

What were our assertions?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>We asserted in the first place: The Southern States had a right to separate; the <rs>Constitution</rs> was silent touching the chances of secession, and an amendment to the <rs>Constitution</rs> had provided that all powers not expressly delegated to the <rs>Constitution</rs> are reserved to the several States or to the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>In the second place: That the right of secession being admitted, it is the evident interest of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> to favor, or at the least not to throw obstacles in the way of a revolution which obliterates from <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> polities great State whose action might become embarrassing to <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> powers at any moment; a revolution which simplified by separation the commercial relations of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> with the several States of <placeName reg="North America" key="tgn,1000001">North America</placeName>.
