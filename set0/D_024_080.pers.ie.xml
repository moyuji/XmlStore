<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The old standard of &#x0022;supply and demand&#x0022; is constantly referred to by those who apologize for speculation; and it is insisted that nothing but a scarcity inadequate to the demand enhances prices.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/> Thinking you would like to hear from New Orleans, even if it be through <num value="1">one</num> of the oppressed race who inhabit this wretched prison-house, with many a shudder and tremble, with many a peep at door and window, to see if negro or <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> spy be near, I jot down a few reminiscences of the battle of the <num value="20" type="ordinal">20th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>Yes, we have been again defeated &mdash; a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time &#x0022;has the city been rescued from a domestic foe.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/> About <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time> in the morning a crowd of the rebel women of New Orleans assembled on the levee, to bid farewell to the prisoners going back to swell the ranks of brave men, who will <num value="1">one</num> day free us from the chains that now bind us, and, what is more galling still, the shame that the bitter and unjust have cast upon us. Oh, if people outside only knew how we suffer here they would uncover their heads in future years when they meet an old man, woman, or child, who dwelt here during <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>'s reign of terror, and call them not only patriots, but by a higher title &mdash; martyrs!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>However, our brave soldiers are winning both titles for us in other fields. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/> But I have left the rebels drawn up in line of battle, certain the attack would come, but a little doubtful how it would be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>They were certainly a goodly company, or rather multitude; for, from <placeName reg="Canal Street Ferry">Canal Street Ferry</placeName> almost to <placeName reg="Upper Town, Nye, Nevada" key="tgn,2741155">Carrolton</placeName>, the sunshine fail upon the many- colored robes, and eager, wishful faces, all turned <num value="1">one</num> way, waiting to give the farewell wave, so make the air ring with a shout that, in each heart, was a &#x0022;<name n="God" type="God">God</name> bless you!&#x0022; --then back to their homes, to take up the yoke, and be patient for a little while longer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/> Suddenly, through the well-dressed, well-mannered crowd, ran a murmur. &#x0022;What is it? --What is it?&#x0022; we asked of a lady near. &#x0022;Only that we are ordered to disperse and go home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>I, for <num value="1">one</num> won't go. I came out here to see the boys off and if I die for it, I mean to see them go.&#x0022; &#x0022;But, <rs type="role2">Madam</rs>,&#x0022; said a man standing near, who had listened in horror to this rebel speech, &#x0022;the officer said that if the crowd does not disperse within half an hour, it will be fired into!&#x0022; Yet, not <num value="1">one</num> sign of going home was seen on the face of any <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>A little uneasy, helpless, looking around for a place of refuge, when the cannons, <num value="10">ten</num> in number, were brought up and arranged in battle line, unlimbered and loaded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/> We only gathered closer together, and waited the attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>A little man, in big Scots and gauntlet buckskin gloves, commanded the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.--Determination and Haired were our commanders; and up to <time value="4oclock">4 o'clock</time> they had proved themselves good <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>The little man blustered, puffed, and, in the name of the <hi rend="italics">invincible</hi> <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding General</rs>, ordered us to go home; but that name bore no magic spell to awaken fear an our ranks. --So, vanquished by the persistence and laughter of the crowd, Buckskin retired to await reinforcements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Here they come; and there is some little uneasiness in the rebel- ranks &mdash; for, glittering in the sunshine, comes a long string of bayonets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>They form in line; Buckskin gives the order, &#x0022;Fix bayonets &mdash; charge!&#x0022; And they do charge &mdash; into the midst of the &#x0027;<rs type="color">red</rs>, <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">red</rs>&#x0027; bonnets, parasols, crying children, and stubborn women, the brave (?) Northerners win their gallant way. &#x0027;Our forces fall slowly back, with many well sent shots of satire and ridicule, that gail and harass the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/> As after defeat it is the fashion to change the base of operations, so, when driven from the vicinity of the boat, we rallied and formed into line again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>Our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> were everywhere, strengthening our somewhat breathless ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Again was a charge made, our foe capturing some <num value="24">two dozen</num> handkerchiefs, each with a Confederate flag embroidered in the corner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>We rallied, as again, with a sort of stupid despair, the enemy charged upon us. Our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> grew stronger at every charge, and when night closed upon the field, if the brave <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> held <num value="1">one</num> part of the levee, the &#x0022;<rs type="color">red</rs>, <rs type="color">white</rs>, and <rs type="color">red</rs>&#x0022; bonnets held the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Of course we disbanded, instructed by our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> to return bright and early next day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/> If I had space I would tell you how we cooked and took down to the prisoners the best dinner we could find; how, during the <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> the boat staid at the wharf, the levee was crowded; and, when they did go, how we were all there, and waved, and shouted until we were hoarse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>But to tell of all the events of those <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> would tax both your time and patience; so, with <num value="1">one</num> incident of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day's fight I will close. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/> Standing near the boat, where Buckskin drew up his men, was a fare young girl, dressed in deep mourning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/><measure n="3months" type="date">Three months</measure> ago the sad news had come that the brother who, for <num value="2">two</num> long years, had fought so bravely, had given up his life at last; and now, on that boat, went her only remaining <num value="1">one</num> to take his place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>She did not heed the crowd or heed the man who ordered her to move, until the brute stuck his bayonet in her arm. Placing her hand over the wound, she turned and said: <q>&#x0022;If my brother were on shore you should pay for this; I am not going home until that boat goes out;&#x0022;</q> and turned her back upon him. The wretch struck her with his bayonet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>Quick as lightning a stout <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> woman returned the blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>The bully shrank back and said: &#x0022;You go to h--.&#x0022; &#x0022;No,&#x0022; was the retort, &#x0022;<persName n="Jackson,,Stonewall,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="default:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><foreName>Stonewall</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> has sent to many <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> there that I could find no room.&#x0022; A shout went up that caused <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> to get out of the way in a double quick. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/> In conclusion, let me say, it was no mob that had gathered to see this boat, going to &#x0022;the land of our desires.&#x0022; The very <hi rend="italics">elite</hi> of the city were there.

<head>Sufferings in the <rs>North</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/> An Episcopal clergyman in <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Northwestern States</rs>, writing to a friend in this city, says: <q>&#x0022;The derangements of business which have taken place have beggared <num value="1000">thousands</num>; the battles which have been fought have widowed and orphaned tens of <num value="1000">thousands</num>; our once fertile valleys have become great cemeteries, and our churches, hotels, and colleges converted into hospitals.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/> This is a picture of the effects of the war in the <rs>North</rs> which we are not permitted to see in the columns of Northern newspapers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>But it comes from a more reliable source than a passioned and <unclear>pfligate</unclear> press, and is unquestionably true in every particular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>The destruction of life among Northern soldiers must have been terrible indeed, when, with the multitudinous resources which that populous section possesses for the reception and relief of the sick and wounded, &#x0022;churches, hotels, and colleges are converted into hospitals. &#x0022; and the &#x0022;once fertile valleys have become great cemeteries.&#x0022; We venture to say that the <rs>Southern</rs> people are not aware of a <num value="100" type="ordinal">hundredth</num> part of the distress and destruction which the <rs>North</rs> has suffered in this war. The Southern bullet has not been thrown away, and the diseases of the <rs>Southern</rs> climate have told with fearful force upon the invaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>The powers of Nature have combined with the energies of men to decimate the immense hosts which have vainly endeavored to subjugate the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>The holiday entertainment which the <rs>North</rs> promised itself in this war has become a ghostly carnival of blood and death, and already it recoils in secret from the horrors which remain undisclosed in the silent and solemn future. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/> We are fully prepared to believe that the great mass of the <rs>Northern</rs> people, if the politicians would leave them to themselves, would at once make peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>They are satisfied with glory, they have had enough of the &#x0022;bubble reputation,&#x0022; such as it is, and they would be glad, upon any terms, to exchange the musket for that more familiar weapon, the yardstick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>It is not that they lack courage; but, like all commercial people, they count the cost of their undertakings, and are not enamored of any enterprise that doesn't pay.--They shudder at the repetition of the dismal and sanguinary scenes of the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>They dread the idea of being called off themselves or having their sons and brothers called off to encounter the sharp edge of the <placeName reg="Southern river">Southern</placeName> bayonet, or the equally deadly assault of Southern diseases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>Their imagination paints the future in sombre colors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>So long as foreigners could be employed to fight their battles, they could not have many of their men killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>But now it is their own fish and blood that must be dragged off to the war, and in view of the terrible facts, we believe <num value="9">nine</num> out of <num value="10">ten</num> of them, in their inmost hearts, would rejoice if peace could be declared to morrow, at the cost of acknowledging the entire and perfect independence of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>We believe that <num value="9">nine</num> out of <num value="10">ten</num> of the <rs>Northern</rs> army would vote the same way as the <rs>Northern</rs> citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>And yet peace is so far off at this moment that we are unable, with the strongest telescope of Hope, to descry over the vast expanse of raging waters, even the faintest resemblance of land or to make out in the clouded heavens a single star, or <num value="1">one</num> hue of the rainbow to indicate that the storm will cease. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/> The war most by this time have demonstrated, that the people have as little control of a <rs n="Republican" type="political">republican</rs> as of a monarchical government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>No matter what the people may wish, how they may suffer, how they may groan in <unclear></unclear> and despair, they have placed in the hands of their rulers that terrific engine of despotism, a vast standing army, and henceforth their lives and fortunes and happiness are at his entire disposal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>Even the army itself, such is the complete control which military <unclear></unclear> gives to a single head, can no more exert its power to give relief to the people or itself than a horse can throw off a practiced rider.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>We place no confidence for the future, therefore, upon any longings which the people, or even the <orgName n="U. S. Army" type="org">army of the United States</orgName> may have for peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>Reward is on their backs, and, <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">nolens volens,</hi></foreign> they must go when and whither that devil drives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>Sure destruction is before them; fields piled with their dead, livers running crimson with their gore; churches, hotels, and colleges crowded with their dead and dying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>Is it not fearful that the few should thus sack and ruin the many; that politicians and speculators should thus banquet upon the life-blood of the multitude whilst they never venture their own persons with in the possibility of harm?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>And yet so it is; and <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00187" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> cracks his stale jokes in safety, whilst the death groans of his dupes are burthening every gale; and <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00188" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> drinks his wine gally whilst the wine of life is rushing red and fast from <num value="1000">thousands</num> of bosoms which but for him might be heating high with life and happiness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/> There is no hope of a termination of the war except in crushing the enemy upon every battle field, and making him feel that the <rs>South</rs> is but just buckling on its armor for the war, and is determined to fight it out till the crack of dawn corner than return to the detested Union, or yield an lota of its sacred rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>The pioneer of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> cannot carry on much longer such a burthen as this war, if its fortunes <unclear></unclear> battle continue to prove as dismal and <unclear>ign</unclear> in the future as the past. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
