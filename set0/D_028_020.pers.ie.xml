<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>They were brethren in patriotism and elevation of character.--Both were devoted to the cause of the <rs>Union</rs>, and neither of them ever thought of their own interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>If there was any human weakness about either of these great men, it was a total neglect and oblivion of <num value="1">number one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>No <num value="1">one</num> was more earnest and emphatic than he in his advocacy of Southern rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>He would shoulder his musket and fight for the <rs>South</rs> if its slave institutions were assailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>He was fond of pointing to <placeName reg="Jamaica, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005556">Jamaica</placeName> and <placeName reg="Republicana Dominicana" key="tgn,7005388">St. Domingo</placeName> to show the evil effects of abolishing slavery.

It requires other qualities than he possessed to constitute that character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The plumage of the swan and the music of the lark combined in <num value="1">one</num> bird would not make an eagle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>It does not require either quickness of apprehension, or inventive powers, or oratory and scholarship, to make up greatness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>But immovable steadiness of purpose and the most habitual and exclusive devotion to principle are absolutely essential to a great man. <persName n="Everett,,Edward,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="default:Everett,Edward,,,"><foreName>Edward</foreName> <surname>Everett</surname></persName> might describe the character of <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>, but he never could imitate the qualities which he described.
