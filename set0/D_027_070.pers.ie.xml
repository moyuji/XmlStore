<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Perhaps the main facts have thus been made public, but only <num value="1">one</num> side of the story has been told, and that, with all the exaggeration and falsehood of particular instances, is incomplete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>In order to make known the true story, taking into consideration at the same time the limited space allowed in a daily paper, I cannot do better than transcribe the narrative from my diary, written from day to day during the cruise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>This I do literally and without alteration, which fact will be sufficient apology for its faults. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The <term type="ship">steamers</term> <rs type="ship">Flamingo</rs>, <rs type="ship">Caps Fear,</rs> and <rs type="ship">Yadkin,</rs> were made fast to us at high tide, and in a short time we were afloat steaming down towards <placeName key="tgn,2074695" n="1.000 6" reg="fort caswell, brunswick, north carolina">Fort Caswell</placeName>, preparatory to a trial of the other bar. All day long we lay at anchor off <placeName reg="Southport, Brunswick, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014522">Smithville</placeName>, a village somewhat visited in years gone by as a summer watering-place, but now looking in the last stages of chronic dilapidation.--About <time value="8oclock">8 o'clock</time> came the boatswain's pipe to &#x0022;up anchor.&#x0022; Rounded the fort at <num value="9">nine</num>, and at <num value="10">ten</num> were on the bar. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> At this hour the moon had gone down, a few black clouds floated in the sky, and the stars shone dimly through a thin gauze-like vapor that rose from the water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>A fair night to run out. After passing the bar, came upon <num value="2">two</num> blockaders, <num value="1">one</num> on either bow, much closer in than they had been during the day. Ran between them, and soon had both abeam; but, unfortunately, a stream of flame burst from the smoke-stacks and betrayed us. The enemy immediately showed a signal light, but no answer being received, gave us a shot, quickly followed by others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>This was repeated on the other side; but every shot went over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Running at a speed of nearly <num value="15">fifteen</num> knots, we soon left them in the dark and, although they fired several rockets to discover our position by their glare, soon got beyond reach of rockets or shell.--We saw <num value="3">three</num> more blockaders, but passed them unobserved, and in a few hours were out at sea. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The dense black smoke rising from the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee's</rs> funnels showed he was making every exertion to overhaul us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Another signal light was shown forward; but as neither was answered, he opened fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>For a few moments his shell pass over us, and then, as we increase our speed, they gradually fall astern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/> At <time value="6oclock">six o'clock</time> we were standing northeast by east.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>The air was close and smokey, made more so by the ships burning near us. This was very favorable, as it prevented our smoke being seen at a distance.

When alongside, she was ordered to heave to, and in doing so swept down upon us, and struck us before we could get away; but, fortunately, very far aft. Our mainmast fell, and the deck was swept clean of everything standing, carrying away even the iron bulwark rail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>Being a very large ship, towering high above us, she would have inevitably sunk us had she struck amidships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>The mast fell over the side; and the rigging being cut away, swung round under the propeller.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/> The baggage these people carried was of the strangest description &mdash; broken pots and pans, jars, crockery, cracked vases, bird cages, cats, dogs, and other pets, brought with them from the Old World.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>These they all insisted upon taking, but in many instances had to be refused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/> Weather thick and foggy, with light breezes from southeast, which hauled later to south southwest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>It is quite cold for <dateStruct><month>August</month></dateStruct>, and the atmosphere plainly indicates our progress northward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/> Meanwhile the ship had been turned, and was now going northward, the steamer following.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>About <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time>, the fog came up suddenly, and completely hid her from our sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>We were in great danger of losing sight of her altogether, but steamed on in her direction, ringing the bell and blowing a fog horn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>In a short time we heard the ship's bell in answer, and made her light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>A hawser was carried to her to prevent such accidents in future; and while the crew were removing the stores and preparing for destruction she was towing the steamer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>We got very little from her, the captain and mate being allowed to take everything they wanted, even to a roll of carpeting that was on the manifest. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>The vessel was worth, perhaps, <measure n="1700dollars" type="currency">one thousand seven hundred dollars</measure>. In these fishing crafts some <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="10">ten</num> men are engaged, and fish on shares.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>This is called a <hi rend="italics">profitable</hi> business by these rough, simple people along the coast, and is their only dependence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/> The appearance of several mirages of remarkable beauty and distinctiveness have afforded us some pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>The fog clouds that hang low upon the water, play fantastic tricks with the sails beneath, or in them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>Sometimes a <hi rend="italics">fac <unclear></unclear></hi> of a vessel is seen reversed upon a cloud, apparently high in the air; sometimes it appears cut in half, <num value="1">one</num> part towering, like a marble column, an <measure n="100feet" type="distance">hundred feet</measure> in the air. Sometimes, again, they look like little toy boats floating a few feet above the surface of the water, and then, when the mist is thick and the vessel near, it looms up largely, making a fishing schooner look as large as a line-of-battle ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>On the transport we (that is, all the prisoners captured,) were treated with great rudeness; the trunks and clothing of some were stolen, even my own cap was stolen from my head, and the officers refused to have it recovered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>Upon arriving at New York we were marched through the streets, some <num value="40">forty</num> being in irons, and carried to the <orgName n="U. S. Marshal" type="org">United States Marshal's</orgName> office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>The beef was generally so tough that it could not be eaten, and the bread was often raw. This fare we could have put up with if we had been allowed to purchase; but we were forbidden to purchase or receive from friends any article whatever of food or clothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>We could not even receive an apple from the hands of a visitor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>We were restricted in clothing to the outward suit we had on and <num value="2">two</num> changes of underclothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933"/>Distinguished as they are by marvellous gallantry, and animated with an undying spirit, they yet require the assistance of greater numbers, and these numbers must be speedily forthcoming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936"/>Accordingly, with a view to the execution of this law, I have certified for exemption a large number of justices of the peace and other county officers, and am pained to believe that the duty imposed upon them has not been efficiently discharged; and I am, therefore, bound to declare that, if this apathy and negligence continue, I shall feel it my duty to revoke many of the certificates which I have already granted, in order that such officers may be required to take the places of the delinquents whom, by their negligence, they have failed to restore to their several commands. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="937"/> The State must have the services of her able-bodied men, and delinquents must be brought back to their duty, or those neglecting to arrest them must take their places.
