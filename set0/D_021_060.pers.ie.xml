<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> <rs n="Frenchman" type="propernoun">Frenchmen</rs> fight for glory, <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs> for gain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/><placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> will not recognize our independence or raise the blockade until it is her interest so to do. At present, there are several strong reasons why she does not intervene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Her citizens own Northern stocks and securities for debt to the amount of <num value="800000000">eight hundred millions</num> of dollars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>All this would be lost if she interfered in <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> affairs and deciared the blockade inefficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Although she does not fear the <rs>North</rs>, and in full consciousness of strength listens with contemptuous silence to <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> insults, threats, and braggadocios, yet she knows that Northern privateers would, in the event of war, seriously disturb her trade and that is too great and valuable an interest to be impaired or jecparded if it can be honorably avoided. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> She wishes to encourage the production of cotton in <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName> and her other Southern dependencies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The blockade will effect this object far better than any other measure.--There is abundant cotton grown in <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName> and other parts of <placeName reg="Asia" key="tgn,1000004">Southern Asia</placeName> to supply all our demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>She has only to give more for it than the <name>Asiatics</name> will give at home, and she is sure to procure it. The advancement of price occasioned by the increased demand would not, probably, enhance the cost of her annual supply a <num value="100000000">hundred millions</num> of dollars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>At this rate, by supplying herself from <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName> and avoiding war with the <rs>North</rs>, she might possibly, in a <num value="12">twelve</num> month, save <num value="700000000">seven hundred millions</num> of dollars, stimulate, the growth of cotton in her provinces, and become partially (save a modicum of our long staple to blend with the <name>Asiatic</name>) independent of the <rs>South</rs> for her usual annual supply. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> Besides, from the <rs>Queen</rs> downwards, the <name>Abolition</name> feeling, prejudice and influence in the present ruling party combination in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, is very powerful, and the <rs>Government</rs> hesitates to take part with slaveholders, however just their cause. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> Of course, <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> is too sagacious not to see that she has a vast interest in the commerce and carrying trade of the <rs>South</rs>; and she will so shape her policy, doubtless, as to prevent, if possible, any other nation from getting the advantage of her in the participation in that trade and commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>But just at this time such is the magnitude of the existing alliances with the <rs>North</rs> that she pauses to coquette for a time with her own interests in order to get the benefit she may derive from delay and the developments that are rapidly taking place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Should she even derive the permanent separation of the old Union, as she, no doubt, does most heartily, she may yet conceive that the situation of affairs favorable to her interests will be much improved by the exhaustion and bankruptcy of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>But this view opens an extensive line of reflection for the mind, for which we have not space in this article. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> Of late years <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> act in most singular and suspicious concert; and it is to be presumed that <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, will not intervene in our behalf until <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> is ready to follow her lead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Notwithstanding that it is very evident <persName n="Napoleon,,Louis,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="default:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><foreName>Louis</foreName> <surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> is our friend, and desires to inaugurate an active policy affecting our relations and interests very promptly, it is the undoubted policy of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> to co-operate with <persName n="England,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:England,nomatch:0"><surname>England</surname></persName> and not to <unclear></unclear> without her concurrence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> Let us dismiss, then, all expectation of foreign aid, and calmly inquire what injury, if any, we have sustained, or may hereafter sustain, from the blockade. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> It is at once obvious that this measure of the <rs>North</rs> compels her to diffuse her naval force along a coast of several <measure n="1000miles" type="distance">thousand miles</measure>, and prevents a concentration of that force in an attack against any of our seaboard cities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>But for the blockade, it is quite possible that by combining her whole naval strength, and directing it against, a single point, she might take, <num value="1">one</num> after another, all of our seaboard towns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>We think that <placeName reg="Norfolk, England, United Kingdom" key="tgn,7008160">Norfolk</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, <placeName reg="Charleston, Kanawha, West Virginia" key="tgn,7013583">Charleston</placeName>, <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>, and New Orleans, owe their security thus far to this very blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Besides, it enormously increases the war expenses of the <rs>North</rs>, and it is the rapidly increasing and intolerable burden of those expenses, alone, that can exhaust her strength &mdash; and so end the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> Again, the blockade is fast making us a manufacturing people, so far as the implements of war and necessaries of life are concerned, and to that extent only do we care about becoming a manufacturing people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Independence of foreign nations for the supplies necessary in times of war, should be attained in some way; and nothing will so effectually teach us what is needed for this purpose, and how we shall manufacture and produce it, as this blockade. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> Confederate money or notes and Confederate bonds are now., as a currency, as good as <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/><rs type="color">Gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs> have ceased to be a currency, and become a marketable commodity, but Confederate notes pass as freely and purchase as much, agreeable to their denomination, as would a metallic currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>This is evidenced by the price of grain, which is selling at ordinary prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The higher prices of other things is owing to their scarcity, not to the depreciation of our paper currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Could a nation be wholly excluded from all trade and intercourse with all other peoples, it might makes on paper issues of its Government money for all purposes, and wholly exclude a metallic currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>So long as the blockade continues, we are in this situation, but when it ends, our pecuniary difficulties will begin; for Confederate paper will not answer for foreign trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The removal of the blockade, therefore, may produce serious national embarrassments, which nothing but our valuable staples could prevent from reaching the extreme of national bankruptcy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>It would be hard for a bankrupt government to carry on a war. The truth of our theory is about to be tested in the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>We predict that their foreign trade, which requires <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs>, will destroy the currency of their treasury notes, and embarrass the prosecution of the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> When once we become satisfied that we have nothing to hope from foreign aid, and that the blockade will be continued, we shall redouble our exertions, and if not conquer the <rs>North</rs>, will keep her at bay, and soon exhaust her. She relies, solely on our cotton and tobacco to sustain her credit, and enable her to continue the war. She is now buying <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName> cotton in the <rs>English</rs> market, and if we be true to ourselves, she will never get enough of cotton and tobacco from us to supply her home demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>We will burn them if necessary, but think it will be much better to determine resolutely and devotedly to defend them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> It will be far more honorable to achieve our independencies without foreign aid; and independence so achieved will bind our Confederacy together with adamantine chains; for we shall see and feel that our safety and existence as free States depends entirely on our cordial and permanent union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Paper constitutions, of States or Unions, and paper articles of confederations, are not worth the parchment they are written on, except in so far as they ex- </p> <milestone unit="column" n="6"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>And so craftily have the people been befooled by their public servants, that in the midst of such political and social corruption as might well provoke the <name>Almighty</name> to visit us with his heaviest judgments, we have looked down with contempt upon the poor, oppressed, and benighted subjects of. <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> monarchy and despotism, where life and property were a <num value="100">hundred</num> fold more secure than on our own continent, and whose, people, if deprived of a master, would have relapsed into barbarism. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>After introducing the offender to the whipping post, there was a general dispersion of the city functionaries of high and low degree till the next morning, the city governing itself in general without any difficulty, and keeping up the mayoralty at some expense, as an ornamental weathercock to the municipal spire, which should add variety to its proportions, and enable every <num value="1">one</num> to discover which way the wind blew. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> But since those calm and somewhat monotonous days, when we smoked our cigar and talked at street corners, as if smoking and spinning street yarns were the great business of life, a change has come over this once placid and domestic old city, so thorough and wonderful that we sometimes wonder whether it is not all a dream, and have to take several pinches of ourselves before we can fully establish to our own satisfaction the fact of our identity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>We scarcely meet a familiar face in the streets, or in any of the public places of amusement and resort.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/> As soon as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> get a foothold on Southern sell, their leaders issue a proclamation, in which they entertain us with a description of their character and purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>According to their own account of themselves, they are the most humane and honest people in the world, and have no intention of interfering with the property or rights of anybody, nor even with their lives if they will get out of their why. <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> and <placeName key="tgn,7014076" n="1.000 35" reg="goldsboro, wayne, north carolina">Goldsborough</placeName>'s say of themselves and the murderous and marauding crew, whose hands are steeped in Southern blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/><q>&#x0022;We are Christians as well as yourselves, and we profess to know full well, and to feel profoundly, the same obligations of the character.&#x0022;</q> If they hadn't said this, we should certainly never have discovered it from their conduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>We have it from an eye-witness that they committed all sorts of depredations on <placeName reg="Roanoke Island, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014345">Roanoke Island</placeName>, as they have everywhere else where they have obtained a feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>They say: <q>&#x0022;The Southern leaders have imposed upon your credulity by calling you of wicked had even diabolical intentions on our part; of our desire to destroy your freedom, demolish your property, liberate your slaves, injure your women, and such enormities &mdash; all of which, we assure you, is not only ridiculous, but utterly and willfully <unclear></unclear>&#x0022;</q> Perhaps the voracious <placeName reg="Burnside county">Burnside Co.</placeName> would have us believe that the war did not begin with a proclamation of <q>&#x0022;Beauty and Booty&#x0022;</q> in New York, that the women, when the soldiers left that city, did not invoke each of them to bring back the head of a Southern man, and that the <orgName n="New York Tribune" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi></orgName> did not declare that the war should not end till Southern men were driven from their homes, and were compelled to look upon their wives and children famished and in rags.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>If he says all this is falsehood, he must charge it upon the New York papers, which contained these statements, and not upon the <rs>Southern</rs> leaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>Perhaps he will also deny that Northern soldiers, on their way to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, declared that they did not intend to leave an unpolluted household in all <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and that the letter bags seized by our army at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> were full of letters invoking them to this hellish treatment of women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>Whether he denies it or not, the fact can be proved by better men than himself, and by the letters themselves, which still remain in Southern hands.--Or, when he denounces as falsehood, their intention to kidnap Southern slaves, he is not aware of the fact that the slaves of every Secessionist have been taken from him by <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Old Abe,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s orders, wherever the <rs>Northern</rs> army have been able to do it; when he denies that our property is to be demolished, he has never heard of Southern houses and barns set on fire, nor of wholesale confiscation acts; when he says that it is a <q>&#x0022;ridiculous falsehood&#x0022;</q> that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> desire to destroy our freedom, he is ignorant of the existence of <placeName reg="Fort Lafayette">Fort Lafayette</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,2335574" n="1.000 8" reg="fort warren, suffolk, massachusetts">Fort Warren</placeName>, and other <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Bastiles, and knows nothing of the <num value="30">thirty</num> respectable citizens of <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>, who have been lately torn from their homes to join the long procession of exiles from their native land to <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>He might also know, if he know anything of Southern sentiment, that the leaders are far behind the people in the energy and fire of their resistance to Northern invasion.--Who is it that has filled these armies, which the <rs>Northern</rs> journals pretend are larger than their own?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>It is an army of <hi rend="italics">volunteers,</hi> composed of the people, in which every Southern family has a representative, and some as many as <num value="20">twenty</num>, mothers giving up their darling children and wives their husbands, and urging them to die rather than permit the subjugation of their native land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>They charged with uncommon spirit at several points along on the line, but most particularly at a point undefended by entrenchments, down a hollow which separated the <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName> under <persName n="Buckner,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00139" reg="nearbymention:Buckner,Gen,,,"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</roleName> <surname>Buckner</surname></persName> from the right of the centre, commanded by <persName n="Simon,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00140" reg="mostcommon:Simon,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Simon</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>This charge was prosecuted with uncommon vigor, but was met with a determined spirit of resistance, a cool, deliberate courage, both by the troops of <persName n="Buckner,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00141" reg="nearbymention:Buckner,Gen,,,"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brig.-Gen.</roleName> <surname>Buckner</surname></persName> and <persName n="Himan,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00142" reg="mostcommon:Himan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Himan</surname></persName>, which drove the enemy, discomfited and cut to pieces, back upon the position he had assumed in the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>Too high praise cannot be bestowed upon the battery of <persName n="Porter,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00143" reg="mostcommon:Porter,John,C.,,:1"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Porter</surname></persName>, for their participation in the rout of the enemy in this assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>My position was immediately in front of the point of attack, and I was thus enabled to witness more distinctly the incidents of it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/> The enemy continued their fire upon different parts of our entrenchments throughout the night, which deprived our men of every opportunity of sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>We lay that night upon our arms in the trenches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>We confidently expected at the dawn of day a more vigorous attack than ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>But in this we were entirely mistaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>The day advanced, and no preparation seemed to be making for a general onset.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>But an extremely annoying fire was kept up from the enemy's sharpshooters throughout the whole length of the entrenchments, from their long-range rifles.--Whilst this mode of attack was not attended with any considerable loss, it nevertheless confined the men to their trenches and prevented their taking their usual rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>No stood the affairs of the field until <time value="3pm">3 o'clock P. M.</time>, when the fleet of gunboats in full force advanced upon the fort and opened fire &mdash; They advanced in the shope of a crescent, and kept up a constant and incessant fire for <num value="1">one</num> hour and <num value="0.5">a half</num>, which was replied to with uncommon spirit and vigor by the <q>&#x0022;fort.&#x0022;</q>--Case the boats reached a point within a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> of the <q>&#x0022;fort,&#x0022;</q> at which time it was that <num value="3">three</num> of their boats sustained serious injuries from our batteries, and were complied to fall back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>The line was broken, and the enemy discomfited on the water, giving up the fight entirely, which he never afterwards renewed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>I was satisfied, from the incidents of the last <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure>, that the enemy did not intend again to give us battle in our trenches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>They had been fairly repulsed, with very heavy slaughter, upon every effort to storm our position; and it was fair to infer that they would not again renew the unavailing attempt at our dislodgment, when certain means to effect the same end without loss were perfectly at their command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>We were aware of the fact that extremely heavy reinforcements had been continually arriving day and night, for <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> and nights, and I had no doubt whatever that their whole available force on the western waters could, and would, be concentrated here if it was deemed necessary to reduce our position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>I had already seen the impossibility of holding out for any length of time with our inadequate number and indefensible position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>There was no place within our entrenchments but could be reached by the enemy's artillery from their boats, or their batterie.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>It was but fair to inform that, while they, kept up a sufficient fire upon our entrenchments to keep our men from sleep and prevent repose, their object was merely to give time to pass a column above us on the river, both on the right and the left banks, end thus to cut off all our communications and to prevent the possibility of agrees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>I thus saw clearly that but <num value="1">one</num> course was left by which a rational hope could be entertained of saving the garrison, or a part of it. That was to dislodge the enemy from his position on our left, and thus to pass our people into the open country, lying southward towards <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>I called for a consultation of the officers of divisions and brigades, to take place after dark, when this plan was laid before them, approved and adopted, and at which it was determined to move from the trenches as an early hour on the next morning, and attack the enemy in his position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>It was agreed that the attack should commence upon our extreme left, and this duty was assigned <persName n="Fillow,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00144" reg="mostcommon:Fillow,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</roleName> <surname>Fillow</surname></persName>, existed by <persName n="Johnson,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00145" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,William,H.,,"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, having also under his command commanders of brigades, <persName n="Baldwin,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00146" reg="nearbymention:Baldwin,George,T.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Baldwin</surname></persName>, commanding <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> troops, and <persName n="Wharton,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00147" reg="nearbymention:Wharton,Sue,G.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Wharton</surname></persName> and <persName n="McCausland,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00148" reg="mostcommon:McCausland,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>McCausland</surname></persName>, commanding <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginians</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>The attack on the left was delayed longer than I expected, and consequently the enemy was found in position when our troops advanced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>The attack, however, on our part was extremely spirited, and although the resistance of the enemy was obstinate, and their numbers for exceeded ours, our people succeeded in driving them discomfited and terrible cut to pieces from the entire left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>The Kentucky troops, under <rs type="role">Brig.</rs>- <persName n="Buckner,,Gen,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00150" reg="default:Buckner,Gen,,,"><foreName>Gen</foreName> <surname>Buckner</surname></persName>, advanced from their position behind the entrenchments upon the <rs>Wynn</rs>'s <num value="40">Forty</num> road, but not until the enemy had been driven in a great measure from the position he occupied in the morning. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/> I had ordered on the night before the <num value="2">two</num> regiments stationed in <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee">Fort Donelson</placeName> to occupy the trenches vacated by <persName n="Buckner,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00151" reg="nearbymention:Buckner,Gen,,,"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brig.-Gen.</roleName> <surname>Buckner</surname></persName>'s forces, which, together with the men whom he detached to assist in this purpose, I thought sufficient to hold them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/> My intention was to hold, with <orgName n="command"><persName n="Buckner,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00152" reg="nearbymention:Buckner,Gen,,,"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</roleName> <surname>Buckner</surname></persName>'s command</orgName>, the <placeName reg="Wynn's Ferry">Wynn's Ferry</placeName> road, and thus to prevent the enemy, during the night, from occupying the position on our left which he occupied to the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>I give him orders upon the field to that effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>Leaving him in position, I started for the right of our command to see that all was secure there, my intention being if things could be hold in the condition they then were, to move the whole army, if possible to the open country lying south ward beyond the <unclear></unclear>Forges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>During my absence, and from some misapprehension, I presume, of the <unclear></unclear> order given, Brig-<persName n="Gen,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00153" reg="mostcommon:Gen,A.,A.,A.,:1"><surname>Gen</surname></persName>, <persName n="Fillow,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00154" reg="mostcommon:Fillow,nomatch:0"><surname>Fillow</surname></persName> ordered <persName n="Buckner,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00155" reg="nearbymention:Buckner,Gen,,,"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brig-Gen.</roleName> <surname>Buckner</surname></persName> to leave his position. </p> <milestone unit="column" n="6"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/> on the <placeName reg="Wynn's Ferry">Wynn's Ferry</placeName> road end to resume, his place in his trenches on the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>This movement was nearly executed before I was aware of it. As the enemy was pressing upon the trenches, I deemed that the execution of this last order was all that was left to be done, The enemy, in fact, succeeded in occupying an angle of the trenches on the extreme right of <orgName n="command"><persName n="Buckner,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00156" reg="nearbymention:Buckner,Gen,,,"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</roleName> <surname>Buckner</surname></persName>'s command</orgName>; and as the fresh forces of the enemy had begun already to move towards our left to occupy the position they held in the morning, and as we had no force adequate to oppose their progress, we had to submit to the mortification of seeing the ground which we had won by such a severe conflict in the morning re-occupied by the enemy before <time value="12am">midnight</time>. The enemy had been landing reinforcements throughout the day. His numbers had been augmented to <num value="83">eighty-three</num> regiments. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/> Our troops were completely exhausted by <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure> and nights of continued conflict &mdash; To renew it with any hope of successful result was obviously vain, and such I understood to be the unanimous opinion of all the officers present at the council called to consider what was best to be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>I thought, and so announced, that a desperate onset upon the right of the enemy's forces on the ground where we had attacked them in the morning, might result in the extrication of a considerable proportion of the command from the position we were in, and this opinion I understood to be concurred in by all who were present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>But it was likewise agreed, with the same unanimity, that it would result in the slaughter of nearly all who did not succeed in effecting their escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>The question then arose, whether, or in point of humanity and a sound military policy, a course should be adopted from which the probabilities were that the larger portion of the command would be cut to pieces in an unavailing fight against over whelming numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>I understood the general sentiment to be adverse to the proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>I felt that in this sentience, whilst it might be questioned whether I should, as commander of the army, lead it to certain destruction in an unavailing fight, yet I had a right individually to determine that I would not survive a surrender there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>To satisfy both propositions, I agreed to hand over the command to <persName n="Buckner,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00157" reg="nearbymention:Buckner,Gen,,,"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier General</roleName> <surname>Buckner</surname></persName> through <persName n="Pillow,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00158" reg="mostcommon:Pillow,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier General</roleName> <surname>Pillow</surname></persName>, and to make an effort for my own extrication by any and every means that might present themselves to me. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/> I therefore directed <persName n="Forrest,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00159" reg="mostcommon:Forrest,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Forrest</surname></persName>, a daring and determined officer, at the head of an efficient regiment of cavalry, to be present for the purpose of as companying me in what I supposed would be an effort to pass through the enemy's lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>I announced the fact upon turning the command over to <persName n="Buckner,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00160" reg="nearbymention:Buckner,Gen,,,"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier Gen.</roleName> <surname>Buckner</surname></persName> that I would bring away with me, by any means I could, my own particular brigade, the propriety of which was acquiesced in on all hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>This by various modes I succeeded in accomplishing to a great extent, and would have brought off my whole command in <num value="1">one</num> way or another if I had had the assistance of the field officers, who were absent from several of the regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>The command was turned over to <persName n="Buckner,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00161" reg="nearbymention:Buckner,Gen,,,"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</roleName> <surname>Buckner</surname></persName>, who at once opened negotiations with the enemy, which resulted in the surrender of the place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>Thus ended the conflict running through <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure> and <num value="4">four</num> nights; a large portion of which time it was maintained with the greatest fierceness and obstinacy, in which we, with a force not exceeding <num value="13000">13,000</num>, (a large portion of whom were illy armed,) succeeded in resisting and driving back with discomfiture an army of more than <num value="80000">80,000</num> men. I have no means of accurately estimating the loss of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>From what I saw upon the battlefield, from what I witnessed throughout the whole period of the conflict, from what I was able to learn from sources of information deemed by me worthy of credit, I have no doubt that the enemy's loss in killed and wounded reached a number beyond (<num value="5000">5,000</num>) <hi rend="italics"><num value="5000">five thousand</num>.</hi> Our own losses were extremely heavy, but for want of exact returns I am unable to state precise numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>I think they will not be far from <measure n="1500" type="killed and wounded">1,500 killed and wounded</measure>. Nothing could exceed the coolness and determined spirit of resistance which animated the men in this long and ferocious conflict; nothing could exceed the determined courage which characterized them throughout this terrible struggle, and nothing could be more admirable than the steadiness which they exhibited until <hi rend="italics">nature</hi> itself was exhausted in what they knew to be a desperate fight against a foe very many times their superior in numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>I cannot particularize in this report to you the numberless instances of heroic daring performed by both officers and men, but must content myself for the present by saying, in my judgment, they all deserve well of the country. </p>
