<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The recent raid into <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, so far as it has developed the political opinions of the population, has confirmed the correctness of the opinion, which we have expressed several times during the past few months, that a majority of it is reliably loyal.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/> We have been accustomed to readings of wars and rumors of wars, and battles in which hosts of our follow countrymen were engaged, and in which <num value="1000">thousands</num> of them were killed or wounded, still we did not fully realize the consequences of this rebellion, in all its horrid deformities, until it has been brought to our very doors, as has been the case during the past week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>Our State, so prosperous and flourishing in all its hoarders, has been suddenly invaded by ragged and starving army from the <rs>South</rs>, which, reduced to the almost straits within the limits of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, have made a desperate effort to obtain supplies for their famishing men and horses, by a raid upon the rich fields of the <rs>Western</rs> section of our State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>The plans of the rebels, if they had any that were fully defined can only be conjectured, but whatever they may have been, they have met with disappointment and drawbacks in the carrying of them out, that has changed the whole programme which may have been marked out for them &mdash; for it is very evident that they are now more anxious to get beyond our borders than they were to cross the shallow fords of the <rs>Potomac</rs> in their advent into our State; and that the anticipation of making an entry into the <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">State of Pennsylvania</placeName> is now and forever postponed, as they find not only a powerful army pressing upon their rear, but that there was a mighty host assembled on the borders of our neighbors, with a celerity that would have done no discredit to the war chiefs of <persName n="Scotia,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00101" reg="mostcommon:Scotia,nomatch:0"><surname>Scotia</surname></persName>, when they hoisted their fire flakes upon the mountain cliffs to summon their clans to the rescue from the incursions of their ancient foes from the opposite shores of the <name>Tweed</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>Old Dominion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/> It may be considered a matter of doubt whether the rebel <rs>Generals</rs> had any definite plan of operations when they entered into <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, but probably calculated to act as circumstances might admit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>After our troops were massed behind their battlements near <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, the rebel <rs>Generals</rs> imagined that they were too much demoralized immediately to take the field; and as their army would be but wasting time to remain idle waiting for the <rs>Union</rs> forces to recruit and be reinforced, the desperate effort was determined on to make a raid into <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> to gather supplies, and if the attempt seemed feasible, to make a rush on <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, or take <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> in the rear, or even to push on to <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>They expected, also, to meet with troops of friends from among the <name>Secessionists</name> in this city and State, and that their army would thus be strengthened by the influx of the <rs>Maryland</rs> <q>&#x0022;chivalry.&#x0022;</q> who had been so long begging the <name>Confers</name> to come to their aid, promising, no doubt, what great things they were going to do when they could be backed by the rebel army on this side of the <rs>Potomac</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/> The rebels, from every account we can gather, have been woefully deceived and disappointed in the aid thus anticipated, and it is more than probable that the desertions from them have been <num value="2">two</num> to <num value="1">one</num> in excess of the additions they have received from their friends in this State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>Indeed, the evidences are, that most of those who intended to join them, when they reached their lines, and found what a miserable set of woebegone and cadaverous looking demons, in the human form, the rebel army generally speaking presented, even they could not stomach the feast before them, and the most of them retired in disgust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>The whole movement was not unlike a hap hazard attempt, such as the desperate gambler makes, staking his last dollar in despair, and prepared for the ruin staring him in the face, unless his <hi rend="italics">luck</hi> should suddenly change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>Starvation and nakedness were before the rebels, and unless they could get into <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and obtain the supplies gathered there for our army, or by a rapid stretch reach <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, and thus hold it as a hostage for their recognition, they knew that their hopes were gone, and that they could not survive the coming winter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/> The repulse with which they have met, and the lack of sympathy here, will at least assure the rebels that they have been woefully deceived by their friends in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> in their promises of aid; that the <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">State of Maryland</placeName> desired not their appearance; and those who had been making such promises of that kind of Secesh strength, calculated to meet their requirements, were merely anxious to make themselves appear of some consequence in the eyes of those from whom, hereafter, it may be necessary to seek favors. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>It is proper, then, to institute an examination into the facts of our position, in order to ascertain what real ground there may be for discouragement in the present state of affairs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/> It appears, then, that on <date value="09-14">Sunday, 14th September,</date> the <orgName>corps of <persName n="Hill,,D.,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00162" reg="default:Hill,D.,H.,,"><foreName>D.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName></orgName> was attacked by the entire force of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00163" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>; that after an obstinate resistance, <num value="1">one</num> wing was forced to give ground; that it retired slowly, fighting as it fell back, and was never routed; that it was reinforced by <persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00164" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>, recovered all it had lost, and slept upon the field of battle; that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00165" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> having come up, removed the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 2">two corps</orgName> to a position in the rear at <placeName reg="Sharpsburg, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7014501">Sharpsburg</placeName> that <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> were spent in cannonading at long taw; that on <name>Wednesday</name> a general battle was fought, in which <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00166" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> obtained a decided advantage; and that on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time>, perfectly at his leisure, he withdrew his army across the <rs>Potomac</rs>, with out being molested by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>This last fact is sufficient to prove that he could not at least have been very badly beaten; for the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> papers, anticipating such a movement, proclaimed in advance that he would certainly be destroyed in attempting to pass that river. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/> But there are other facts to show that he by no means withdrew because he was beaten.--A young officer who was in the battle of <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct>, and who came to this city <name>Sunday</name> in charge of the remains of <persName n="Starke,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00167" reg="mostcommon:Starke,William,E.,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Starke</surname></persName>, who was killed, says that our army slept on the field <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, fully expecting, and fully prepared to attack the enemy next morning; but when morning came he was nowhere to be seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>He had abandoned all his positions and left for parts unknown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>Not a man was to be seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>Scouts sent out in various directions, were unable to procure any tidings of him &mdash; The woods were shelled in all directions, but without any effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>It was evident, then, that he had gone off, in the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>He resolved to anticipate him. He therefore fell back to a position on this side of the river, where he is prepared to thwart any movement he may attempt to make Surely, there is nothing like a cheek, tar less a defeat, in all this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>On the contrary, it is evident that we ware victorious on <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>We acted on the defensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>The enemy tried a whole day to drive us from our position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>He utterly failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>We held our position, and slept on the ground, ready to renew the contest the next day He not only made no more attempts to drive us from our position, but abandoned his own in the night, with every appearance, of having despaired of beating us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>Yet <placeName reg="Monmouth, Warren, Illinois" key="tgn,2029131">Monmouth</placeName> has always been regarded as an <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>Our total loss in the battle is set down at <num value="5000">5,000</num>, probably an exaggerated estimate, which would cover the entire casualties from Sunday to <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> inclusive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>That of the enemy is stated by eye-witnesses to have been several times greater.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>It should be recollected that the great object of the operations in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> was the capture of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army of the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>That object was triumphantly accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/>The reports received yesterday are to contradictory in their nature, that in the absence of any official statement, we know not whether the army of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> is on the <rs>Northern</rs> or Southern bank of the <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Potomac</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>In our issue of yesterday, we stated upon the general reports that but reached us, that our forces had recrossed the <rs>Potomac</rs> at <placeName reg="Georgetown, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2347734">Shepherdstown</placeName> and <placeName reg="Williamsport, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7016329">Williamsport</placeName>, subsequent to the battle of <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>Later information, however, leads us to question this statement, made upon the authority of those who seemed to be conversant with the fact, and we now have reason to believe that only a portion of our forces have left <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, and that portion for a specific purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/>Of the fight of <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct>, which was doubtless <num value="1">one</num> of the most desperate and bloody of the whole war, we know but little, but that little satisfies us that at night fall the advantage remained with our cross.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>The result was favorable to us. The enemy were driven back after fighting all day, but it was hard work with us.
