<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>While this flank movement was progressing they had a severe fight with the enemy at <placeName key="tgn,2113825" n="1.000 35" reg="raccoon ford, culpeper, virginia">Raccoon Ford</placeName> on the same day, and repulsed him handsomely, reaching Brandy in time to participate in the fight with <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,R.,B.,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>It is a matter of surprise to me how <rs type="role">Gen.</rs> S. has escaped uninjured in this war.

In this charge, which has scarcely a parallel for gallantry and for the handsome manner in which it was executed, <rs type="role">Gen.</rs> G. had the heel of <num value="1">one</num> of his boots shot away, and a spent ball struck him a hard blow on the side of his nose. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> In speaking of individual heroism, I cannot fail to mention the name of <persName n="Haines,Captain,T.,W.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00033" reg="default:Haines,T.,W.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Haines</surname></persName>, commanding <orgName type="company" n="Company H">company H</orgName>. <orgName type="regiment" key="9VACav">9th Virginia cavalry</orgName>, who was severely wounded at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> while gallantly leading his sharp shooters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>We are to be pressed up into a small space, and annihilated before the mud comes on &mdash; that is before the <date value="12-01">first of December.</date> We should probably feel some degree of alarm at these terrible threats had we not heard them <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> ago, just before <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00195" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> advanced upon <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> and stopped at <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, and <persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00196" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><surname>Meade</surname></persName> advanced upon <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> to fall back on <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>Indeed, we do not think the trumpets are sounded quite so fiercely now as they were on that occasion, and seeing that such is the fact, we take heart of grace, and comfort ourselves with the musty old proverb that &#x0022;threatened men live long.&#x0022;--It would not surprise us at all to hear that we had given the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> a thrashing all around before the <date value="12-01">first of December.</date> Before the advance of <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00197" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> we were assured by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> newspapers that the rebellion would be crushed by that time.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/> There was a time when the proclamations of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00199" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> for more men had something alarming in them for the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>That time has past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>They are now always received with pleasure, because they are regarded as so many acknowledgments of defeat, and by consequence so many evidences of weakness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>After every Confederate victory we hear of them, but they are no longer followed by a general rush of whole populations to the field as they were when they were yet a novelty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>The last call for <num value="300000">300,000</num> men was successful to the extent of raising <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> of the number called for. The present call, notwithstanding the heavy premium offered, is not likely to be more so. <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00200" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> began the war with volunteers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>They were killed off so rapidly that each succeeding call yielded fewer men than that which had preceded it. At last he was compelled to resort to a draft, and he has tried that expedient until it has been worn out, and ceases to have the desired effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>Now he falls back upon his original scheme of a volunteer force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>There is in this proceeding a strong proof that both methods have failed, and he can possibly resort to no other. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/> The time at which this new call is resorted to is significant enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>Most of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army was enlisted, or drafted, or volunteered for <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>. The time of nearly all of them expires next <rs type="season">spring</rs> or <rs type="season">summer</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>At least <num value="300000">three hundred thousand</num> troops will then go out of service, and the present call is doubtless intended to meet that emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>How far <num value="300000">three hundred thousand</num> recruits, even if they can be brought out, are capable of filling the places of the same number of veterans, inured to all the hardships and dangers of war, it is hardly necessary to inquire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>But can he get them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>Now that the elections in <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> and <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName> are over, we should not be surprised to hear that he had succeeded in doing so by drafting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>But they will after all but fill up the gap in the ranks left by the retirement of the old soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>He will get very few by volunteering, we venture to predict because the materials out of which his volunteers were formerly made are pretty well exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>The <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> and <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs>, as we have before taken occasion to remark, can now get a plenty of employment in New York and the other cities, whereas before there was no work for them to do, and they volunteered to escape starvation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/> The declaration of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00201" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> that his object is to &#x0022;reinforce our victorious armies in the field,&#x0022; is ludicrous enough in view of the actual facts, and will impose upon nobody. --The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation, of all other nation, is the last to be cheated into danger by any such clap-trap declamation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>Indeed, <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00202" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> has done his worst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>He can never, hereafter, do us as much harm as he has done heretofore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>We have seen and felt the full extent of his power, and, with the assistance of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, we have been enabled to withstand it without so much as flinching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>If he has failed to subdue us heretofore, he cannot do it hereafter, ever with the assistance of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, which, under the auspices of <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName>, seems to have thrown off the mask and come forth as our avowed enemy.
