<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/> Judicious rules should be established for the protection and removal of at least the male slaves from those portions of the <rs>State</rs> that are surrendered to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>The labor of the slaves in needed for many purposes connected with the operations and movements of the army, and they could be employed advantageously and profitably both to the master and to the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>If the male slaves were withdrawn with the army, the enemy would have no labor with which to cultivate the land, or which they could apply to any other practical use. And besides, if the males were withdrawn, the females and the children would most probably remain, as the labor of these latter would not compensate the enemy for their maintenance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/> The loss to the citizens of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> in the item of slave property alone far exceeds the loss from the destruction of cotton, or any other species of property, during the war. --Counties in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> have been overrun, containing an aggregate slave population of <num value="80728">80,728</num>, by the late census, and which, at a moderate valuation, is worth in round numbers, <measure n="15000dollars" type="currency">$15,000 000</measure>. Such a loss should not be permitted to fail upon a people, if it can by any proper means be prevented. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/> If, therefore, our officers, when there is reason to believe that they will be compelled to abandon a position, would notify the owners of slaves to remove them, or report them at camp for the performance of such service as may be assigned to them, a most severe loss in this particular property would be avoided. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/> The war now in progress must be prosecuted with energy and spirit; but this may be done, and proper attention may at the same time be given to the development of the abundant and rich resources of the <rs>State</rs>.--Our material <unclear>in </unclear> are important, and should be closed <unclear></unclear> after.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>In giving proper attention to them, and by following the example set us by our ancestors of Revolutionary history, we can do much to aid the common cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>We have scattered throughout the <rs>State</rs> vast deposits of saltpetre, which have been but partially developed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>We have the means within reach of supplying the demand for salt from our salt springs and the seaboard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>We have the means and materials for the manufacture of gunpowder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>We have rich mines of lead and copper and iron are, to be found at various points in the <rs>State</rs>, and which, if judiciously and energetically managed and worked, are capable of supplying the wants of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/> The question then arises, what is necessary to be done to render all these articles of prime necessity immediately available?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>In <dateStruct value="1775--"><year reg="1775">1775</year></dateStruct>, <dateStruct value="1773--"><year reg="1773">1773</year></dateStruct>, and <dateStruct value="1777--"><year reg="1777">1777</year></dateStruct>, our forefathers passed ordinances providing for working the lead mines in <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName> and other counties; for procuring saltpetre and sulphur, and stimulating the manufacture of gunpowder; for encouraging the manufacture of salt and designating the places at which it was to be made, and for encouraging the manufacture of arms and ammunition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>The mode adopted was the payment of proper bounties &mdash; such, for example, as <measure n="50cents" type="currency">fifty cents</measure> per pound (bounty) for salty <unclear> re,</unclear> and <measure n="16cents" type="currency">sixteen cents</measure> per pound for sulphur, when used in the manufacture of gunpowder. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/> The legislation of these periods is deeply interesting, and much of it is applicable to our own times, and might with great propriety be re-enacted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>The parallel between the <unclear></unclear> complained of at that day and those with which we are afflicted now, is most striking and complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>I regret that I have not the space (without extending this paper to an unwarrantable length,) to quote their denunciations of extortioners and speculators &mdash; by no means a small class at the present day. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/> Our railways and their machinery are subjects for serious consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>We have neither the material for the reconstruction of the roads nor the mechanical skill for the reconstruction of the machinery, nor can we procure them from abroad under existing circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>These questions, therefore, address themselves with unusual force to the consideration of the <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/> I recommend that the speed of railway travel shall be regulated by law, as the only means of preserving our improvements from absolute and early destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>High rates of speed <unclear> end</unclear> greatly to accelerate the wear and tear of both the roadway and machinery Passenger trains now pass at the speed of about <measure n="16miles" type="distance">sixteen miles</measure> per hour, and freight trains at a speed of about <measure n="12miles" type="distance">twelve miles</measure> per hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>This speed should be reduced to <measure n="10miles" type="distance">ten miles</measure> per hour for passenger trains, and <measure n="8miles" type="distance">eight miles</measure> per hour for freight trains, unless in cases of great public necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>Such an arrangement would prolong the existence of both roads and machinery. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/> I am informed by gentlemen of experience and observation, who have given great attention to the subject, that the life of an English or Weish rail cannot be safely estimated at more than <measure n="12years" type="date">twelve years</measure>; that <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> of the rails in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> have been laid down, at least <measure n="8years" type="date">eight years</measure>; and that <num value="19">nineteen</num> twentieths of them are of English or <persName n="Welsh,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00136" reg="mostcommon:Welsh,nomatch:0"><surname>Welsh</surname></persName> production, made for sale, and received without inspection as to quality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>Such is the present evidence of wear in the rails that it may be safely affirmed that if iron could be imported every <orgName n="Railroad Company" type="company">railroad company</orgName> would be purchasers to the full extent of their ability to pay, and many would attempt to negotiate on time, such is the pressing necessity for new rails to repair the dilapidated sections of the road ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>The weight of trains should be diminished, and all freight with the passenger trains should be prohibited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>Immense quantities of freight are now transported at the speed of passenger travel, under the name of <q>&#x0022;express freight,&#x0022;</q> to the great injury of the railways, and to the benefit of no <num value="1">one</num> except the stockholders of the <orgName n="Express Company" type="company">express company</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/> I recommend, therefore, that these suggestions be reduced to laws, so that all railroads may be placed upon the same footing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>The necessity of legislation is apparent, as we must have uniform laws with regard to speed on our roads, and uniform laws with regard to express freight, to avoid complaint against the roads that may be willing to adopt the arrangement. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/> Our railroads gone, we shall be seriously embarrassed; and I therefore call the attention of the <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName> to the subject, as <num value="1">one</num> worthy of the most serious consideration and prompt and decided action. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/> The report of the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant General</rs>, presenting abstracts of the returns of the militia enrolled under the act of <date value="1862-02-08">February 8th, 1862,</date> and returns of the active volunteer force, under the act of <date value="1862-02-10">February 10th, 1862,</date> is herewith presented for the information of the <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>[Appendix A.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/> I call your attention to the defects in the laws relating to exemptions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>If conclusions can be drawn from the reports that have been made to the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant General</rs>, we have too much reason to believe that in many instances the law has been grossly a bused, and multitudes have been released from military service who have no just claim to exemption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>The applicants have been allowed to select the physicians who were to examine them; and it has been no unusual sight to see the court-houses occupied by physicians receiving fees for furnishing certificates of <q> &#x0022;disability.&#x0022;</q>--The certificates thus obtained, when presented to the boards, in most instances, have been taken as sufficient to justify the exemption of the applicant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>These applicants should be re-examined by a disinterested surgeon, who is not to receive fees, and who should be sworn before he enters upon the discharge of his duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>All men capable of doing so, are squally bound to render military service, and all should be willing to render it at a time like the present. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>The report shows that we have issued <num value="39">thirty-nine</num> pieces of artillery, <num value="6">six</num> and <num value="12">twelve</num> pounders, and <num value="16774">sixteen thousand seven hundred and seventy-four</num> small arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>[Appendix B.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/> On the night of the <date value="04-21">21st of April</date> last, a mutiny of a very serious character was attempted by a large number of the prisoners in the penitentiary, who had, by the means of false keys, released themselves from their calls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>So soon as I was informed of the fact, I directed an investigation to be made; and the report of the <rs>Superintendent</rs>, accompanied by the evidence taken in pursuance of that order, is herewith communicated for your consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>[Appendix C] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/> This attempt, participated in by so large a number of the more desperate of the prisoners, must have been the result of much conference and discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>The keys must have been made in the penitentiary; and the fact that the pistols of the interior guard had been tempered with, and when the mutiny was discovered were found until for service, shows that there has been the most culpable negligence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>It has been apparent, for some time, that the discipline has not been as rigid as it should have been in an institution of this kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>For some time past the raw material for the several workshops has been supplied in very limited quantities, and the consequence has been that the convicts have been idle much of the time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/> I communicate also the testimony taken by <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> the officers of the <orgName n="Public Guard" type="guard">Public Guard</orgName> relating to the same subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>[Appendix D.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/> I trust it will be the pleasure of the <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName> to institute a searching investigation, and to adopt such legislation as will insure rigid discipline and a better system of management, not only in procuring supplies, but in conducting the shops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>With judicious management, the institution would pay well &mdash; without it, it must remain, as it has been, a burden upon the <rs>State</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/> The number of convicts now in the institution is very large &mdash; as many as <num value="3">three</num>, and in some instances more, being confined in the same cell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>It is important that the establishment should be enlarged, or some other mode adopted to secure rellof in this respect. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/> In my message of <date value="1861-01">January, 1861,</date> I presented a recommendation on this subject; which I now respectfully renew: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/> &#x0022;I suggest also that you so amend the criminal laws as to prohibit any person from being confined in the penitentiary for a shorter period than <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>. It requires at least <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> to acquire a trade; and those who are confined for a shorter period are a burden to the institution and an expense to the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>In all such cases let some other punishment be substituted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>The ends of justice would be as well accomplished &mdash; perhaps better &mdash; and the treasury would be relieved from an onerous and unnecessary burden.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/> A very large number of convicts are sent to the penitentiary for short terms; and such labor as we can get from them falls far short of compensating <unclear></unclear> State for their support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>And besides, I think it may be very safely affirmed, that a convict who remains in the institution too short a term to enable him to acquire a useful trade, is in a worse condition when discharged than when he entered the prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>When discharged, they should be able to obtain an honest living, by prosecuting an honorable trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>If they have no trade, they are turned out upon the world without the means of making a livelihood, and they naturally and necessarily relapse into their old habits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>The object of punishment is reformation, and all legislation relating to offenders and crimes should be directed to the accomplishment of this wise end. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/> I recommend the repeal of section <num value="27" type="ordinal">twenty-seventh</num> of chapter <num value="44">forty-four</num> of the <name>Code</name>.--This section directs that every canceled certificate of debt shall remain filed in the <rs>Treasurer</rs>'s office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>I recommend also the repeal of section <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> of ordinance <num value="35">number thirty-five</num>, passed <date value="1861-04-30">April 30th, 1861.</date> This section requires the <name>Treasury</name> notes, as they are redeemed by the <rs>Auditor</rs>, to be canceled by him, and delivered to the <rs>Treasurer</rs>, to be preserved in his office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>Lists of the notes issued, as well as of those redeemed and canceled, are required to be kept; and this, it seems to me, accomplishes all that is necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>All these evidences of debt and Treasury notes can be destroyed, without prejudice to the interests of individuals or of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>These papers are in the way in the <rs>Treasurer</rs>'s office, and the <rs>Auditor</rs> and Treasurer should be instructed to destroy them without delay. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/> The same recommendation is made as to the <name>Treasury</name> notes issued under the act of <dateStruct value="1856--"><year reg="1856">1856</year></dateStruct>, which are also deposited in the <rs>Treasurer</rs>'s office. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/> I recommend, therefore, that you shall by law authorize the sale of the stocks now in the <rs>Treasurer</rs>'s keeping belonging to these <num value="2">two</num> institutions, and deposit the proceeds in the treasury for the redemption of their circulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>This will operate justly for the note- holders, and will adequately protect their interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>I recommend also that the <rs>Treasurer</rs> be directed to notify the note-holders to present their notes within <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> for redemption, or they will be barred of all participation in the fund realized from the sale of the stocks belonging to those institutions. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>Of the remaining counties which were not in the possession of he enemy at the time the vote was cast, verbal accounts represent that a considerable additional vote against the ratification of the <rs>Constitution</rs> was given, which would increase the majority; but though steps wore taken to obtain the returns, they have not been received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>The majority for its rejection, therefore, is <num value="678">six hundred and seventy-eight</num> votes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>A clause providing for gradual <unclear> cipation</unclear> was also submitted at the same time, and rejected by the popular vote &mdash; What makes these results the more significant is the fact that all soldiers, no matter whether citizens of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> or not, were allowed to <unclear>yo </unclear> as I learn; and in spite of this extraordinary proceeding, the public judgment was pronounced against both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/> There is much misunderstanding with regard to the sentiments and position of our people in <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>; and it would be unpardonable in me to permit this occasion to pass, without vindicating them in the eyes of my countrymen of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.
