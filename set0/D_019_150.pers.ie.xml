<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Has the editor of the aforesaid newspaper ever read the history of the earlier stages of the war of independence?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>It so, has he forgotten that a certain <persName n="Washington,,George,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="default:Washington,George,,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName>, a notorious rebel against the <rs>British Crown</rs>, was similarly menaced with death as a traitor, if he could only be caught?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>And that Lords This, That, and The Other, issued proclamations, declaring that every single colonist taken with arms in his hands was guilty of undoubted felony, and would be hung?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/><placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> did not effect to deny the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>He justified it as having been forced upon <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> by <name>British</name> despatism &mdash; not the tithe as, bitter as the <rs>South</rs> has groaned under at the hands of the <name>Abolitionists</name> of the <rs>North</rs>--and in answer to the threat that his soldiers should be executed, contented himself with solemnly assuring the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs> of the <name>Tory</name> army that where the latter hung <num value="1">one</num> man, he would string up <num value="2">two</num>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> The Lincoln Government affects to regard every single individual who has taken up arms to defend Southern soil from invasion, as punishable by hanging, and all who have aided them or rendered them comfort as guilty of misprision or treason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>At least <num value="400000">four hundred thousand</num> individuals ought, under such teaching, to be led to the gallows tomorrow, and the remainder of the population of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> should be subjected to fine and imprisonment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>This is, substantially, the doctrine held by all of our leading Abolitionists, although, when the time for carrying their threats into effect comes, a certain instinct of self-preservation whispers in their cars that the chalice they so recklessly hold up to others may, later, be returned to their own lips.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>If they were thoroughly consistent, they would not rest contented, unless each prisoner captured were visited with an ignominious death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>They should either directly advocate such brutality, or else they should cease to impose their reckless clamor upon the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/><rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> have been accustomed to express sympathy with <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italians</rs>, Hungarians, and even Sepoys in a state of insurrection, condemning, as worthy of perpetual infamy, rulers who have decreed the penalty of the law upon their subjects; but never under any foreign nationality &mdash; not within the most barbarous Turkish Pashaliks &mdash; have theories of punishment been promulgated, so ferocious and savage as those which have formed the staple of <rs n="Republican" type="political">republican</rs> ravings since the middle of <dateStruct value="-04-"><month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/> <num value="1">One</num> of the most painful phenomena of these dark and distracted times, is the effort that is being made by the autocracy at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and its organs elsewhere, to discourage every tendency to kindly, conciliatory, or peaceful feelings toward the <rs>Southern States</rs>, and to create such embitterment between the <num value="2">two</num> sections as may render a future settlement of difficulties impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The comparatively mild policy of <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> in <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> has been condemned, although a contrary course must inevitably lead to a local guerilla warfare of the most deplorable description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Murderous attacks upon women and children, and the slaughter of innocent citizens in a Court of Justice, and massacres like that of <placeName reg="Boonville, Cooper, Missouri" key="tgn,2058115">Booneville</placeName>, excite the jubilant applause of the demoniacs who hold the destinies of the country in their hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Emulating the <name>Robespierres</name> and Marats of the <name>Reign</name> of Terror, they scent out the possibility of sacrificing life with a keen, blood-hound instinct, as cowardly as it is barbarous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>No patriotic consideration will bring them to their senses, but they will soon be checked by their own fears, when those retaliations have commenced on Southern soil, which are inevitable, if the recommendation of a general resort to capital punishment is carried into execution. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/> In accordance with international law, it has been officially declared by no less than <num value="2">two</num> ex-Chancellors of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, as well as by the present <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Chancellor</foreName></persName>, that privateering is not piracy, and that to punish it as such would be murder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> occupy a position as a <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">de facto</hi></foreign> Government, which the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> would instantly recognize, did they hold their present relation to any other Power besides itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/><placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> have both recognized them as belligerents, and, not improbably, both of these countries will, ere long, assume an attitude, in their behalf, hostile to ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>The blockade of the <rs>Southern</rs> coast, which has been unconstitutionally proclaimed by the <rs>President</rs>, is almost exclusively maintained by vessels, as much privateers as the <name>Savannahs</name> and, therefore, equally liable to be considered pirates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>If secession is unlawful, so has been the invasion of States, the closing of sea-ports, the massacre of citizens, the enforcement of martial law, the raising of armies, the infringement of the <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus,</hi> the violation of telegraphic dispatches, and a <num value="100">hundred</num> daily iniquities that are unscrupulously perpetrated with the sanction or under the orders of the <name>Administration</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>If Southern privateers are to be hung, such havoc will be made among Northern prisoners of war as will cause the <name>Abolition</name> demagogues who are inciting Government to such cruel folly, to tremble at the consequences of their ill-digested, bloody counsels. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>The farmers have yet on their hands very large quantities, in the aggregate, of rye, corn and cats.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/> Consequently, with all the elements of prosperity in their possession, they cannot realize money value, on account of the present depressed state of business, caused by the war. The farmers, then, in this way, are paying a direct tax. Those who were loudest, a few weeks ago, in their clamor for war, now hold their tongues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>They will soon cry peace; they have now no objection to others doing so.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/> It is a fact that after the <name>Presidential</name> election <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abe,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> himself was so far from considering himself elected by the national preference that he entered <placeName reg="District of Columbia" key="tgn,7013962">Washington City</placeName> furtively, in order to escape, as he pretended, from certain infernal plots &mdash; which plots, it is evident, only existed in his own weak brain. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>But the refusal of these States to respond to this appeal of their indulgent father angered him to such an extent that he soon after called on his Northern friends for <num value="75000">75,000</num> troops in order to treat the <rs>South</rs> as rebellions. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>He proposed to punish them severely, and having doubtless little confidence in his <num value="75000">75,000</num> volunteers, he decrees under his individual authority a regular army of <num value="45000">45,000</num> men, overleaping utterly the restrictions of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, which forbid such an act!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>And those very New York papers which were foremost in exposing his fallacies, have been insane enough to join the bue and cry of the present wicked and senseless war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>It threw back at once upon the <rs>Northern</rs> market the surplus of potatoes, onions, apples, corn, hay, butter and cheese which Northern farmers had sold at the <rs>South</rs>, and the innumerable fabrics of cotton, linen, wool, leather, metal, glass, clay, &#x0026;c., which it had taken from Northern workshops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>It is needless to say that the financial revulsion in the <rs>North</rs> which must follow this suicidal war upon its own interests, will surpass the most gigantic disaster of the kind that has ever been witnessed in modern times. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/> <hi rend="italics">To the <name>Editors</name> of the <name>Dispatch</name>:</hi>--What has surprised me more than anything else in these days of exaggeration, when every little skirmish is magnified into a battle, is that so little has been thought of the repeated attacks upon, and, in particular, the <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> terrific cannonade of, the little sand-bag battery at <placeName reg="Game Point, Skagway-Yakutat-Angoon, Alaska" key="tgn,2344167">Game Point</placeName>, Aquia <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">Creek</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>For so glorious a result, with such means of resistance to the attacking force, I know nothing to be compared to it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/> The main cause, perhaps, of this under-valuation, (to use a mercantile phrase,) may be attributed to the unsatisfactory official report, which gave a brief account, as of nothing extraordinary, of what was indeed a glorious victory. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/> I happened to be at the <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">Creek</rs> on the evening when the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attack was made by a single steamer, since ascertained to be the <rs>Freeborn</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>This attack, as I heard an officer say, was evidently only designed to get the range of our guns, as only about a dozen shots were exchanged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/><num value="1">One</num> of the enemy's rified shells passed through the redoubt and exploded in the officers' quarters, beneath the <rs>Captain</rs>'s bed, and demolished everything in the apartment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>By the fragment of another shell, <num value="1">one</num> man was slightly wounded in the hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>This was the only casualty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/> It was taken for granted that another attack would be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>I went the following day to the <rs type="place">Point</rs>, but everything was quiet, excepting that our boys were busy strengthening their redoubt, by throwing up additional quantities of sand in front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>The next day (<dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>) I again rode over after breakfast, and had no sooner reached the range of hills which overlook the point, than I saw that something interesting was about to take place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>In addition to the <rs>Freeborn</rs>, there were <num value="2">two</num> other armed steamers, <num value="1">one</num> of them, however, a small tug, which were evidently preparing for an attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>Soon after <time value="10oclock">10 o'clock</time> they approached and opened fire, which was steadily returned by our battery of <num value="2">two</num> guns. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/> In about half an hour after the action began, the <orgName n="Purcell Battery" type="battery">Purcell battery</orgName>, of <num value="4">four</num> small rified guns, was brought to the height near which I stood, and opened upon the enemy, and some of its shot must have struck him, for he immediately returned its fire, and did so from time to time while the fight lasted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/> In the meantime the shot were flying into and the shell were bursting over our little battery on the point, and several times we thought that it was destroyed; but when our fears had grown almost to certainties, the boom of the gun would tell that our defenders maintained their post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>About <time value="1:30">half-past 1</time> the enemy withdrew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>Our men were wholly unhurt; what injury the enemy sustained we could not tell; but it must have been considerable, as he was repeatedly struck. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/> Soon after the fight, <num value="1">one</num> of the steamers went up the river; it was supposed to procure assistance, and the supposition proved correct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> a large <num value="3">three</num>-masted steamer, which proved to be the <rs n="Pawnee" type="nativeamerican">Pawnee</rs>, mounting <num value="14">14</num> heavy guns, had joined the squadron of the day before, and all were evidently preparing for an attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>The manner in which our men had maintained their post the day before satisfied me that they would do their best; but I regarded their annihilation as certain when I looked upon the over whelming force arrayed against them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/> Owing, it was said, to the small amount of ammunition, the <orgName n="Purcell Battery" type="battery">Purcell battery</orgName> was not this day brought into action, but <num value="1">one</num> of the guns was placed in the <name>Game</name> <orgName n="Point Battery" type="battery">Point battery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>Only think--<num value="2">two</num> large and <num value="1">one</num> small rified gun, looking like a <num value="6">6</num>-pounder, against <num value="4">four</num> steamers, <num value="1">one</num> with <num value="14">14</num> guns, heavier than those in the battery, and the others carrying as many in the aggregate &mdash; some of them rified ones. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/> Just before the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, shot was fired, the building at the extremity of the wharf was set on fire and the bridge leading to it blown up by the defenders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>Between <num value="11">11</num> and <num value="12">12</num> the battle began, and continued for <num value="5">five</num> mortal hours; and when the cannonade and the conflagration were at their height, the grandest spectacle was exhibited which I have ever seen or expect to see, and I wish that every lover of the sublime could have been there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>The incessant flashes through a sheet of flame, the eddying smoke, and the hiss and whiz of ball and shell hurling and bursting in the air, with the loud reports reverberating among the hills, made us, as I have said, tremble for the little band which was literally girdled with fire. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/> But there was a flag-staff beside the redoubt, and our hearts were cheered as, from time to time, through the lifting smoke, we saw that our flag was triumphantly waving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/><q>&#x0022;Poor fellows!&#x0022;</q> we exclaimed, again and again, as a shell burst apparently in the very midst of the battery; but, in a moment, the report of a gun would tell that though, at least, were left to defend it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/> The enemy hauled off, leaving a partially demolished sand-bank, with its defenders unscathed behind it. His loss must have been severe as evinced by the number of times he was struck and the precipitation of his retreat &mdash; a retreat which received a salute of <num value="3">three</num> cheers and a parting shot from the little garrison. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/> For the disparity of force, and the quantity of ammunition expended by the enemy in so brief a space of time, the defence of <placeName reg="Game Point, Skagway-Yakutat-Angoon, Alaska" key="tgn,2344167">Game Point</placeName> I consider unparalelled in the annals of modern warfare. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/> To sum up the injury known to have been sustained by the enemy, the <rs>Anacosta</rs> was so much injured that the carpenters who surveyed her pronounce that she cannot be repaired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>The <rs n="Pawnee" type="nativeamerican">Pawnee</rs> is admitted to have been <num value="8">eight</num> times struck--<num value="1">one</num> of them a raking shot, which dismounted <num value="2">two</num> of her guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>The <rs>Freeborn</rs> took up <measure n="21" type="dead">twenty-one dead</measure> bodies.--Among them, it is reported that of the <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-2">2d Lieutenant</rs> of the <rs n="Pawnee" type="nativeamerican">Pawnee</rs>--and there were upwards of <measure n="50" type="wounded">fifty wounded</measure>--among them, the <rs>Commander</rs> of the latter vessel. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/> <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> our town was thrown into great commotion by a rumor being spread that a secret expedition was forming, whose object was unknown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>Men were seen gathering in small groups at the corners of the streets, conversing on this all-absorbing topic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>Some <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure> previously, a gentleman of the name of <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00276" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,R.,,,"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName> was seen about the streets with his head shaved very close and dressed in the <rs>Zouave</rs> style.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>He attracted upon himself universal observation, and was even suspected by some of being a spy. He was evidently affecting a character very adverse to his true <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>He, it has since been ascertained, is a native of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>He had learned that the <rs>St. Nicholas</rs> was soon to start from that port to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and had come on to concert with <persName n="Hollins,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00277" reg="nearbymention:Hollins,George,N.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Hollins</surname></persName> a most perilous and important expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>The object of the expedition was no less than the capture of the <name>Pawnes</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>It was to have been accomplished as follows, and nothing but a stroke of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> could have made them fall of their object: </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>So when they were at the month of the <rs>Potomac</rs>, at a preconcerted signal his men rose up, took possession of the steamer, and steering straight for the month of <placeName reg="Kern-Kaweah River, Tulare, California" key="tgn,2435434">Cone River</placeName>, they soon reached the place pre-arranged as the point where the <name>Tennesseeans</name> were to join them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>He then returned to the bay and scoured it, capturing the following prizes in addition to the <rs>St. Nicholas</rs>; a vessel laden with <measure n="3500bags" type="mass">3,500 bags</measure> of coffee, another laden with ice, and <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> with coal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>They have all been brought within the protection of our batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>The St. Nicholas with <num value="1">one</num> of the vessels is in sight of our wharf. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/> This success has illuminated the countenances of our townsmen with exceeding joy. Their anxious and care-worn faces of yesterday are lit up with a luminous expression of joy and satisfaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>From the accounts which have reached me, I judge the enemy numbered about <num value="50">fifty</num>, and landed for the purpose of erecting some kind of defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>The accounts are so vague that I am unwilling to give any statement positively, except that of the number killed and the quantity of implements found in the deserted boat.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/> Our citizens were thrown into quite a furor of excitement yesterday afternoon, about <time value="6.5oclock">6 &#x00BD; o'clock</time>, by the arrival at the wharf of the <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">St. Nicholas</rs>, of the <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> and <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> line, and at a very late hour of the night the wharf was crowded with those dubious about her identity, and curious to know the circumstances under which she came. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/> For several days past, the town has been highly excited with curiosity about the secret expedition which left here <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, and even now the excitement of the ignorant in regard to it has not abated in the least.--The arrival of this steamer was the cause, very naturally, of alarm to some, while it increased the intense curicsity of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>The circumstances connected with her transfer <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> from the <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> and <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> line to <num value="1">one</num> of the ports of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, may be summed up as follows: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/> The <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">St. Nicholas</rs> left the wharf at <persName n="Thursday,,Baltimore,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00287" reg="default:Thursday,Baltimore,,,"><foreName>Baltimore</foreName> <surname>Thursday</surname></persName>, about <time value="1pm">1 o'clock P.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>When she reached <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Maryland</rs> capes the <rs>Captain</rs> and crew suddenly found themselves in the hands of some &#x0022;Rebels,&#x0022; and were necessarily obliged to surrender in the name of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>Resistance was useless, and the <rs>Captain</rs>, seeing how futile would be any such attempt, quietly submitted to being deposed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/> The gentleman who conducted this affair deserves a great deal of credit, and it is only for important considerations (which he will understand) that I can forbear calling his name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>He will receive the reward due him from another and more pleasing source. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/> The steamer, after undergoing a change of commanders and crew, proceeded to <placeName reg="Kern-Kaweah River, Tulare, California" key="tgn,2435434">Cone river</placeName> to await reinforcements and to execute the remainder of the mission for which she was captured; but owing to some mismanagement or misunderstanding, was compelled to leave undone the most important part of the programme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>She left <placeName reg="Kern-Kaweah River, Tulare, California" key="tgn,2435434">Cone river</placeName> <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, and while proceeding down the <rs type="place">Bay</rs> to the mouth of the <placeName reg="Rappahannock, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1129010">Rappahannock</placeName>, <measure n="2" type="captured">captured two</measure> schooners--<num value="1">one</num> named <persName><foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName>, of New York, ladened with coal from <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>, to <placeName key="tgn,7022656" n="1.000 86" reg="staten island, new york, kings">Staten Island</placeName>; the other, <persName n="Pierce,,Mary,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00288" reg="default:Pierce,Mary,,,"><foreName>Mary</foreName> <surname>Pierce</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, ladened with <num value="268">268</num> tons of ice, for <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>The latter proves a very valuable acquisition, as our stock of ice is growing very small.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>The Virginia captured a schooner, the name of which I could not learn, ladened with coffee, from <persName n="Rio,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00289" reg="mostcommon:Rio,nomatch:0"><surname>Rio</surname></persName>, for <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>; and, as the neutrality of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> has been recognized, I presume her cargo will be purchased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>The <rs>Captain</rs> of the <term type="ship">schooner</term> <rs type="ship">Margaret</rs> is a <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginian</rs>, and should be dealt with as he deserves.
