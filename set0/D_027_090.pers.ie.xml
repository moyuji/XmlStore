<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>He knew, as all Southern statesmen knew, that unless the rights of the <name>States</name> could be preserved, the preservation of the <rs>Union</rs> was impossible; and he saw, what too many Southern statesmen overlooked, that a party was forming in the <rs>North</rs>, whose <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> principle was deadly and decided hostility to those rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>The measures which he proposed to arrest the progress of this party were misinterpreted, and he fell under the odium which once attached to the name of disunionist. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/> Nor was he altogether singular in his fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>Among other illustrious Southern men who fell under the same suspicion was the late <persName n="Floyd,,John,B.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00169" reg="default:Floyd,John,B.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName>, the hereditary friend and confidant of <persName n="Calhoun,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00170" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName>, and the man, of all others, who best comprehended his views and the ends which he proposed to accomplish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>For, as it was said of old, &#x0022;they are not all <placeName key="tgn,1000119" n="1.000 3" reg="yisra'el">Israel</placeName> that are of <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName>;&#x0022; so it was not every admirer, and even follower, of <persName n="Calhoun,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00171" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName> who fully comprehended his principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>The reason of the failure is sufficiently obvious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>The intellect of <persName n="Calhoun,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00172" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName> was the most subtle, we are prone to believe, ever accorded to a human being, unless <persName><foreName>Aristotle</foreName></persName> and <persName n="Hobbes,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00173" reg="mostcommon:Hobbes,nomatch:0"><surname>Hobbes</surname></persName> may contest the palm with him. He possessed a rapidity of analysis that eluded the grasp and defied the attention of the most acute and most untiring listener.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>His speeches are all remarkable for their power of condensation, their almost scornful rejection of ornament, and the acuteness of the logic which pervades them, and renders them dissimilar to any others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/><num value="1">One</num> of the most eminent lawyers that <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> ever produced &mdash; a man whose acuteness of intellect was considered something like a prodigy in his day &mdash; is understood to have declared that he found the greatest difficulty in following <persName n="Calhoun,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00174" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName>'s train of thought through <num value="1">one</num> of his speeches.--Each speech was as comprehensive as a volume, and many volumes might have been formed out of any half dozen of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>He could be better comprehended when they were published than while they were in the course of delivery, because it could then be seen how much thought he had packed into how small a space.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>They remind us of the treatise of equity, which goes under the name of Fonblauque, but was really written by a man named <persName n="Ballow,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00175" reg="mostcommon:Ballow,nomatch:0"><surname>Ballow</surname></persName>, in which the whole science of equity is dispatched in about <num value="100">one hundred</num> pages, and that so completely and comprehensively, that the hundreds of volumes published on the subject since, contain nothing more than elaborations of the principles there laid down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>It was not wonderful, therefore, that <persName n="Calhoun,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00176" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Calhoun</surname></persName>, while he had many admirers, had few friends that could grasp his views.

He felt that, unless some means could be discovered of arresting the progress of the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> party, the <rs>Union</rs> must inevitably be overthrown; for he saw that they were determined to push matters to the last extremity, and to leave the <rs>South</rs> no room to retreat, or to save so much even as its honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>He was devoted to the <rs>Union</rs>, and he cast about for some method by which it might be possible to rally and re-unite the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>A war with some foreign power suggested itself as the only remedy, and, desperate as this was, he did not hesitate to recommend its adoption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>This, we learn from authority which we believe to be undoubted, <persName n="Floyd,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00181" reg="nearbymention:Floyd,John,B.,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName> himself stated in the latter days of his life.--He used every exertion to bring on a war with <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>; and as our readers may probably recollect, the war was very near coming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>It would have come but for the want of pluck on the part of Old Buck, who could not be brought up to the fighting point by all the arguments, entreaties and persuasions of which <persName n="Floyd,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00182" reg="nearbymention:Floyd,John,B.,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName> was master &mdash; and he was master of as many of each as most men. He failed completely, and he saw at a glance that there was no longer the vestige of a hope for the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>He immediately, upon reaching this conclusion, set to work to do the best he could for his own section, since he knew that the war was to be sectional.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>Can anybody but a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> blame him? </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/> A great superfluity of arms and munitions of war had been collected in the arsenals and depots of the <orgName n="U. S. Congress" type="Congress">United States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>The <rs>Secretary</rs> was never accused of withholding its <hi rend="italics">quota</hi> from the <rs>North</rs>, but it wanted <hi rend="italics">all.</hi> That he determined it should not have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>It would have been entitled to it under no circumstances whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>Under circumstances which he knew to exist, it would have been a crime a little worse than <persName n="Arnold,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00184" reg="mostcommon:Arnold,nomatch:0"><surname>Arnold</surname></persName>'s had he gratified its cupidity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>He felt no inclination to prove a traitor, and a traitor he would have been to the <rs>State</rs> to which his allegiance was due, and to the whole Southern country, had he given the <rs>North</rs> all it required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>He did no such thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>He sent to the <rs>South</rs> the full sum total in arms, munitions and equipments to which she was entitled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>A yell of rage burst from the battled wolves of the <rs>Northern</rs> press.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>He was denounced as a traitor from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> to the river <rs>St. John</rs>'s; from <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> to Mormondom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>A traitor to what?--To that agency forsooth which our fathers set up to conduct our foreign affairs, but which had now set <hi rend="italics">itself</hi> up to be a sovereign, usurping all the functions of the <name>States</name>--the only true sovereigns on this part of the continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>He laughed their anger to scorn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>He boldly avowed that he had sent cannon to the <rs>South</rs>, and powder and ball to load them with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>It was the act of a patriot, and he had no reason to be ashamed of it. He could not prevent the disruption of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>He had tried every means to avert the catastrophe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>He had failed, and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had succeeded.
