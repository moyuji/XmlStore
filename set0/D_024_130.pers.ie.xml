<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName> expressed himself satisfied, but subsequently <hi rend="italics">ventured</hi> to draw Mr. A.'s mention again to the subject, upon a statement made to Government that within a fortnight <num value="1278">1,278</num> emigrants had sailed from <placeName reg="Cobh, Cork, Munster" key="tgn,1042730">Queenstown</placeName> for New York, many of them young men &mdash; that <num value="800">800</num> word booked for the next departure for the same place &mdash; that additional steamers had to be put on the line engaged in the business of conveying emigrants &mdash; and that the prospect of large bounties had been held out to young men throughout the country, the emigrants themselves admitting that they got <measure n="250dollars" type="currency">$250</measure> and <measure n="300dollars" type="currency">$300</measure> bounty: their friends is New York also receiving large commissions for inducing them to emigrate. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>But their overtures had been rejected, no authority from his Government being given &#x0022;to listen to any proposals of the kind&#x0022; Instructions to the same effect, he says, were given to all the <name>Consuls</name> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>He then lets out the manner in which the thing is done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>He has been informed by a gentleman of influence that the great corporations for the extension of railways in the western part of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> having lost many of the laborers on their lines, by drafting for the army, were endeavoring to fill their places with aliens exempt from military service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>With the adroitness for which his people are so remarkable he makes use of his very correspondence to advertise for emigrants by stating to <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName> that &#x0022;there is no doubt of the fact that there is a great scarcity of laborers in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>,&#x0022; and he adds: &#x0022;I learn from private sources that the rate of wages this season is very much advanced!&#x0022; These things he coolly informs <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName> &#x0022;may explain the phenomenon of emigration to which your lordship has been pleased to draw my attention&#x0022; Very satisfactory, no doubt, to his lordship! </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> Foreigners do not seem entirely satisfied with their treatment at the <rs>North</rs>, and enlistments among them do not thrive so well as in the beginning of the war. <persName n="Meagher,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Meagher,nomatch:0"><surname>Meagher</surname></persName>, being unable to recruit his regiment, which had been nearly all slaughtered, resigned his office with evident dissatisfaction at the manner he and his men had been treated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>But the best indication of the growing reluctance of foreigners to enter the <rs>Federal</rs> army is afforded by the proclamation which <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> has recently published, giving <measure n="65days" type="date">sixty-five days</measure> notice to all foreigners who have recorded their intention to become citizens of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> that after that period they will be liable to military duty, and no plea of alienage will exempt them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> &#x0022;No recognition or mediation would have the smallest weight, unless it were backed up by more forcible arguments, and these arguments we are not disposed to apply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>We have nothing to do but to wait, and hope that these <num value="2">two</num> unhappy maniac may soon come to themselves and see what they are about.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> Sentiments more thoroughly heartless than those just quoted have never emanated from any journal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The <num value="2">two</num> combatants are represented as &#x0022;unhappy maniacs&#x0022; in the very teeth of the often repeated declaration of the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> that the cause of the <rs>South</rs> is the cause of constitutional liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Does the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> consider it &#x0022;maniacal&#x0022; to defend such a cause with all the energy and courage that a nation can summon to the rescue?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>If <name>English</name> liberty were assailed at its own altars as that of the <rs>South</rs> is, would not every <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishman</rs> rush to arms, and in that event would the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> denounce the whole nation as an &#x0022;unhappy maniac?&#x0022; Would it put the defenders of all that is dear to man on the same level with those who would plunder and despoil him of his dearest rights?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Or are life, liberty, and property, less precious in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> than <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> The <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> then proceeds to intimate that the interest of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> is the supreme rule by which her conduct is governed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>This is what we had always supposed, though we had not expected such an unblushing avowal of it from the leading organ of <name>English</name> public opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>And is interest the only principle which governs the foreign policy of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>So we must conclude from the declaration of the <hi rend="italics">Times.</hi> We had supposed that, whilst nations ought to take care of their own households, there was such a thing as the common interest of humanity, which sometimes had a claim to their consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>When war degenerates into murder, robbery, and arson; into the banishment of whole populations from their home, and the deliberate organization of servile insurrection, there is or ought to be some rule higher than dollars and cents to govern the action of the civilized spectators of such scenes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>But even on the calculation of selfish interest, <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> has sorely mistaken her true policy, as she will <num value="1">one</num> day see, in declining to unite with the wise and generous French Emperor in intervening to put an end to this quarrel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> would never have dared to resist the combined arms of the <num value="2">two</num>, as is evident from the manner in which she </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/> These are the facts; now let us cursorily consider them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>It is evident that the enemy designs the reduction of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, and expects to accomplish it by taking <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00043" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,John,,,:1"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, and thus cutting off our chief means of supplies and reinforcements.

Moreover, he is in the midst of a hostile country, and has left partly in his rear the forces now forming the line from Big Black to <placeName reg="Warrenton, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2114921">Warrenton</placeName>, which can be strengthened from <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, and may intercept his supplies and reinforcements and cut off his retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>It, then, our line of interception can be maintained, it is patent that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00044" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> cannot make a protracted siege, but finding himself surrounded, must soon either advance to a conflict of arms or be forced by starvation to surrender. </p>
