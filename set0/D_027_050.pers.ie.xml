<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The situation in front of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> is unchanged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Some skirmishing and a good deal of picket firing continue on our right, the lines being very near to each other, and the temptation to take an occasional shot at the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> irresistible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>On Wednesday there was some cannonading all day on the left and centre, and in the afternoon the city was briskly shelled by the enemy's batteries near the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>This was the <orgName type="regiment" key="1Regular">first regular</orgName> shelling of any consequence for several weeks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The only damage to property was the partial burning of <num value="1">one</num> small tenement, and the only casualty the killing of a negro in the lower part of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The cannonading on the left was kept up, with occasional intermissions, until a late hour of the night. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> As we stated yesterday, on the authority of reports brought in by scouts, but a comparatively small length of the track of the <orgName n="Weldon Railroad" type="railroad">Weldon railroad</orgName> has been torn up. It is believed that the road has not been destroyed as far as <orgName n="Reams Station" type="station">Reams's station</orgName>, and that the rails, instead of being heated and twisted, so as to render them unfit for further use are being hauled away as fast as they are taken up. The impression also prevails to some extent that the enemy intends to preserve the road intact for his own use, <hi rend="italics">in case</hi> of the evacuation of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> &mdash; an event so far in the future that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> may as well secure a life lease on his position between <orgName n="Reams Station" type="station">Reams's station</orgName> and <placeName><persName n="Davis,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Davis,nomatch:0"><surname>Davis</surname></persName>'s farm</placeName>, and will it to his heirs and assigns. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The enemy's position on the railroad has not been materially altered, and as he is closely watched by the experienced eyes of skillful generals, and confronted at every point by our troops, he can move no farther without endangering his safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>If any farther movement is intended, it will occur in the shape of raids, which have been already foreshadowed by hints in the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> newspapers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>We are not aware of the future plans of our commanding officers, but feel assured that they will be dictated by good judgment and carried out with success. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> Prisoners report that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, <persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><surname>Meade</surname></persName>, and all the prominent <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> generals, are with the army south of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, busily inspecting and noting the advantages of the new position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Prisoners and deserters are brought in daily. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> Nothing of importance occurred on the lines south of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> yesterday; but the indications are that we shall have stirring news from that quarter before many days elapse. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> We have received some gratifying particulars of the recent engagement near <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The rout of the enemy was complete, equalling, if it did not surpass, the stampede from <placeName key="tgn,7017708" n="1.000 36" reg="winchester, winchester, virginia">Kernstown</placeName> a few weeks since.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The enemy had in the fight about <num value="8000">eight thousand</num> cavalry, and some <num value="4000">four thousand</num> or <num value="5000">five thousand</num> infantry, which was the <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName> of their main army, the latter being in full retreat towards the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>After the affair at <placeName reg="Front Royal, Warren, Virginia" key="tgn,2111870">Front Royal</placeName>, our army pushed on, and coming up with the <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName> at <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>, were, for a short time, held at bay by their artillery, and suffered some little loss, but nothing could withstand the valor of our troops, and with a yell they charged the enemy, who broke and ran in the wildest confusion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> They were pursued for several miles beyond <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>, when darkness compelled <persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Early,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName> to call off his men and allow them to rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The next morning the pursuit was recommenced, but the enemy had taken advantage of the darkness and gotten too far in advance to be overtaken. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> We got about <measure n="250" type="prisoners">two hundred and fifty prisoners</measure> and <num value="1">one</num> piece of artillery, besides a number of horses, and any quantity of small arms, clothing, &#x0026;c., which the enemy in their fright threw away. </p>

<head>The Order.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>The order is a secret <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>It is called by different names in different localities or States, and is known among its members by these initials, written thus: O. A. K. Its real object is to embarrass and thwart the administration of the <rs>General Government</rs> in the conduct of the war, and overthrow the <rs>Government</rs>, if that be necessary, to secure the supremacy of the <name>Order</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Its professions, as well as its purposes, are different in different States; thus, while it professes and proclaims a war policy in New York, <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> and other States, in <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName> and other Western States it is for peace; so while in the eastern section of the <rs>Union</rs> it is clamorous for the restoration of the &#x0022;Constitution as it is and the <rs>Union</rs> as it was, &#x0022; in the western its undisguised object and avowed policy is the establishment of a Northwestern Confederacy. </p> </div4>

<head>Its principle and oath.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/> The aim and fundamental principle, if principle it may be called, upon which the organization is founded, and which is incorporated in the oath or obligation of every degree taken by any member thereof, is that the chosen officers of our Government have usurped authority; and they claim it, not only as their right, but as their duty, to resist those officers, and, if needs be, to expel them by force; in plain, unvarnished <persName n="English,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00041" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>, that <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00042" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> is a usurper, and that it is not only their right, but their duty, to drive him out of the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>It is claimed by them, and so explained in the oath or obligation itself which they take, that such resistance to the existing functionaries of the <rs>Government</rs> is not revolution, but only the assertion of right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>To make this point more clear, the following extract from the oath is given: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/> &#x0022;In accordance with the principles upon which is founded the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> theory, Government can exercise only delegated powers; hence if those who shall have been chosen to administer the <rs>Government</rs> shall assume to exercise powers not delegated, they should be regarded and treated as <hi rend="italics">usurpers.</hi>&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/> The meaning of this, to leave no doubt, is explained in the same obligation still further by these words: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/> &#x0022;The reference to inherent power, as also to existing necessity, on the part of the functionary for the sanction of any arbitrary exercise of power by him, we will not accept in palliation or excuse.&#x0022; </p> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/> The origin of the order is traced to the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, and it has been erected upon the ruins of &#x0022;the <name>Knights</name> of the <rs>Golden Circle</rs>,&#x0022; which, at <num value="1">one</num> time, was extensive among officers of the rebel army and their sympathizing secession friends in the loyal States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>He said that the terms of peace which they would offer to the <rs>President</rs> would be honorable to the <rs>Confederacy</rs>; that they did not desire that the <rs>Confederacy</rs> should accept any other terms, but would be glad to have my promise, as they gave theirs, that their visit should be kept a profound secret if it failed to result in peace; that it would not be just that either party should seek any advantage by divulging the fact of their overture for peace, if unsuccessful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>He has at last reached a position from which he may give us some trouble by operating on the <rs>Danville</rs> railroads through parties of raiders, if our leaders should relax their vigilance, which we are well assured that they will not do, and if that road itself be not in a defensible condition, which, we are assured, it is. Apart from the danger to be apprehended to the railroad in question, we do not see that he has approached any nearer his object than he was before the battle of <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>He is actually farther off from <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, and the chances of isolating it are no greater now than they were then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>By extending his line, he weakens it, of course, and renders it more liable to be attacked at a disadvantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>Though he could permanently cut us off from all communication with the <rs>South</rs>, he could not affect our supplies in any great degree; and that he cannot do, even though he should take and permanently hold the <orgName n="Danville Railroad" type="railroad">Danville railroad</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>Of itself, the <orgName n="Weldon Railroad" type="railroad">Weldon railroad</orgName> has, for some time past, been of little or no practical value to us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/> From a very remarkable article in the <hi rend="italics">Enquirer</hi> of yesterday, we learn general truths which ought to set at rest every apprehension which the public may entertain with regard to the consequences likely to result from the occupation of the <orgName n="Weldon Railroad" type="railroad">Weldon railroad</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>Our <hi rend="italics">true</hi> communication with the <rs>South</rs> the writer of that article says, and says truly, is beyond the reach of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00191" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, his army, and his gang of thieves that go by the name of raiders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>If the <orgName n="Danville Railroad" type="railroad">Danville railroad</orgName> be cut, the communication of the <rs>South</rs> with <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName> still remains intact, and it may be extended to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> by the canal and the <orgName n="Central Railroad" type="railroad">Central railroad</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>But we are not so dependent on the <rs>South</rs> for provisions as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> imagine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>The harvests of the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James</placeName> and the <placeName reg="Rivanna, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1129131">Rivanna rivers</placeName>, and of the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>, have been abundant, and are all gathered in. Though the communication with the <rs>South</rs> were entirely destroyed, there is still an abundant supply for the subsistence of our armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> idea of starving us out, and forcing us to abandon our positions by tearing up railroad tracks and cutting the bridges, is not only preposterous of itself, but has been to them the source of enormous loss in men, horses, artillery, and the materials generally of war. In the meantime, the railroads thus torn up are repaired before any serious inconvenience can arise from the want of their services, and long before the army would be in a starving condition, were it even solely dependent on them for supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>This was demonstrated beyond the possibility of a mistake during the current summer, after the raids of <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00192" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,nomatch:0"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> and <persName n="Hunter,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00193" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><surname>Hunter</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>The repairs on the <placeName reg="Danville, Danville, Virginia" key="tgn,7014729">Danville</placeName> road were completed in <measure n="19days" type="date">nineteen days</measure>, and those on the <rs>Central</rs> within the same space of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>In the raid of <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, <num value="23">twenty-three</num> bridges &mdash; among them the bridge over <placeName reg="New River, West Virginia, West Virginia" key="tgn,1125392">New river</placeName>, <measure n="1800feet" type="distance">eighteen hundred feet</measure> long and <measure n="60feet" type="distance">sixty feet</measure> high &mdash; was burned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>Although the timber with which this bridge was repaired was, at the time of its destruction, growing in the woods, the materials were provided and the work executed in <measure n="19days" type="date">nineteen days</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>They destroyed every bridge from <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName> to <placeName reg="Salem, Essex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014447">Salem</placeName>, a distance of <measure n="60miles" type="distance">sixty miles</measure>, and rendered it necessary to replace from <num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num> to <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> cross-ties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>The rails had been heated, bent and twisted, and were straitened and replaced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>The timber for these bridges and cross-ties, as well as for wood-sheds, and water-tanks, and other necessary structures, was growing in the woods when the raid occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>The enemy had destroyed <num value="4000">four thousand</num> lineal feet of bridging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/><num value="1">One</num> of these bridges was nearly <measure n="800feet" type="distance">eight hundred feet</measure> long and <measure n="60feet" type="distance">sixty feet</measure> high.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>The whole of these repairs, except the principal bridge, was finished in <measure n="19days" type="date">nineteen days</measure>, and the road was in running order from <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName> to <placeName reg="Bristol, Bristol, Virginia" key="tgn,2110785">Bristol</placeName> within less than <measure n="60days" type="date">sixty days</measure> from the day of its destruction.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/> We make this quotation, not only to show what energy and enterprise can do, but to prove that our communication with the <rs>South</rs>, by means of the <orgName n="Danville Railroad" type="railroad">Danville railroad</orgName>, cannot be destroyed as long as raiding parties are the only dependence for destroying it. Permanent occupation is the only thing that can effect it, and we hardly think that possible just at this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>Even should the <rs type="place">High bridge</rs> on the <orgName n="Southside Railroad" type="railroad">Southside railroad</orgName> be destroyed, a temporary road could be made around the track, or the <orgName n="Danville Railroad" type="railroad">Danville railroad</orgName> could be reached from the <rs>Southside</rs> by a road from <placeName key="tgn,7014170" n="1.000 62" reg="farmville, prince edward, virginia">Farmville</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,2112496" n="1.000 4" reg="keysville, charlotte, virginia">Keysville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>Much anxiety has been felt with regard to the existence of <rs n="railroad iron" type="product">railroad iron</rs> in sufficient quantities to repair these roads as they are broken up; but it need no longer be felt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>Steps have already been taken at <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName> for re-rolling old <rs n="railroad iron" type="product">railroad iron</rs>, and no doubt similar arrangements will be made here and elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>In a short time, <rs n="railroad iron" type="product">railroad iron</rs> may be made abundant, at least for all the purposes of war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/> For most of the facts here stated we are indebted to the article in the <hi rend="italics">Enquirer,</hi> supposed to have been written by an eminent citizen of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, long distinguished by his thorough knowledge of the resources of the <rs>State</rs> and his zeal in the cause of internal improvement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>We hail the opinion that our railroads cannot be long kept out of use by means of raids, as the more important, because we believe it is supported, if it was not originally inspired, by men of the largest experience and the highest practical ability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>That is the only element in the question of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00195" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s present position which need give us the slightest uneasiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>If he cannot disable the <orgName n="Danville Railroad" type="railroad">Danville railroad</orgName> so as effectually to cut us off from the <rs>South</rs>--if he cannot cut us off from the <rs>South</rs> even by disabling the <orgName n="Danville Railroad" type="railroad">Danville railroad</orgName> effectually &mdash; and if he cannot starve out our army, even though he should cut off our communication with the <rs>South</rs>,--then we have nothing serious to apprehend from his late movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>It takes him out of the low grounds of the <rs>Appomattox</rs> and places him in a healthier position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>That is something, but it is all. It does not give him <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, nor does it advance him in his progress towards its capture. </p> </div3>
