<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The former is a little more bold, while the latter is still firm and determined in pushing on the draft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>What the <rs>Governor</rs> will do now remains to be seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The papers speak of &#x0022;great excitement,&#x0022; and a &#x0022;State Rights&#x0022; party is announced as having been formed in <placeName reg="New York, Kings, New York" key="tgn,7007567">Gotham</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>If both sides stand fast a collision must take place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>But there will more than likely be some backing out. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> The news from <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName> is a little interesting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Trouble is brewing there it appears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Secession has begun to show itself a little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Well, without anticipating any particular movement among the people of the <rs>Federal States</rs>, or counting upon any great disturbance there in an especially short time, it is certain that there are enough of the elements of discord to produce at any moment a very great convulsion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Nothing can prevent it but the strong arm of military power, and even that may be insufficient.

<head>Bombshells and aristocracy.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> We see it stated that <persName n="Porter,Admiral,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Porter,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Admiral">Admiral</roleName> <surname>Porter</surname></persName>, during the bombardment of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, availed himself of the agency of bombshells to transmit a large number of handbills inside, addressed to the private soldiers of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, endeavoring to excite their prejudices against their officers as aristocrat, who would get all the glory while they did all the fighting, and who would never permit their names to be given to the world, no matter how great their valor and self sacrifice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> We had supposed that <persName n="Porter,Admiral,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Porter,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Admiral">Admiral</roleName> <surname>Porter</surname></persName> was an honest fighting sailor, and not a dirty demagogue; but it seems we were mistaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>We should like to know if he ever heard of an army or a navy in which it was possible to publish all the names of the rank and file, and if so, why he, the aforesaid <hi rend="italics"><rs type="role2">Admiral</rs>,</hi> has never published the names of the sailors under his command, or <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> those of the rank and file of his army?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>He must think the soldiers of the <rs>South</rs> are dolts and idiots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>He don't know the men he is fighting against.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>They are not mercenaries and agrarians, but patriots, and many of them persons of education and wealth, who had a higher motive for taking up arms than to get their names in the news papers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>They took up arms to deliver their country, not for glory and emolument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>As to aristocracy, we have yet to see the country where an aristocracy does not exist, and the only question is what it shall consist of &mdash; men endowed by the <name>Creator</name> with qualities which fit them to become leaders of society, or whether they shall be a vulgar pinchbeck imitation of good society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Nowhere is there a more tyrannical and heartless aristocracy than that of the <rs>North</rs>, and, as to their officers, the men have often complained of the contrast which their brutal tyranny presents to the gentlemanlike conduct of Southern officers to soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>No great merit is due Southern officers for this, for many of the privates are gentlemen by birth and station as much as their officers, and all are hold in as high esteem by their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>All are engaged in the same holy cause, and if either class as a class have won superior honors, it is the privates, because they have no conceivable motive but patriotism to govern their conduct. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> The reproach of aristocracy is an old <num value="1">one</num> against the <rs>South</rs>; but it comes with a poor grace from the stiff and starched upstarts of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The gentlemen and ladies of the <rs>South</rs>, like true gentlemen and ladies everywhere, are kind and unpretending in their manner to all, and not afraid of compromising their dignity by courteous treatment of all classes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The Northern aristocrat, on the other hand, can be told a mile off by his stiff and icy demeanor, and his ridiculous attempts to be lofty and exclusive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Such people cannot generally go back many generations without stumbling over some of those mechanical callings which he professes to hold in such supreme contempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>From such aristocrats may the <rs>South</rs> long be delivered!
