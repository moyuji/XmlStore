<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>Everybody will at once see how this may be brought about.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>A certain <rs type="role2">Senator</rs> has a grudge against the head of some department &mdash; say of War for example.

Forthwith the logs are set to rolling, and the result is that the <rs>President</rs>, when he sends in his nominations, soon finds that he is without a Cabinet, and has to nominate a new set. By this time the victorious cabal is determined that no nominations shall succeed but such as are acceptable to themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>At last the <rs>President</rs> yields, and the <name>Senate</name> dictates the names he shall send in.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>The intention of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, which is that the <rs>President</rs> shall be the <rs>Executive</rs>, and which says so in so many words, is entirely defeated.

Why not pass a law to renominate annually all Ambassadors, Charges, Consuls, Judges, and all other officers of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>Why not take the whole Executive power at once? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/> We said Monday that the passage of this law would imply a violation of the <rs>Constitution</rs> in its spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>The words of the <rs>Constitution</rs> are, &#x0022;The principal officers in each of the <rs>Executive Departments</rs>, and all persons connected with the diplomatic service, may be removed from office <hi rend="italics">at the pleasure of the <rs>President</rs>.</hi>&#x0022; Now, by the proposed law, another method of removing them is established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>The pleasure of the <rs>President</rs> is no longer the limitation of the tenure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>A <hi rend="italics">new</hi> limitation is prescribed &mdash; a limitation of <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>. Is <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> the &#x0022;pleasure of the <rs>President</rs>?&#x0022; Is that the meaning of the phrase?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>If it is not, then most assuredly there is a discrepancy between the limitation and the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>Take the limitation of <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> for law, and the limitation of the <rs>Constitution</rs> cannot exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>The <num value="2">two</num> cannot live together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>The <num value="1">one</num> entirely abrogates the other; and who gave Congress any power to abrogate the <rs>Constitution</rs>, or any part of it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>We leave it to the plain common sense of any man to say if this be not so. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/> We are told that the <rs>Constitution</rs> leaves the matter open to legislation &mdash; that it says these officers shall hold at the pleasure of the <rs>President</rs>, but does not say that Congress shall not impose another limitation.--We deny this in <hi rend="italics">toto</hi> When the <rs>Constitution</rs> says that they may be removed at the pleasure of the <rs>President</rs> it leaves open no other means of removing them except that which itself prescribes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>If any other mode be adopted &mdash; no matter what it may be &mdash; the officer is no longer removable at the pleasure of the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>Another mode may be adopted, but it must be by amending the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/><foreign lang="lat"> &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">Durants bene placito</hi>&#x0022; </foreign>--the original phraseology of which, &#x0022;at pleasure,&#x0022; is the translation, implied the highest exercise of a <persName n="King,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00350" reg="nearbymention:King,James,,,"><surname>King</surname></persName>'s prerogative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>The officer who held by that tenure was always understood to be appointed for life, unless the <rs>King</rs> should think proper to change his intention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>And so in this case the <rs>Constitution</rs> evidently meant to this tenure of office during the <rs>President</rs>'s pleasure, co-existent with the <rs>President</rs>'s official life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>To alter the tenure is to do violence to the fundamental law. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/> This bill, in a word, erects the <name>Senate</name> into an oligarchy, at the expense of the powers of the <num value="2">two</num> co-ordinate branches of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, of the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>It assumes for the <name>Senate</name> the power of removing Cabinet officers alter they themselves have confirmed them; for, if they can remove every <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>, why not every year, or every <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>, or every month?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>At present, the <rs>President</rs> cannot remove any civil officer (except Cabinet and diplomatic officers) without giving a reason for doing so. The Senate seem to be usurping the power to do so, without giving any reason at all. Diplomatic officers are excepted, because the reasons may be confidential.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/><rs type="role" reg="Cabinet-Officer">Cabinet officers</rs>, because from the intimate relations which are supposed to exist, and ought to exist, between themselves and the <rs>President</rs>, the <rs>Constitution</rs> has left the matter entirely with the latter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/> The popular body is the <rs type="place">House</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>They come directly from the people, and become again a portion of the people every <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>. They, therefore, are supposed to have the freshest intelligence with regard to the sentiments of the people, and more truly to reflect their sentiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>If a vote of want of confidence be proposed, it follows of course that it should come from that body which is most emphatically the popular <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>It may happen that the people (in whose name the vote of want of confidence is cast) sympathize with the <rs>President</rs> and not with the <name>Senate</name>, and that the sympathies of the <rs type="place">House</rs> are also with him. This happened frequently in the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">U. S. Government</orgName>--we have no doubt it would occur to-morrow on any question upon which the <name>Senate</name> and the <rs>President</rs> might be at issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>Notwithstanding, this bill gives to the <name>Senate</name> &mdash; the aristocratic body of the <rs>Constitution</rs> &mdash; control over both <rs type="role2">President</rs> and <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>If anything add to the palpable absurdity of such a scheme, it would be the fact that the <name>Senate</name>, from the small number of its members, is, like all small bodies, peculiarly liable to personal influences, and, therefore, peculiarly unfitted to deal with such questions as this bill gives them the control of; especially with originating votes of want of confidence, where they are almost sure to come in conflict with the popular will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>The revolution which this bill proposes seems to have, in a word, no other object than to confer power upon the <name>Senate</name> &mdash; to make it the most detestable of all oligarchies, an elective oligarchy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/> In <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> the <rs>Cabinet</rs> all have seats upon the floor.
