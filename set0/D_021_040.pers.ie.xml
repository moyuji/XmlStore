<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> The military education of <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> officers has been a source of great benefit to the volunteer as well as the regular service.--The severe discipline and study which is undergone at <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> by the young cadet, fits him, if he graduates, to hold not only an honorable position in the army proper, but in any position to which he may be called as a civilian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Having, of course, undergone a rigid discipline, he is ready, when he joins his company, to enforce the same discipline upon others under him; and the stringent rules by which the regular troops are governed, form a thorough basis for the establishment of a well-governed and disciplined corps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>The volunteer service, however, is far different, it being composed of men whose occupation has previously been that of a civilian, and who know nothing of military tactics and discipline, having yet to learn it. The officers, too, are (many of them) selected more for some political or home influence than for their military knowledge, and, consequently, a strict discipline, so necessary to any army, cannot be preserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>There are, however, some exceptions among officers who have been appointed from the ranks for meritorious services; and these alone, who have been through the routine of camp and field life, may command respect and enforce discipline in a volunteer organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>With this great volunteer force in the field, our officers can only advance its interests by knowledge obtained by observation and practice, for we had not the means at the time to perfect the volunteer organization. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>As the taxes which come into the <name>Treasury</name> are raised by an equitable assessment upon all there is an obvious propriety that the <rs>State</rs> should contribute to this necessary expense. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>The Federal Government recognizes such advances as just claims upon proper vouchers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>It must be apparent, however, that it every expenditure of the kind, before being made, is to await the action of the <name>Treasury</name> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, the public service may be greatly, perhaps vitally, injured by the delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>Owing to the disloyalty of the sheriffs in other counties, nothing was received from them prior to that date.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>But the <rs>State Government</rs> has since been reorganized in a large number of these counties, and loyal sheriffs are now actively employed in collecting the taxes therein for the present year, which will largely augment the receipts of the revenue. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/> I respectfully call your attention to the suggestions made by the <rs>Auditor</rs> in his report in regard to the appropriations of your extra session. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/> There are persons among us who support and encourage the cause of the rebellion by every means in their power, short of overt acts of treason.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/> Another portion of our citizens are engaged in a most active and decided support of the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>I would recommend that if any person hereafter guilty of such offence has any property or debts within the territory where the authority of this Government is acknowledged, such property and debts should he confiscated to the <rs>State</rs>, subject to the just debts of the offender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>And I would also recommend that it any person has abandoned his home within our territory to go within the <rs>Confederate</rs> lines, the <rs>Executive</rs> should be authorized to issued proclamation requiring him to return, and if he fails to do so within the time specified in the proclamation that fact should <unclear></unclear> be deemed <hi rend="italics">prima facie</hi> evidence that he has been guilty of offences subjecting his property to confiscation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/> I recommend the repeal of the stay saw passed at your extra session.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>The necessity for it no longer exists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>Persons have taken advantage of the law, though they have the means of paying their debts; and the suspension of the power to collect debts seems to have encouraged the disorders of the times, by creating an impression that all law was suspended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>The property, however, of soldiers, while in the service of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, should be protected from execution or attachment; and persons engaged in supporting rebellion, or who, being inhabitants of the <rs>State</rs>, shall refuse to take an oath of fidelity to the same, should be denied the right to sue in our courts. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>Satisfied that they are prudently managed, for the interests both of the public and their own stockholders, to additional legislation is, I think, necessary at this period respecting them. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>In addition to this, there are scores of Quartermasters and Assistant Quartermasters, Commissaries and Assistant Commissaries, Surgeons and <rs type="role" reg="Assistant-Surgeon">Assistant Surgeons</rs>, ranking as <rs type="role2">Colonels</rs>, <rs type="role2">Majors</rs> and <rs type="role2">Captains</rs>, and receiving the pay attached to those respective ranks. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/> What propriety is there in paying Quartermasters and Commissaries by the rank they may hold, instead of the duties they may perform?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>Why pay a Quartermaster with the rank of <rs type="role2">Major</rs> more than <num value="1">one</num> with the rank of <rs type="role2">Captain</rs>, when they perform equal duties?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>I have no hesitation in saying that <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">$100</measure> per month is large compensation for any Quartermaster, <rs type="role" n="Commissary">Commissary</rs>, or <rs type="role2">Surgeon</rs> in the army, except the <rs type="role" reg="General-Officer">general officers</rs> of these departments at the seat of Government; and that the pay of all the officers of the army ought to be reduced at least <num value="0.2">20 per cent.</num> --There is no branch of the service more needing reform and retrenchment than this rather ornamental branch of Quartermasters and Commissaries on the country, and the sooner it is done the better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>The <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName> has had this subject of the reduction of officers' pay under consideration, and has proposed a reduction of about <num value="0.2">20 per cent</num>; and while I have no sympathy with or respect for that Government, yet it is prudent to profit even by the example of our enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>This reduction would enable the <rs>Government</rs> maternally to increase the pay of the privates, without at all increasing the expenses of the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/> Why is it that this unjust discrimination between the pay of the officers and privates should be made?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>Is the private soldier of volunteer less patriotic than his captain?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>Are his affections less ardent and true for the home and the loved ones he has left behind him. Who is it that, at the peril of his life, stands as a picket nearest the lines of the enemy, to give warning of this approach?
