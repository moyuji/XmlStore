<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>how can I tell you of the tortures that have nearly erased me for the last <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>! Pen is powerless to trace, words weak to convey <num value="1">one</num> tittle of the misery I have endured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>I thought myself strong before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>I have seen so much of suffering that I thought my nerves had grown steady, and I could bear anything; but today <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> I am weak and trembling like a frightened child. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/> &#x0022;But do not wonder at it. My dear husband lien beside me, wounded unto death, perhaps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>I have lost all hope of saving him, though I thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name> for the privilege of being this moment beside him.--And besides this, all around me the sufferers lie moaning in agony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>There has been little time to tend them &mdash; poor fellows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>True, the surgeons are busy all the time, but all the wounded have not yet been brought in, and it seems as if the time will never come when our brave men shall have been made as comfortable as circumstances may permit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>It is awful to look around me. I can see every imaginable form of suffering, and yet am helpless to aid them any of consequence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/> &#x0022;Since night before last I have not left my husband's side for a moment, except to get such things as I required, or to hand some poor fellow a cup of water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>Even as I write my heart throbs achingly to hear the deep groans and sharp cries about me, F. is sleeping, but I dare not close my eyes, lest he should die while I sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>And it is to keep awake, and in a manner relieve my overburdened heart, that I am writing to you now under such sad auspices. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/> &#x0022;On the morning of the <num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num> inst the fight begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>The attack was made on <orgName n="division"><persName n="McArthur,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00059" reg="mostcommon:McArthur,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McArthur</surname></persName>'s division</orgName>, and we could plainly hear the roll of the artillery here, as it is about <measure n="2.5miles" type="distance">two miles and a half</measure> distance only from this place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>Oh, the fearful agony of that awful, awful day!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>I had seen F. a moment early in the morning, but it was only a moment, when he bade me good-bye, saying hurriedly, as he tore himself away: &#x0027;Pray for me, my wife, and if I fall, <name n="God" type="God">God</name> protect you!&#x0027; There was something in his look and tone which struck a chill to my heart, and every moment after I know the fight had begun I felt as if he had indeed fallen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>I cannot tell how long it was before I heard that <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Oglesby,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00060" reg="mostcommon:Oglesby,nomatch:0"><surname>Oglesby</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> was engaged, but it seemed an age to me. After that my agony was nearly intolerable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>I never had a thought of fear for myself; I was thinking only of F. Then I got the word that he had been hotly pursued by the rebels and had fallen back. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/> &#x0022;Later in the afternoon I succeeded in gaining a little intelligible information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>Poor <persName n="Hackleman,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00061" reg="mostcommon:Hackleman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Hackleman</surname></persName> was shot through the neck while giving a command, and fell mortally wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>He died between <time value="10">10</time> and <time value="11oclock">11 o'clock</time> the same night, I have since learned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>Up to the time of receiving the wound he had acted with the greatest bravery and enthusiasm, tempered by a coolness that made every action effective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>When dusk at last put an end to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day's conflict, I learned that <persName n="Oglesby,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00062" reg="mostcommon:Oglesby,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Oglesby</surname></persName> had been dangerously wounded, but could gain no intelligence of my husband.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>I could not bear the suspense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>Dark as it was, and helpless as it seemed to search for him then, I started out to the battle-field. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/> &#x0022;O. how shall I describe the search of that night?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>It looked like madness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>It was madness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>But all night long I struggled amongst bleeding corpses, over dead horses, trampled limbs, shattered artillery &mdash; everything that goes to make up the horror of a battle field when the conflict is over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>They were removing the wounded all night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>Oh, think how awful to stumble over the dead and hear the cries of the wounded and dying, alone, and in the night time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>I had to start off alone, else they would not have let me go. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/> &#x0022;As you may suppose, I could not find him, either among the living or dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>But the next morning, just after sunrise, I came to a little clump of timbers where a horse had fallen &mdash; his head shot off, and his body half covering a man whom I supposed dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>His face was to the ground, but as I stooped to look closer, I perceived a faint movement of the body, then heard a faint moan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>I stooped and turned the face upward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>The head and face were both covered with blood, but when I turned it to the light I knew it in spite of its disfiguration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>Oh, <name n="God" type="God">God</name>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>the agony of that moment sickened me almost to suffocation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>With a strength I thought impossible in me, I drew him, crushed and bleeding, from beneath the carcase of our poor old horse, whom we had both so loved and petted, and, dipping my handkerchief in a little pool of water amongst the bushes, bathed his face and pressed some moisture between his parched, swollen lips.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>He was utterly insensible, and there was a dreadful wound in his head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>Both limbs were crushed hopelessly beneath the horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>He was utterly beyond the reach of human skill to save, but as soon as possible I had him conveyed to the hospital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>I have nursed him ever since, hopelessly and with a heart breaking with grief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>Oh! how many wives, how many mothers, are to day mourning the dead and dying!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>He has not opened his eyes to look at or spoken to me since he fell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>Oh I could he but speak to me once before he dies, I should give him up with more resignation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>But to die thus &mdash; without a look or a word!
