<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Mothers yawned and sighed over their household cares, and children flattened their noses against the window panes in the rain endesvor to catch a glimpse of a bit of sunshine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>It was a day of most sombre aspect, and a man with the least bit of trouble on his mind would not have staked a continental brass button on the chances of life or death. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>When I was young--<num value="1">one</num> moment, gentle reader, that was not so very many years ago &mdash; stage coaches were in fashion, and railroads were beginning to march steadily towards my home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>There are many railroads now-a-days that make but little better time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Old people are accustomed to call those the palmy days of journeying, and seem to look back upon them with a sigh of regret that they exist no longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Stage coaches were very good in their day, they played their part in the history of civilization, they were the wonder and delight of boyhood; but now, I must confess, that to a poor sinner like my self, a good comfortable railroad car, with no dust, no fear of accidents, and <measure n="30miles" type="distance">thirty miles</measure> an hour, is quite good enough. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The lack of cistern water, or more properly rain water, has scarcely ever at this season been felt here since the plan of building cisterns was adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>He was so close as to discover that they had lanterns, with blinds on their sides, so as not be seen either in front or on the flanks. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/> Following the instructions of his General, he counted the bivouacs and sentinels, and ascertained that there were about <num value="500">500</num> men on the west side of the <rs type="place">Ferry</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>He then sought his horse, (which he was for some time unable to find, owing to the care with which he secreted him,) and then rode over to the other side of the <rs type="place">Ferry</rs>, where, by similar means he ascertained that the main body of the enemy, consisting of about <num value="3500">3,500</num> men, were on the east side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>After gaining every possible information, he returned to headquarters at day break, having been in the saddle, or on foot, all night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>These brave fellows left their mark upon the invaders, and many a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> fell before their unerring aim; but, owing to the complete arrangements and forethought of the enemy in providing litters, their killed and wounded were all rapidly removed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>During their retreat, <orgName n="cavalry"><persName n="Oswald,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00039" reg="mostcommon:Oswald,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Oswald</surname></persName>'s cavalry</orgName>, with double-barrel guns and revolvers, did good service. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>It is to us a sad and touching spectacle to see so many high-spirited and heroic gentlemen cast ashore, like the wrecks of stately vessels, and, instead of breasting the ocean wave, condemned to act only as passive breakwaters against the advancing tide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>Few landsmen can form an adequate conception of the pergatorial pangs which a seaman suffers when confined to the shore and prevented from exercising his talent and training upon his peculiar element.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>A fish out of water is the most <sic>expresisve</sic> type of his agonies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>No officers of the old army can by any possibility have made as great sacrifices in leaving the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> service as those of the navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>The former have given up a service in which, as a class, they would have been condemned for a long period to a subordinate position, and had no such opportunities of promotion and honor as their present posts in the <rs>Southern Army</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>We do not underrate their disinterestedness or their sacrifices, but we may ever, without injustice to them, that they are not to be compared with the sacrifices made by the <orgName n="Navy" type="military">Navy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>The officers of this branch left a Government in which they would always have had active employment upon their own element for <num value="1">one</num> which had no such attractions; and if their chances of promotion in the old service was not more than equal to those of the army, they had in the new no chance, even of the professional enterprise, by which promotion is obtained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>Nor can any <num value="1">one</num> but a sailor adequately appreciate the surrender of personal pride and comfort in being transferred from the spacious decks and frowning batteries of a magnificent ship-of-war, to some miserable littleing, with scarcely room enough in her to turn round in, or battery enough to sink a terrapin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>A <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs> compelled to descend from the back of a glorious war horse, and straddle a pony, with his heels dragging along the ground, is but a faint pacture of the condition of a naval officer in the <rs>Confederate</rs> service. --Just think of such a veteran of the deep as old <persName n="Tatnall,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00064" reg="mostcommon:Tatnall,nomatch:0"><surname>Tatnall</surname></persName>, whose fame is co-extensive with the world, and whose bread flag has floated over a squadron of as superb vessels of war as ever ploughed the deep, reduced to the command of a musquito fleet in a narrow bayon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>This is but <num value="1">one</num> specimen of the sacrifices made by our glorious naval officers, who have been content, for the aske of their country, to hamiliate themselves and serve her even in a barge, scow, tug or canal boat, rather than serve a despot in the most splendid pomp and circumstance of their profession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>We insist that such men deserve the public favor and the support of their Government, and that it cannot act with too great promptness and energy in giving them a field worthy of their fame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>Their services upon land have been thus far as cheerfully rendered as if they were afloat, and have proved of the greatest value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>The following communication to the <orgName n="Norfolk Day book" type="newspaper">Norfolk <hi rend="italics">Day Book</hi></orgName> from a naval officer thus vindicates the services rendered on land by the gentlemen of the navy: </p> <cit><q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>The only part borne by the navy in that vicinity, was by the little fleet of <persName n="Tatnall,flag-Officer,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00066" reg="mostcommon:Tatnall,nomatch:0"><roleName n="flag-Officer">flag officer</roleName> <surname>Tatnall</surname></persName>, who, with the slight force at his disposal, suceedded in annoying the enemy, and without loss accomplished all that could have been reasonably expected of him, and well sustained his previous daring reputation.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/> &#x0022;At every battery where naval officers have had command, and been employed to instruct the men in the exercise of the guns the enemy has been repulsed whenever an attack has been made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>Those who have been allowed to retain their commands, will endeavor to give a good account of themselves when the hour of trial comes, and frust their reputations to the work accomplished. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/> &#x0022;In addition to duty at batteries, naval officers have been efficiently employed in gun boats at New Orleans and the <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522"><rs type="direction">upper</rs> Mississippi</placeName>, on the coast of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> and <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>, on board the <rs type="ship">Sumter</rs> and <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>, at Navy Yards, at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, and at various points in the <rs>South</rs>, superintending the construction of gunboats. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/> &#x0022;While it is a source of deep regret to all naval officers that the <rs>Confederacy</rs> is without ships to meet the enemy on the ocean, they are certainly not to blams if the deficiency has not been supplied.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="from a naval officer"></bibl></cit>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>Its declaration of a paper blockade against our Southern seaboard, without any fleet at all worthy of the name, to enforce it; and its capture of vessels alleged to have violated it, was another source of irrilation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>The foreign world very soon, and as if by instinct, discovered that this was a war of gentlemen on <num value="1">one</num> side, with vulgar braggarts and bullies on the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>Now we would find ourselves in large chambers, with marble vaulted celling, of an inconceivable variety of fantastic convexities, and then almost on all-fours pursuing our on ward course through narrow passages beneath low arches; sometimes we would find ourselves on a pleasant, level, velvety bare floor; at other times on vast heaps, <num value="20">20</num> or <measure n="30feet" type="distance">30 feet</measure> deep, of the earth rich in saltpetre, awaiting release from its hiding place, and compounding with other ingredients to fulfill its mission of death to the enemies of our country, or to subserve and promote the interests of manufactures and commerce. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/> Above us and around us all the time were objects of wonder and admiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>Overhead, high and ragged, were the succession of arches, apparently of the same marble hardness and natural whiteness of the greater part of the sides of the chambers and passages, and the forming stalactites.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>All around us at intervals, near the walls, and on the chamber floors, were other stalactites forming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>In numerous cases those forming above and those below had met, needing but little aid from the imagination to invest them with the shapes of men and animals, and beautifully chiselled columns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>Here was <num value="1">one</num> with full bust and gracefully falling skirt, looking like a petrified giantess; then another, reminding <num value="1">one</num> of the sea-horse; yonder <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num>, called the elephant, and yet others, like little ebonies, (the smoke having discolored them,) and <num value="1">one</num> which tradition says is a monument to an <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> lost centuries ago in its subterranean labyrinths.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>We tried the experiment yesterday, and after drinking <num value="1">one</num> glass we arrived at the conclusion there was too much egg. We diluted the mixture with old Otard, and tried again, but after <num value="2">two</num> glasses of the new compound, we discovered it was not sufficiently sweet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>More sugar being added, we imbibed several glasses, but the result of the experiment was that the excess of sugar we had added <q> &#x0022;'gan to pall upon our wearied sense.&#x0022;</q> So we again diluted the mixture and set to; but this time it involved the opening of a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> bottle of brandy, which proved to be rather flery after sipping <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> glasses; so we qualified the mixture with rum. Now rum, <hi rend="italics">per se,</hi> is a very delectable beverage, and when mixed with brandy and converted into nog, it is fit for the gods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>So we devoted all our attention to the nog, and managed to put about a quart under our belt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/> We then smoked a cigar, and, feeling dry, imbibed <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> glasses of nog, but it had a villanous twang.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>We added more rum and then we drank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>We believe we drank several times more, when, not liking the flavor of the sugar, we thought we would go out and buy a plantation and make sugar to our own liking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>Took a turn around the room and took another drink.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>Somebody set <num value="2">two</num> glasses and <num value="2">two</num> bowls of nog on the table &mdash; at least it seemed so to us &mdash; so we waited for our friends to come; but, as they didnot, we drank to their health out of both bowls with <num value="2">two</num> tumblers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>Made more nog, cracked an egg containing a very juvenile chicken; popped him in, and rather reckon that chicken got tight at a very early age. Drank more nog. Feeling very dry, we concluded to go out and get a glass of nog; but, on looking up, we saw <num value="2">two</num> doors, and, as we knew our room had but <num value="1">one</num>, we thought we would wait till our friends, with whom we were drinking, should return and show us the way out.
