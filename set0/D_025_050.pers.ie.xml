<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Friend and opponent alike accord to him the fame of the most powerful declaimer of his day. He belonged to the <rs type="place">Southern Calhoun school</rs> of politicians, of which he was <num value="1">one</num> of the most faithful and consistent members.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>He entered professional life amidst the exciting scenes of the political epoch of '<num value="32">32</num>, when his distinguished father was <rs type="role" reg="Governor">Governor</rs> of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>In the field he was energetic, and shared the fate of the soldier &mdash; never shrinking from exposure to weather or battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>He was brave, generous, and loyal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>His granitic strength of character, while it fitted him for great labors, rendered him capable of sustaining manfully great reverses, and, in the language of a contemporary, &#x0022;communicated as fortitude and noble humor to every sentiment and recollection connected with him.&#x0022; </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>The night being dark they got into the water and swam off from the back of the island for the shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> The <num value="3">three</num> who landed near <rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs> City laid in a cornfield all night, and the next evening, about dark, started on their way South, after <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> having made known their condition to a farmer, who gave them a good supper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>From there they went to <placeName reg="Kent, Maryland, United States" key="tgn,1002539">Kent county, Md.</placeName>, where the citizens gave them new clothes and money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>After this their detection was less probable, as they had been wearing their uniforms the <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> previous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>They were not discovered, however, though to escape detection seemed almost impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>They got off the train at <persName n="Delamar,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Delamar,nomatch:0"><surname>Delamar</surname></persName> and went by way of Barren <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">Creek</rs> Springs and <placeName reg="Quantico, Wicomico, Maryland" key="tgn,2048392">Quantico, Md.</placeName>, to the <rs n="Nanticoke" type="nativeamerican">Nanticoke</rs> river, and got into a canal. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/> Here they parted company with <num value="5">five</num> others who had escaped from Fort <rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs> some days previous, as the canoe would not hold <num value="10">ten</num> of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>In the canoe they went to <placeName reg="Tangier's Sound">Tangier's Sound</placeName>, and, crossing the <rs>Chesapeake</rs>, landed in <placeName reg="Northumberland, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1002733">Northumberland county</placeName>, below <placeName reg="Point Lookout, Saint Marys, Maryland" key="tgn,1012121">Point Lookout</placeName>, a point at which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are building a fort for the confinement of prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>They met with great kindness from citizens of <placeName key="tgn,2112200" n="1.000 3" reg="heathsville, northumberland, virginia">Heathsville</placeName>, who contributed <measure n="120dollars" type="currency">$120</measure> to aid them on their route.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>They soon met with our pickets, and came to this city on the <orgName n="York River Railroad" type="railroad">York River Railroad</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>There was no difficulty experienced in either State in finding generous people of Southern sympathies, who would give them both money and clothing, and put themselves to any trouble to help them on their journey. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/> These gentlemen state that a large number of our prisoners at Fort <rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs> have taken the cath and enlisted in the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have already, from prisoners who have taken the oath, enlisted <num value="270">270</num> men in the <orgName type="regiment" key="3MDCav">3d Maryland cavalry</orgName>, <num value="160">160</num> men in a battalion of <orgName n="Heavy Artillery" type="artillery">heavy artillery</orgName>, and <num value="150">150</num> in an infantry regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>To effect these enlistments they circulate all sorts of lies among the prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>The chief lies are to the effect that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Lee,John,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> has resigned &mdash; that <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> has withdrawn from the <rs>Confederacy</rs> and sent commissioners from the <rs>State</rs> on to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> to make terms for re-entering the <rs>Union</rs>, and that <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> is only waiting for <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Lee,John,,,:1"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> to be driven from her borders, to resume her connection with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/> They tell the men if they will enlist they will be sent out West to fight the <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indians</rs>, and will never be sent South where there would be any danger of their capture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>When a prisoner agrees to enlist his name is put down in a book, and he is marched from the main body of the prisoners to another part of the island to join his companions in shame, who live in tents there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>He never comes back among his old comrades, for fear, as <num value="1">one</num> of our informants remarked, &#x0022;we should cut his d &mdash; d throat.&#x0022; They are jeered and hooted by their late companions as they pass out from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>Now, it does not produce the effect of a pebble thrown into a pond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>It does not start so much as a ripple in the public mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>We sometimes think so. But if it is willing to surrender its own freedom for the purpose of enslaving others, has it no choice of tyrants?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>When the <rs n="Jewish" type="religion">Jews</rs> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> insisted upon having a king, and when the prophet, having in vain depicted all <unclear></unclear> evils they would suffer from a change in their form of Government, yielded to their ungrateful importunities, they had the good taste and good sense to select a man for their monarch who was qualified by administrative talents, by personal dignity, and illustrious courage, to give <hi rend="italics">eclat</hi> to his position, and command the respect of foreign nations.
