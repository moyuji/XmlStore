<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>He recapitulated the position that the present territory of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> was unsuited to slave labor, while there was in the <rs>South</rs> such a deficiency as to lead to the serious contemplation of re-opening the <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slave trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>With regard to the apprehension of the <rs>South</rs> becoming overrun with slaves, thus converting it into a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> <placeName reg="Republica Dominicana" key="tgn,7005388">San Domingo</placeName>, he argued that the tendency was the other way &mdash; that the demand always exceeded the supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>It had been urged by the gentleman from <placeName key="tgn,2002137" n="1.000 2" reg="albemarle, virginia, united states">Albemarle</placeName>, that in <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> the <rs>South</rs> would become Africanized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>His own opinion always had been that it would be hundreds of years before the <rs>South</rs> would require an outlet for the surplus of her slave population; and to sustain this view, he read from a speech in the <orgName n="United States Senate" type="senate">Senate of the United States</orgName>, by <persName n="Hammond,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Hammond,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hammond</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, within the past year, in reply to a <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> <rs type="role2">Senator</rs>, (<persName n="Doolittle,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Doolittle,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Doolittle</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Wisconsin" key="tgn,7007922">Wisconsin</placeName>,) in regard to this very apprehension.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/><persName n="Hammond,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Hammond,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hammond</surname></persName> assumed the position that the <rs>South</rs> was capable, within its present limits, of sustaining a slave population of <num value="200000000">200,000,000</num>, and utterly repudiated the idea of a necessity for expansion in this respect, although he did not surrender any of the rights of the <rs>South</rs> to future acquisition. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> He believed with <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Hammond,Senator,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Hammond,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Hammond</surname></persName></hi> that the <rs>South</rs> was fully able to take care of itself, when the question arises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>He conceived that it would be for the interest of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> to stop the drain of slaves to the cotton States, and by the employment of more slave labor in the <rs>West</rs>, secure a homogeneousness of interest throughout the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The cotton States were quite as dependent upon us for their supply of slave labor, as we were upon them for any market for a surplus of the productions of labor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> It was the duty of the <rs>North</rs> to speak out upon the subject; the time for settlement had come, and he thought it should be a comprehensive settlement &mdash; the <name>Territorial</name> question ought to be settled at once and forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>He was aware of the apprehension at the <rs>South</rs> that the doctrine of the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision could not prevail permanently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The true doctrine, he thought, was expressed in <num value="1">one</num> section of the report of the <rs>Committee</rs>, that &#x0022;the <rs>Territories</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> constitutes a trust, to be administered by the <rs>General Government</rs>, for the common benefit of the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and any policy in respect to such Territories calculated to confer greater benefits on the people of <num value="1">one</num> part of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> than on the people of another part, is contrary to equality and prejudicial to the rights of some for whose equal benefit the trust was created.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>If the equal admission of slave labor and free labor into any Territory, excites unfriendly conflict between the systems, a fair partition of the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> ought to be made between them, and each system ought to be protected within the limits assigned to it, by the laws necessary for its proper development.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> He contended that no species of property in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> should have more protection than the peculiar property of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>He claimed full and perfect equality with the people of the <rs>North</rs>, and would consent to no restriction that was not applied to the property of citizens in every section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>He would not consent that a wolf's head should be put upon the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>, to attract to it the opposition of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>These were his sentiments, and they were such as he had always entertained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>He then went into an argument upon the amendments to the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>, proposed by the <rs>Committee</rs>, which he considered a decided improvement upon the <name>Crittenden</name> propositions, in so far as they afforded a more certain protection to slavery in territory south of <num value="36.30">36.30</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Alluding to the protection of the common law, he declared as a lawyer that when the legal profession ceased to be a safe depository of private right, <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> liberty would no longer be worth preserving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Let fanaticism howl as it might, the rights of the people would be secure.--With regard to future acquisitions of territory, he laid down the position that constitutional amendments were utterly valueless, for treaties would have to be made with people living beyond the limits of our constitutional law. We had an example of this in the acquisition of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, during the <name>Administration</name> of the distinguished gentleman from <placeName reg="Charles City, Charles City, Virginia" key="tgn,2111055">Charles City</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>He (<rs type="role">Mr.</rs> B.) was perfectly satisfied to trust all matters touching the acquisition of new territory to the hands of Southern <rs type="role2">Senators</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>For himself, he did not incline to any further expansion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="3Section">third section</orgName>, in regard to the protection of slavery in the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>, and the inter-State slave trade, covered the whole subject completely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>It refused to the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> party the right ever to legislate upon the subject of slavery in the <name>States</name> or in the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>It proposed to engraft upon the <rs>Constitution</rs> a perpetual prohibition against the abolition of slavery anywhere, except by the unanimous consent of all the <name>States</name>.--This, he thought, would drive the last nail into the coffin of the &#x0022;irrepressible conflict.&#x0022;He then proceeded to argue the point relative to the tax on slaves, alluding to the position advanced by the gentleman from <persName><roleName n="Princess">Princess</roleName> <foreName>Anne</foreName></persName>, (<persName n="Wise,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:Wise,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName>.) </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> The <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Chairman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Chairman,nomatch:0"><surname>Chairman</surname></persName>,</hi> warned the spectators that if such a demonstration were repeated, the gallery and lobby would be cleared. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> This led to another explanation from <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Wise,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="mostcommon:Wise,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName>,</hi> who argued that Congress was invested with the power of limitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Taxation, direct or indirect, rested wholly with Congress, and when the <rs>North</rs> wished to lay a tax upon slaves, they could only lay it upon <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".2">fifths</num> of the slave population, while their own white heads were taxed <hi rend="italics">per capita.</hi> </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Wise,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00031" reg="mostcommon:Wise,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName></hi> said he would be glad to take, as a pupil, <num value="1">one</num> who had not yet learned the A, B, C, of the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>[Laughter.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Baldwin,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00033" reg="nearbymention:Baldwin,John,B.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Baldwin</surname></persName></hi> continued to argue upon the propositions, which, he believed, covered the entire scope in which the <rs>Constitution</rs> required amendment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>As every point of objection urged to the <orgName n="Peace Conference" type="conference">Peace Conference</orgName> propositions had been removed, in a spirit of deference to those who had criticised them, he thought they ought now to command the support of the distinguished gentleman from <placeName reg="Charles City, Charles City, Virginia" key="tgn,2111055">Charles City</placeName>, and others who thought with him. He (<rs type="role">Mr.</rs> B.) would not consent to a <hi rend="italics">final</hi> settlement of the question by a <orgName n="Border Conference" type="conference">Border Conference</orgName>, or any other conference; but would reserve it for the ratification or rejection of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>He thought when everything had been settled to the satisfaction of the <rs>Border States</rs>--when our Southern sisters saw that the question was settled in a manner satisfactory to <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, they would return and look the issue sternly in the face; and when they thought of the stars and stripes under which they had marched in a career of prosperity, they would hardly refuse to come back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>But should they refuse, it would still be the duty of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> to look after her own rights, and take care of her own interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>He then argued that so far as the agricultural interests of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> were concerned, she would be infinitely better off to remain as she was, than to secede from the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>The Cotton States raised neither breadstuffs nor live stock to any extent, but they must have them, and would purchase of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>In laying their tariff, they had left these articles duty free.--They were bound to have them, and could not do without them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>There would be a free access to their market, and be could see no reason for seceding in order to get to it. If <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> were to secede, there would moreover be a line of custom-houses between her and the <rs>North</rs>, and a protective tariff would cut us off from all articles of material necessity that we wanted to buy. He knew but little about manufactures, in regard to which interest allusion had been made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>He did not, however, wish to introduce the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> system into <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> &mdash; those immense corporations of which we heard so much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>He preferred the peaceful pursuits which at present characterized the inhabitants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>He protested against breaking up this great theatre on which the experiment of free trade was in process of splendid development. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/> In conclusion, <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Baldwin,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="nearbymention:Baldwin,John,B.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Baldwin</surname></persName></hi> apologized for having so long detained the <rs>Committee</rs> in listening to an exposition of his views.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>When he looked along the line of his duty and saw the number of steps that were necessary to accomplish the object of his hope, his mind often quailed, and he trembled with apprehension.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>He believed, however, that it was his duty to walk in the path which he had marked out. If he performed well the patriotic duty which he had under taken, he could safely leave the rest in the hands of the great Disposer of events.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>He would, therefore, turn neither to the right nor to the left, but would march straight on, in the line of duty and of right, and leave the result to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>He said if he had been told <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> ago that he would be in this presence, and discussing these subjects, he would have listened with incredulity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>For <measure n="25years" type="date">twenty-five years</measure> he had been buried among his own peaceful and quiet pursuits, but some, who thought they saw in him the elements which might be used in this crisis, had disinterred him, and sent him here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>His people were lovers of peace, and he promised them that he would do all he could for the adjustment of our national difficulties without sacrificing the honor of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>He had waited, and now he saw no ground for any such hope.--Years ago, in the <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName></orgName>, he stood with <num value="40">forty</num> others, including the gentleman from <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName> (<persName n="Preston,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00036" reg="mostcommon:Preston,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Preston</surname></persName>,) and the gentleman from <placeName reg="Henry, Marshall, Illinois" key="tgn,2028261">Henry</placeName>, (<persName n="Gravely,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00037" reg="mostcommon:Gravely,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gravely</surname></persName>,) in doing all he could for the protection of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>He knew they would still be found on the side of State Rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Others had cried out, crucify her!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>but he was glad that some of those most distinguished on that side were now covered with sackcloth and penitential ashes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>In this connection he alluded to the gentleman from <placeName reg="Orange, Essex, New Jersey" key="tgn,2065747">Orange</placeName>, (<persName n="Morton,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00038" reg="mostcommon:Morton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Morton</surname></persName>.)

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Bruce,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00040" reg="mostcommon:Bruce,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bruce</surname></persName></hi> went on to pay his respects to <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Moore,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00041" reg="mostcommon:Moore,James,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Moore</surname></persName>,</hi> of <placeName key="tgn,2002186" n="1.000 7" reg="rockbridge, virginia, united states">Rockbridge</placeName>, and <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Baldwin,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00042" reg="nearbymention:Baldwin,John,B.,,"><surname>Baldwin</surname></persName>,</hi> of <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName>, of whom he had little hope, and made humorous allusions which excited the merriment of the members as well as the spectators.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>The argument of the gentleman from <placeName key="tgn,2002137" n="1.000 2" reg="albemarle, virginia, united states">Albemarle</placeName> (<hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Holcombe,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00043" reg="mostcommon:Holcombe,J.,R.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Holcombe</surname></persName></hi>) as to the impossibility of turning back the tide of fanaticism, he considered irresistible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>The subject of slavery he said was not a question of dollars and cents &mdash; a question of raising and lowering the tariff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>Referring to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> introduction of the institution here, he traced its growth to the point when it had become so intertwined with our social habits, that to break it up would be ruinous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>He then adverted to the unconstitutional acts of the <rs>Northern States</rs>, and showed that hatred of slavery was so firmly engrafted upon the <rs>Northern</rs> mind, that to eradicate it would be impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>He was of opinion it would go on, until it finally came to a war with the sword.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>He was willing to make <num value="1">one</num> more effort, and that would be to put forth an ultimatum in the name of the people of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, providing for the resumption of her sovereign powers in the event of its failure. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/> He proposed to enter into the delicate task of calculating the value of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>He asked what had this Confederacy done for us?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>He did not mean to say that good things had not been done, but he wanted to know what they were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>It had been said that it secured us protection abroad; that <num value="1">one</num> had only to say &#x0022;I am an <orgName n="American Citizen" type="newspaper">American citizen</orgName>,&#x0022; to throw around himself a shield in any foreign land.--He knew that when a citizen of the <rs>South</rs> went abroad and said this, it secured him protection; it secured him from incarceration; but he was met by the sneering remark--&#x0022;But you are a slaveholder.&#x0022; This had been the effect of the teaching of Northern prints, and such was not the kind of protection he wanted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>We were told, too, that our commerce was protected by the stars and stripes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>Alas, we had no commerce &mdash; commerce all belonged to the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>Those great staples, tobacco, cotton and rice, needed no protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>The South enjoyed a monopoly in that trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>We were told, however, that our sugar wanted protection; and in this connection he argued that this production would be better off without protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>The wool trade was also considered, the speaker assuming that in this, as well as in other respects, there was no protection except in so far as the <rs>North</rs> was obliged to protect it in order to protect its own interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>The advantages of protection to the <rs>South</rs>, as well as the dangers of a border war, in the event of secession, he thought had been greatly overrated. </p>

The <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs>, in a sketch of his speech, says: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/> He contrasted the strength of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> with that of the <name>Colonies</name> at the time of their struggle for independence, and showed that we had more territory, more wealth, and more men than our fathers had when they asserted and maintained their independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>Our perfect system of government would attract the border slave States, and we would soon have more States, but even if they choose to stay where they are in the old Union, we still had territory enough for an empire &mdash; more than twice as much as some of the most powerful nations in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, with a soil and climate and productions superior to any in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>With a good government and a brave, virtuous and intelligent people, we had nothing to fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>With less public debt than the <rs>Northern States</rs>, we have greater resources, and were better able to sustain an independent Government.--If we were true to ourselves, a brilliant future was before us &mdash; our Confederacy was destined to become the nucleus of a great controlling power on this continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>Our policy was peace with all nations &mdash; with our late confederates and the rest of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>The olive branch was the emblem of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>In lieu of it we presented the cotton plant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>He had been frequently asked whether our revolution could be consummated without war.--He had thought at <num value="1">one</num> time that war was inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>But, he would say, that of late the prospect was less threatening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>The <rs>North</rs> had nothing to gain by war, and the adoption of a war, instead of a peace policy, on their part, could only be accounted for on the hypothesis that &#x0022;those whom the <name>Gods</name> would destroy they <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> make mad.&#x0022; To talk of coercion was simply absurd &mdash; it was an impossibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>He thought when the <rs>Northern States</rs> come to count the cost of the attempt &mdash; for it could only be an attempt &mdash; they would, like the man who was practicing to fight a duel by shooting with a musket at the size of a man marked out on a barn door, and who, when he found he had put some <num value="14">fourteen</num> shot in the mark, came to the conclusion that the weapon was too destructive, and that he would not fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>He thought the <rs>North</rs> when it came to contemplate the consequences would wisely conclude that coercion would be too <hi rend="italics">destructive.</hi> There was no necessity for war. The old Union was a contract between the <name>States</name>, and it was a principle of law that civil contracts can be annulled by mutual consent of the parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>Therefore all the present <orgName n="U. S. Congress" type="Congress">United States Congress</orgName> had to do was simply to consent that the contract with the seceded States be annulled and settle matters amicably.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>But while the prospect of collision was not so unfavorable as it had been, it was well for us to be prepared with stout hearts and strong arms to meet any emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>Until our revolution is consummated and our new Government firmly established, it is proper that we should be well prepared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>It was for this that in arranging the tariff higher duties had been assessed than would ordinarily be necessary for the support of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>We wanted armaments and men, and to provide the means higher duties had been laid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>In time of peace an average of <num value="0.1">ten per cent.</num> on our imports would give us <num value="15000000">fifteen millions</num> of dollars, ample for all purposes of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>The future was before us; whether it was to be peace or war, depended on others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>He would only say let us be prepared &mdash; let us keep our armor bright and our powder dry. </p> </q><bibl n="The Republican,"></bibl></cit> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>Tradition says of the men she elected to the <rs>Convention</rs> called to pass upon it, a majority were pledged to vote against its adoption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>It is certain that a majority of the body did vote against the ratification at <num value="1">one</num> time; and that not until a clause was inserted in the ordinance of ratification, protesting that <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> would resume the powers granted when they should be perverted to her injury and oppression, was the small vote obtained in its favor, of <num value="89">89</num> to <num value="79">79</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>Then, and since, she has always been able to cause these views to be at least respected by the <rs>North</rs>, rallying as she did, with few and occasional exceptions, the combined <rs>South</rs> on her side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>It has made haste to signalize its victory, and to give instance of its intentions, by enacting a tariff law odiously protective, odiously in conflict with the political teachings and principles of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, odiously unconstitutional in every aspect in which <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> has been wont to view the instrument of Federal compact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>That section has grown so great in population, and so hostile in purpose, as to have elected a President by its own exclusive vote, pledged to doctrines opposed to those which have ever been cherished by <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> as the apple of her eye; and that <rs type="role2">President</rs> comes to his capital, proclaiming on his way, as if in derision of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> and exultation over her political discomfiture, that a sovereign State of this Confederacy is but as a county in a Commonwealth. </p>
