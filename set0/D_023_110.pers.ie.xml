<head>Strange and yet true.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> When the evening lamps are lighted, or, rather, just before that operation &mdash; say, in the little interval which follows the retirement of the ladies from the dining-room, and precedes the appearance of the laughing, skeptical faces left temporarily below &mdash; a grain of ghost talk mingles, not inharmoniously, with the gentle and domestic topics invoked by the subdued light and confidential feeling of the hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The treatment of the subject is necessarily superficial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/><measure n="20minutes" type="date">Twenty minutes</measure> will not suffice for a dive into philosophic deeps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Facts are simply adduced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Theme and proposition are laid bare, and left so for any after manipulations profounder thinkers please.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Nevertheless, from the pabulum (often exceedingly raw) supplied by these little conversations may be deduced a whole garden of thought worthy the attention of the most earnest sage. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> Whatever be the cause, the fact will hardly be disputed that a taste for the supernatural has greatly augmented of late among the educated classes of society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>It has, indeed, as might be expected, abandoned its ancient form of bald credulity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>We neither believe in the ghost nor shoot him; We require to know something of his nature who walks uninvited into our dwelling, and what may be his immediate business there, but not with rudeness nor intolerance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>In a word, the indulgent spirit of the time is the welcome child of progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>As every age stamps itself upon the roll of time with the seal of some grand discovery-- as every successive year reveals its half-suspected wonders &mdash; the mind becomes less and less inclined to impose limits upon that vast unexplored ocean, which, like the natural horizon, seems to know no bound but <name n="God" type="God">God</name>--and man, as he grows wiser, grows humbler. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> To this improved feeling, and this better discipline of reason, we are indebted for many an interesting narrative which would else have never passed the bounds of a family circle; or in doing so, would have at least been carefully denuded of such corroboration as name, place, and time afford.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>In the incidents hereafter to be related these have been supplied without scruple, and without desire for any greater reticence than the editor in his discretion may impose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The circumstances of each case have been verified with unusual care, because another object than simple curiosity suggested the inquiry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Still it may be proper to call attention to the fact that persons who have been, or who have conceived themselves to have been, the witnesses of so-called supernatural appearances, are, in recalling the occurrence, never wholly free from the dominion of that exalted feeling which accompanied it, and which is ill calculated for minute and accurate detail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>He, therefore, who undertakes to relate a ghost story at <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>-hand may have the difficult task of rendering incoherences in such a manner as shall not bring down unjust doubt upon what is no less correct than clear. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> To assist analysis, we must compare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>To aid comparison, the least possible reserve should unite with the closest possible adherence to facts, so far as facts can be ascertained after passing through strongly susceptible imaginations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Even were these extra-natural occurrences not explicable (whish we hold them in every case to be,) there is surely nothing terrible or revolting in the pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>It is for example; a simple, touching, and beautiful faith that the last earthly regards of the liberated spirit should be fixed upon its best beloved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>If such be the work of a mocking spirit, it wears a wonderfully heavenly dress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/><q>&#x0022;I am a ghost,&#x0022;</q> says Wolfran, in the <rs>Fool</rs>'s Tragedy: </p> <cit><q> <lg type="stanza"> <l>Tremble not, Fear not me: </l><l>The dead are ever good and innocent, </l><l>And love the living.

<p> To proceed at once to illustration, here are <num value="2">two</num> instances of <q>&#x0022;intuition,&#x0022;</q> both brief and true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is supplied by a gentleman well known in <name>French</name> literary circles, whom it induced to bestow much attention on that and kindred subjects. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> In <dateStruct value="1845--"><year reg="1845">1845</year></dateStruct> he was visiting a lady of his acquaintance at <placeName key="tgn,7008929" n="1.000 4" reg="rouen,departement de la seine-maritime,haute-normandie,france,europe">Rouen</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>They were engaged in earnest conversation on the subject of the future prospects of the lady's children, the youngest of whom &mdash; a girl of <num value="18">eighteen</num>--sat working beside them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Suddenly the latter started from her seat with a loud shriek, and threw herself into her mother's arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>On being questioned as to the cause of her agitation, she pointed to a sofa, and, weeping bitterly, declared she had seen descend upon it the figure of her elder sister, <placeName key="tgn,7017545" n="1.000 10" reg="Natchez, Adams, Mississippi">Rosalie</placeName>, then on a visit to some relations at or near <placeName key="tgn,7008927" n="1.000 4" reg="le havre,departement de la seine-maritime,haute-normandie,france,europe">Havre</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The countenance of the phantom was pale and death-stricken.--This occurred at <time value="4oclock">4 o'clock</time> in the afternoon of the <date value="09-17">17th September</date>. <measure n="2days" type="date">Two days</measure> after, tidings arrived that <persName n="Rosalie,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Rosalie,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosalie</surname></persName> L &mdash; had been unhappily drowned in a boating excursion at <placeName key="tgn,7008927" n="1.000 4" reg="le havre,departement de la seine-maritime,haute-normandie,france,europe">Havre</placeName>, at (it was affirmed) the precise moment of the appearance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> As another instance, here is a circumstance minutely related by <rs type="role2">Monsieur</rs> M--, a retired <name>French</name> officer, in a letter to a friend: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> &#x0022;Left an orphan at an early age, I was brought up under the care of a kind-hearted <name n="God" type="God">god</name>-mother, who could scarcely have cherished me more had I been her own offspring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>She resided at <placeName key="tgn,7009229" n="1.000 10" reg="Harfleur,Departement de la Seine-Maritime,Haute-Normandie,France,Europe">Harfleur</placeName>, and, being in easy circumstances, refused me nothing that could contribute to my youthful pleasure, keeping my pockets withal comfortably lined with that material which rendered my frequent visits to the <name>Sunday</name> fetes in the neighborhood doubly agreeable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion I had started, as usual, in company with a band of young vagabonds like myself, to attend a fete at Quillebouf, on the opposite side of the <name>Seine</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> &#x0022;Contrary to my natural habit, I felt uneasy and depressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>An inexplicable feeling of gloom hung upon my mind, and neither my own efforts nor the raillery of my companions could drive it away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>I had indeed left my good protectress confined by illness to her bed, but I was not aware that she was in any danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>However, the cloud upon my mind, far from dispersing, momentarily increased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>If I joined as usual in the different sports, I was slow and unskillful; and in the war of wit that generally accompanied our games had not a word to say for myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>We had engaged in a match of skittles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>It was my turn to deliver the ball, and I was standing, half pensively, poising it in my hand, when I distinctly heard a soft voice pronounce my name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>I started, and turned round, hastily asking who had spoken. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/> &#x0022; &#x0027; Nobody,&#x0027; replied those around me.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> &#x0022;I insisted that I had heard a woman's voice say &#x0027; M--&#x0027; &#x0022; &#x0027; Bah ! you're dreaming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Play away.&#x0027; &#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> &#x0022;Hardly had the ball quitted my hand when a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time I heard my name pronounced in a soft and plaintive tone, but fainter than the former.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Again I inquired who called me. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> &#x0022;No <num value="1">one</num> present had heard the sound. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> &#x0022;It struck me that some <num value="1">one</num> of the party was playing a trick upon me, in order to increase my evident melancholy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Nevertheless, under the influence of some impression caused by the plaintive summons, I refused to play any longer, and presently returned alone to Harfleur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>On reaching my godmother's house I was shocked to learn that she had expired during the afternoon, pronouncing my name twice, and breathing her last sigh at the moment of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> summons I had heard.-- </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> These facts are well known to some <num value="12">twelve</num> or <num value="15">fifteen</num> people at Harfleur and at Quilleb&#x0153;uf, most of whom are still (in <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct>) living, and were I to live <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> the sound and the impression will never depart from my memory.&#x0022; But, of course, these so-called facts had their common source in the narrator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Therefore, as a question of evidence, no corroboration is gained by their being known to the dozen or <num value="15">fifteen</num> people still living. </p> </q><bibl n="Monsieur M--, a retired French officer"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/> The heroine of our next illustration is <rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> D--, an English lady. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/> When, <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> ago, <rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> D &mdash; became a widow, it pleased the brother of her husband to dispute the dispositions of the latter's will &mdash; a proceeding the more annoying as the provision made for the widow, was already extremely moderate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Ultimately an appeal was made to Chancery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The suit lasted <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, and caused <rs type="role2">Mrs</rs>. D &mdash; the utmost vexation and anxiety, when at length the law, finding those claims indisputable, which had never been anything else, decided in her favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Some short time after this, <rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> D &mdash; was residing in L &mdash; Place, <address><street n="Brighton street">Brighton</street></address>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>A friend, <rs type="role2">Miss</rs>--, usually shared her bedroom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Both were lying awake <num value="1">one</num> morning about <time value="8oclock">8 o'clock</time>, when <rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> D--, with some surprise, saw her friend rise up suddenly in bed, clasp her hands, and sink back again on the pillow in a profound sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Strange as seemed the movement, it was so evident to <rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> D &mdash; that her friend was really in a tranquil slumber that she made no effort to disturb her. A minute elapsed, when the door quietly opened, and there seemed to enter a figure which she believed to be supernatural.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>She describes her feelings with great minuteness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>She owned that, by nature, she was somewhat nervous; her impressions, as she afterward remembered them, on this occasion had not the slightest intermixture of fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>She was conscious of a reverential awe, such as might become the witness of a revelation overruling the accepted law of nature, united with a feeling of intense curiosity as to the object of the apparition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Gliding through the subdued light, the figure had all the appearance, gait, and manner of her deceased husband; until, passing round the room, and sinking down into an armchair that stood nearly opposite her bed, turned slightly aside, the figure presented its profile, and <rs type="role2">Mrs</rs>. D &mdash; instantly recognized her connection and late opponent, <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> W. D--, at that time residing in the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>No sooner had the mysterious visitor sat down than he raised his clasped hands, as in passionate entreaty; but though the spectral lips appeared to move, as in harmony with the gesture, no sound was audible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/><num value="3">Three</num> times the hands were lifted in the same earnest manner, then the figure rose and retired as it came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Some nervous reaction followed its disappearance, for <rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> D--'s maid appearing a minute or <num value="2">two</num> later, found her mistress trembling violently, and much agitated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Nevertheless, she quickly regained her self-possession, and calmly related what she had seen both to <rs type="role2">Miss</rs> F &mdash; and the maid, the former being unable to recall anything unusual, and only knowing that she had fallen asleep again contrary to her own intention. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>It was daylight, and she was broad awake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>The door opened, but <rs type="role2">Lady</rs>--, concluding it was her maid, did not raise her head until a remarkable-looking figure, passing between her bed and the window, walked up to the fire-place, when, reflected in the mirror which hung above, <rs type="role2">Lady</rs> &mdash; recognized the features of her step-son, <rs type="role">Dr.</rs> J.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/> The figure turned slowly round, and she then became aware that the object he carried was a dead child, the body being swathed round and round in a large <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> scarf of remarkable workmanship, which <rs type="role2">Lady</rs> &mdash; had presented to <rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> J.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>As she gazed the outline of the figures became indistinct &mdash; invisible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>They were lost in the familiar objects of the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>She lay down and thought the matter over, resolving to mention it to no <num value="1">one</num> until the return of her husband, then absent in attendance on an illustrious household.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>His experience would decide whether her physical health offered any solution of the phenomenon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/> On hearing her story her husband immediately looked at his lady's tongue and felt her pulse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>Both organs perfect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>Of her nerves he had seen proof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>Touching veracity she was truth itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>All his skill could devise nothing better than a recommendation to patience, and to see what came of it. In the mean time the day and hour were noted down, and the next advices from T &mdash; awaited with more than usual interest. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/> A favorite theory lays it down as law that it requires <num value="2">two</num> minds to produce <num value="1">one</num> ghost.--There must be, on the <num value="1">one</num> side, the power of protraction of the image; on the other, that of receptivity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>Perfectly conscious, as he declared, from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, that the object he beheld was not of this world, the steady soldier fixed his eyes on the apparition, careful only to catch its every movement, and impress the whole scene with accuracy on his memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>The figure moved slowly to the side of the bed, gazed with a sad and wistful expression on the sleeper a face, and then, as though reluctantly, died away into the gloom. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/> <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs> M &mdash; then awoke his wife and related what had occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>A furious gust of wind and rain seemed to burst in with the opening door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>A long pause succeeds, after which the butler was heard reascending to his apartment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/><rs type="role2">Lady</rs> S--'s curiosity was sufficiently aroused to induce her to summon her maid, who slept in an adjoining room, and send her to question the butler as to the untimely visitor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>The answer returned was that, on opening the door, no <num value="1">one</num> was to be seen.--The night, though rough, was not very dark, and neither on the graveled approach nor on the broad lawns could be discerned a living thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>But for so many having heard the bell the butler would have imagined it a dream. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/> Gradually the household resumed its repose, when, at <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time>, a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> summons startled everybody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>There was no mistake now, for the bell had not ceased its impatient vibrations when the butler, with several other servants, set foot on the stairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>Again the storm dashed into the house, and nothing but the storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>No human shape was visible without, nor were any footprints to be traced on the smooth gravel sheltered by the porch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>As they were about to close the door for the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time <rs type="role2">Lady</rs> S--'s maid appeared on the landing and beckoned, with a white, scared face, to those below </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>A short time after, the spirit of the departed stood, in a dream, by the bedside of her friend, <rs type="role2">Madam</rs> L--, and, with a countenance distorted with indescribable agony, implored the latter to interest in her behalf some <q>&#x0022;great, strong soul,&#x0022;</q> that might wrestle for her in prayer, and emancipate the afflicted spirit, if it might be, from its present intolerable condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>This condition she described as <num value="1">one</num> of an eager longing to repent, but of perpetual contention with some terrible hindrance, only removable through the means suggested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/> Soon after, the apparition revisited <rs type="role2">Madame</rs> L--.
