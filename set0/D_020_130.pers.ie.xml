<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> <hi rend="italics">Editors Dispatch:</hi>--In your paper of Saturday you make a suggestion against distilling grain into whiskey, only sufficient for <hi rend="italics">medical purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/></hi> The question arises, How much is necessary for medical purposes?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>It is my opinion, after <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> observation, and the field extensive, that our people are killing soldiers more rapidly by the indiscriminate use of whiskey than any <num value="1">one</num> agent in existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The cry from <num value="1">one</num> end of the army to the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>On the other hand, when a whiskey drinker is sent to <num value="1">one</num> of our hospitals with camp fever his case is hopeless &mdash; constitution broken down, his very existence artificial, and every organ functionably deranged with a low insidious disease, girdling the very centre of life and stopping nutrition. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> I have had hundreds of patients recently under my direct supervision, and as soon as I learn <num value="1">one</num> of them is the habitual drinker I despair of his recovery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>This is the history of all diseases that appear among a mess of men. It is so in cholera, and when yellow fever breaks out in <num value="1">one</num> of our Southern cities, the departing knell of many a dram drinker is sounded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> Besides this, it is demoralizing the men of our country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>I was greatly astonished to find men in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> who I had known in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> as sober, discreet citizens &mdash; members of the different churches &mdash; some deacons and official members &mdash; even preachers &mdash; in the daily and constant habit of drinking whiskey for their health, and have often been urged to drink myself <q>&#x0022;to keep off sickness&#x0022;</q> Members of the <rs>Medical Staff</rs> should check the mighty tide that bears upon its bosom such destructive consequences &mdash; destroying the health of the army, degrading and brutalizing the noble spirit that actuated the war, and in forming habits that will &mdash; if spared to live in peace with the world &mdash; make them enemies to brother, mother, sister, and even themselves I have looked at this thing in sorrow, and it is only a duty I owe to my country &mdash; my noble, generous-hearted, brave countrymen, that I should thus speak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Come, soldiers, if you would sustain your characters, as brave and chivalric, be temperate; if you desire long life, be temperate; if prosperity and happiness, never drink whiskey, and if a peaceful, tranquil home on the verge of eternity, and a blissful home with the good, don't drink whiskey. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>He promised to remember him in his prayers, and then bid him an affectionate good-bye.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>After going through the wards, shaking hands with all the patients, he turned towards the door, and with many <q>&#x0022;adieus&#x0022; </q> double-quicked it across the common. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/> I have told this story merely as an introduction to a point or <num value="2">two</num> about the medical corps of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>I have seen several articles of late which reflect upon them severely, and, if we speak of them as a class, very unjustly &mdash; Undoubtedly there are those in the service who are incompetent and dangerous; but in what department of the army, or in what walk in civil life is there that some &mdash; nay many &mdash; bad and uneducated men cannot be found? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/> I have seen much suffering among the sick, and have seen some cases of neglect on the part of the <rs type="role" reg="medical-Officer">medical officers</rs>; but I have also heard them abused for neglect of duty when they were not in the least to blame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>If proper provision is not made for the sick; if the hospitals are not well supplied; if there is not a sufficient number of ambulances, or if transportation by railroad is not furnished, the medical men are not responsible, and in comes a general complaint of the incompetency of the corps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Who thinks for a moment what a Surgeon has to do, besides the ordinary attention to the sick?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>He has to be physician, surgeon, undertaker, grave- digger, and sometimes attend to the burial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>He has to provide for the sick; furnish proper food; buy eggs, chickens, meat, medicine, straw, blankets, and every necessary; establish hospitals; watch the policing of the camps, and is kept busy nearly all day in signing requisitions, vouchers, furloughs, and discharges.--These are but few of the duties that devolve upon the <rs>Surgeons</rs> in the field, but they are enough for my purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>Now, why not have a medical commissary and quartermaster to attend to these details and leave the <rs>Surgeon</rs> free to attend to his patients?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>His mind should be free from accounts and red-tape routine, and only occupied by the actual care of the men under his charge. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/> There are many errors in the <orgName n="Quartermaster Department" type="department">quartermaster's department</orgName> that should be corrected, before the <rs type="role" reg="medical-Officer">medical officers</rs> are censured too severely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>There are faults in the <orgName n="Commissary Department" type="department">commissary department</orgName> that should be corrected before the sick can have the care they require.--Some time ago a Surgeon had a number of sick men, but had no hospital to put them in. There was none at <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName>, or at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, and he concluded to send them to a town on the railroad, where a State hospital had been established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>In order to get them off, certain papers had to be made out and signed by the <rs type="role" reg="Medical-Director">Medical Director</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>The sick men taken to <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, in ambulances, and the papers sent in. After a time they came back, no action having been taken upon them because they were not made out in the proper form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>Meanwhile the train had gone, there was no place to put the invalids in, and men, racked with pain, weakened by disease, and some suffering with burning fever, were forced to lie out, without food and without scanty shelter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>No matter what the result might be, the papers must be made out correctly &mdash; the rules of the establishment could not be violated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/> The surgeon, who was a man celebrated in private practice, but not familiar with the army regulations and forms, did his best to set matters right, and finally succeeded, but not until the poor men had spent hours of suffering and had undergone exposure enough to send half of them into kingdom come What wonder that many of them died, and that the remainder are still lingering in buildings over which floats the yellow, pestilential flag?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>What wonder there should be complaints from their friends at home?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>The regulations must be strictly obeyed; the rules of the establishment must not be violated; <persName n="Bosch,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="nearbymention:Bosch,William,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bosch</surname></persName> must be flayed alive, if his certificate says so; but let the responsibility rest where it belongs, and not upon the patient surgeons, who try to do their duty to the sick and to their country under most discouraging and disheartening circumstances. </p>

<head>Response of <persName n="Adams,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00244" reg="mostcommon:Adams,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/> <hi rend="italics">My <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Mayer</foreName></persName>, Ladies and Gentlemen:</hi>--In behalf of my brethren of the <rs>Corps Diplomatic</rs>, I desire to express our grateful thanks for the compliment which you have paid it. I take pride in being a member of that body, not for any trifling distinction it may give me, but because it opens an opportunity for doing good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>Whatever may have been said of diplomacy, it has ever seemed to me <num value="1">one</num> of the great inventions of modern times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>Its mission is to preserve peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>In antiquity, the quarrels of nations were immediately followed by war. The sword was the only negotiation, the victorious chieftain commonly ended by dictating terms of humiliation to his fallen enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>All this has been materially changed, now that negotiation always precedes war, and very often averts it altogether.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>Indeed, it may safely be said that the chain of relations established by diplomacy furnishes perpetual means for the restoration of friendly feeling between nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>When they are rushing into a state of mutual tradition, either accidentally or by the agency of ill-tempered mischief-makers on both sides, (for such people will always be found in every community,) then is felt the value of an authorized agency ever present to explain mistakes, to correct misapprehensions, and to retract errors in season &mdash; to check the growth of the trouble and restore good feeling. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/> In these latter days few Governments go to war for the mere love it. The prodigious exhaustion it soon brings on, not less than the growing influence of public opinion throughout the civilized world, teaches a lesson of patience and forbearance that gives full play for the active intervention of a wise negotiator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>A friendly voice may then soothe the waves in the midst of their agitation, and then reduce the surface once more to sunny calm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>[Cheers.] There is, moreover, another beneficial change of a still later date, which I will take the liberty to notice as having happened to the diplomacy of nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>Not a great while ago it had the reputation of being tricky and false &mdash; of taking advantage of the secrecy with which it was conducted to play an unfair game. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/> The history of the past is filled with examples of eminent men, who considered it the height of merit to snow skill in outwitting their neighbors in negotiation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>Indeed, there is an anecdote told, of a very distinguished public character of the last age in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> &mdash; I know not with what justice &mdash; that such was the reputation he had obtained as an adept in deception in <num value="1">one</num> part of his life, that from that time he made up his mind airways to tell the truth, being confident nobody would ever think of believing him, and that thus he might the better conceal his objects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>[A laugh.] Be this as it may, I prefer to appear from the old example of <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>Talleyrand</foreName></persName>, to a later <num value="1">one</num> of a veteran diplomatise of your own country, who, after serving a long career of distinction abroad, has come back to enjoy the honors he has won so well in a green old age at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>I allude to <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Stratford</foreName></persName> do hedcliffe, [cheers,] who, in the testimony he gave before a committees of Parliament, recorded his deliberate opinion that the present practice in negotiation, so far as his experience went, was plain and straightforward, and in good faith; that there was little desire for secrecy merely as a screen for deception, and that most countries acted under a sense of their share of responsibility for honesty of conduct before the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>I say that I prefer to adopt this later theory on my coming in as a member of the <rs>Diplomatic Corps</rs>, because I should scarcely know how to act upon any other. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/> In <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> we are so used to speaking what we think &mdash; perhaps with too much freedom &mdash; and I have got into such a habit of it, I should not be fit to come to play my part here if I were expected by my employers to say what I did not mean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>[Cheers.] Permit me, then, to assure you that my main object has been, and is, to endeavor to continue and perpetuate the friendly relations that have so long existed between the <num value="2">two</num> countries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>[Cheers.] Indeed I see the strongest reasons why they should never be changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>[Cheers.] To be sure there are many points in which we materially disagree, and there will be people on both sides whose disposition will be to magnify them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>You do not approve our democracy; we do not appreciate your distinctions of rank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>You think us altogether too free and easy in our ways; we consider you as lar soon stiff and stately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>All this may be so, and yet so long as there is a broad ocean between us, there is no reason why we may not indulge our respective tastes without risk of difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>On the other hand, I perceive many and vastly higher particulars in which we harmonize.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>[Cheers.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/> Surely it must be remembered that, with only the exception of the last <measure n="80years" type="date">eighty years</measure>, we claim to be joint heritors with you in all that is great and noble in your past history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>Every bold acroke for liberally, whether civil or religious, is matter of pride for us as it is for you. Magna Charla is a common landmark for us all. And it from this I turn to the field of literature or of science, where, I ask, is there a great name in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> which is not equally venerated in <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>?.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>[Cheers] So, among philosophers, we know no greater guide than <persName n="Bacon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00245" reg="mostcommon:Bacon,nomatch:0"><surname>Bacon</surname></persName>, in science no higher authority than <persName n="Newton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00246" reg="mostcommon:Newton,nomatch:0"><surname>Newton</surname></persName>, and, if I may be permitted to come down to the limits of your own municipality of <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>, there is not a street, nor an alley, nor a lane, which is not scrutinized with eagerness by my countrymen, on account of their associations with persons and events of which they can read at home in the historical or the library productions of the mother country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>[Cheers,] Neither is there a deed of heroism recorded here that does not elicit its tribute of applause in the remotest hamlet of the western hemisphere. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/> I have myself met with the story of Grace <placeName key="tgn,2295265" n="1.000 14" reg="drewry's bluff, chesterfield, virginia">Darling</placeName>'s courage stuck up in the small public room of an sun in an obscure <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> town; so the example of self-devotion of your <persName n="Nightingale,,Florence,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00247" reg="default:Nightingale,Florence,,,"><foreName>Florence</foreName> <surname>Nightingale</surname></persName> [Cheers] has raised the admiration and stimulated the ardor of imitation of many of my fair countrywomen, as it has done of her own. And perhaps I may be permitted here to make an allusion to a higher character, so far as to say that through the breadth of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, from sea to sea, the name of <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty</name>, the <rs>Queen</rs>, is held in the highest honor, [cheers.] not because she is a Queen &mdash; no, that's not the reason, for there have been many Queens whom we do not admire at all &mdash; but because, while a pattern of a daughter, and an example of a wife and a mother, she yet rules like a Christian Sovereign over a noble people.-- [Loud cheers.] It is, then, a community of descent, of language, of literature, of sympathy in all that is good, and noble and true, that teaches the lesson of harmony between our respective peoples.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>I therefore cannot but echo the sentiment with which my <rs type="role" reg="Lord Mayor">Lord Mayor</rs> did me the honor to accompany the mention of my name, and, glancing around to the various points where I see the word inscribed along these walls, I say, also, peace here peace there, peace everywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>These gun-boats of the enemy have lately been in the habit of coming higher up the river than was altogether agreeable, and the lesson given them by the gunners of the <rs>Patrick Henry</rs> may teach them that discretion is the better part of valor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>It appears that, on seeing her, the gun-boats made all possible haste down the river towards the blockading ships, and as she continued the chase, they ran in under the protection of the <term type="ship">frigates</term> <rs type="ship">Cumberland</rs> and <rs type="ship">Congress</rs>, and the guns at <orgName n="Newport News" type="newspaper">Newport News</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/> The <rs>Patrick Henry</rs> opened fire upon them, after getting a desirable position, from her <unclear> </unclear> gun, firing shell; and for us much as half an hour she continued to drop her shell on and around the <term type="ship">frigate</term> <rs type="ship">Congress</rs>, many of which, it is believed, burst on her necks with what effect we shall be unable to determine, as the <rs>Federals</rs> keep all such matters too close.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>The engagement commenced about quarter past <num value="6">six</num>, and lasted <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>. During the time, the gun- boats would frequently sally out from behind the frigates to give the <rs>Patrick Henry</rs> a shot, and on such occasions she would soon force them back by a well-directed shot, several of which, it is believed, struck these gun-boats. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/> <num value="2">Two</num> of them, (there were <num value="4">four</num> altogether,) after receiving a shot from the <rs>Patrick Henry</rs> retired to the immediate vicinity of the wharf at <orgName n="Newport News" type="newspaper">Newport News</orgName>, while the other <num value="2">two</num> kept their position out of harm's way in the rear of the frigates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>They at <num value="1">one</num> time made an attempt to pass up <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James River</placeName> so as to flank the <rs>Patrick Henry</rs>, and when getting well out from under the protection of the frigate's batteries the <rs>Patrick Henry</rs> put chase after them, and they scampered back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>After this they appeared to have become afraid to venture out again, and the <rs>Patrick Henry</rs> had to then remain satisfied with peppering the frigates, which she did, it is said in a masterly and beautiful manner. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/> It is said by those who witnessed the entire engagement, that the <rs>Patrick Henry</rs> was <unclear>ha </unclear> in a thoroughly seaman like manner by those on board, and her guns were worked to perfection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>She played upon the enemy mostly with her after gun, while lying off <orgName n="Newport News" type="newspaper">Newport News</orgName>, and would occasionally back up towards the enemy when she would <unclear></unclear> out of range of her mark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>It is supposed she used her after gun in order to keep the best position to prevent being outflanked, and to keep the enemy from having a chance at her broadside. </p>
