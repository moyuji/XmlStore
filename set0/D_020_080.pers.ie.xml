<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/> &#x0022;That in war men should die from exposure, from fatigue, from insufficient supplies, is intelligible; or that the occupation of a town of <num value="30000">30,000</num> inhabitants by an army of <num value="30000">30,000</num> men, without any sanitary precaution, suddenly doubling the population of the area, and thereby halving the proportion of every accommodation, supplies, water, drainage, sewerage, &#x0026;c., &#x0026;c., should engender disease, is readily understood; but the problem submitted to us is to find the causes of a mortality more than double that of civil life among <num value="60000">60,000</num> men, scattered, in numbers seldom exceeding a <num value="1000">thousand</num> in <num value="1">one</num> place, among a population of <num value="28000000">28,000,000</num>, in time of profound peace, in a country which is not only the healthiest, but which possesses the greatest facility of communication and the greatest abundance of supply in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/> It will be observed that the foot soldiers, though recruited from the same source and breathing the same atmosphere, suffer a rate of mortality much higher than the cavalry.--The causes of the difference are attributed by the writer &mdash; to whom we are indebted for these facts &mdash; to over-crowding and the want of due exercise and employment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>The principal diseases in the <rs>English</rs> army are fever and consumption; the latter being the prevalent malady among the <orgName n="Foot Guards" type="guards">Foot Guards</orgName>, and attributed by some to the atmosphere of pipe clay in which they live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>But as the <rs>Horse Guards</rs> live in the same atmosphere, this cannot be the only reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Over-crowding is the chief cause of the disparity of the death rate between the <num value="2">two</num> classes of the guards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>The Horse Guards have far more spacious and airy barracks, and, besides, their exercise is more varied than that of the foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>It is not believed by the <rs>British</rs> authorities that the high rate of mortality among the <orgName n="Foot Guards" type="guards">Foot Guards</orgName> was owing to the destructive nature of the night duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>On the contrary, the firemen and the police of <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>, and the sailors, whose night duties are more severe than those of the <orgName n="Foot Guards" type="guards">Foot Guards</orgName>, enjoy a high state of health.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>The close and impure air, and the over-crowded barracks, are the real cause of the mortality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>The same fountain of sickness, the close and crowded tents, pitched in open fields, with a blazing sun, and with no adequate means of ventilation, have prostrated more men in our own army than will ever fall by the bullets and bayonets of the enemy. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/> The important elements of exercise and food have also great influence upon the sanitary condition of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>A working man will dig, and his mind is his own; an artisan is interested in the work on which he is engaged; but a soldier has to give you all his attention, and he has nothing to show for the work done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/> In <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName>, it is said, a large proportion of the men chafe and drink themselves to death, under modes of life so opposed to the habits in which they had been reared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>The fault is attributed to the rule of the <rs>English</rs> service which precludes the soldier from making himself useful, the best conducted troops being the engineers, who work at their different trades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>But with this exception, it is said the <rs>English</rs> troops can neither cook, bake, make their clothes, nor their huts, like the <rs>French</rs>, the <rs n="Sardinian" type="ethnic">Sardinians</rs>, and the <name>Turks</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>Before the soldier can be held as fit to undertake his duties to the <rs>State</rs>, he must be made capable of uminfaining everything which may be necessary to his personal care and comfort.&#x0022;</q> Commenting on this admirable council, another <name>British</name> author calls attention to the famous <name>English</name> camps of Aldershon and Shornoliffe, and asks if they fulfill the majority of the conditions calculated to train the soldier for active service?

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/> <q>&#x0022;There are clay, gravel, and sand on the spot, with abundance of small wood that no <num value="1">one</num> will buy not more than <measure n="8miles" type="distance">eight miles distant</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>The buildings would not be such permanent structures as the contractors have put together; we should miss the architectural facades for the officers' quarters, and the &#x0027;moulded cornices&#x0027; described so maliciously by the <hi rend="italics">Times's</hi> correspondent; but we should have serviceable huts, which would last for <num value="8">eight</num> or <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure>. There can be but little doubt that the men would be healthier in them than in vast barracks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/> It is a common complaint that there are too many <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> graduates in our army, and that these officers are unacquainted with the feelings, prejudices, and capacities of volunteers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>Both branches of the complaint are unfounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>Not a <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num>, we presume, of our officers ever graduated of <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>All of those who have been put in high offices have seen service with volunteers, or commanded them in our <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> and <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> wars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>On the other hand, hundreds of our officers, appointed from civil life, never saw, or were engaged in military service of any kind, either with regulars or volunteers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>Despite of their inexperience, they have behaved admirably, and no doubt, most of them, have acquired much valuable military knowledge in the last <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> of active hostilities; but this knowledge has been chiefly acquired from serving with, or under, educated and experienced officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>The school at <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> was <num value="1">one</num> of the best Military Institutes in the world; and its graduates, who have added experience in war, to science learned within its walls, are, generally, the fittest men to plan and prosecute campaigns, and to drill and discipline our troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>There are no martinets among them, no men whose lives have been spent exclusively in camp, and who mistake the regular army for the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>During peace they have been stationed in small bodies, and have held continual intercourse in the civil world around them, and during war they have served with, or commanded, volunteers fresh from the domestic hearth, and from the pursuits of peaceful life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>They combine experience and practical skill with scientific attainments; a knowledge of the outside world with a knowledge of camp life. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>Soldiers were the only man kind with him, and war, prosecuted without definite aim or object, the only respectable human pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>He knew little of a moral worth, because there is no moral worth in a camp of Regulars, and nothing of moral or religious motives or forces, as both religion and morality were ignored by <name>French</name> schools and <name>French</name> armies; and therefore he trusted entirely to superior amounts of money, men, and gunpowder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>Hence, he said, <q> &#x0022;<placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> always takes sides with the heaviest artillery&#x0022;</q> The Cossacks proved to him that he was mistaken; when, however, it was too late to retrieve his error. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/> We have introduced this example and illustration to show that we despise as much as any <num value="1">one</num> the more professional soldier, and concur with those who think that our officers should be acquainted with civil life, yet we deem it much more important that they should be familiar with the art or war. We do not employ for our lawyer the man who never studied law, nor trust our lives when we are sick in the hands of a man who never studied medicine, Nay, we would not get a man to make us a part of those whenever used an awl, and surely, it is an easy in mage <num value="0.5">a half</num> of glides as to <unclear></unclear> as <unclear></unclear> we haul impresses the <unclear> </unclear> can we improvise the officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/> Moral motives, patriotic ardor, and a consciousness of rectitude of purpose, have to far, in a great measure, supplied the place of military skill and experience, both with or soldiers and our officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>Besides, we have been opposed to an enemy who, without the same moral incentives, possesses much less military skill, science, and experience, than we. The ardor with which a conflict of arms begins, evaporates and diminishes as it progresses; and in the long run we shall have to depend chiefly on the number and discipline of our troops, and the skill, courage, and experience of our officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>Death in battle, or from sickness, combined with resignations, will rapidly thin the ranks of our officers, and these places must be chiefly supplied by appointments from civil life, for the want of <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> graduates to fill them, if for no other course. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/> A cloud of smoke enveloped the battle field, which almost hid the combatants, and our brave little garrison watched its dense folds with intense anxiety, waiting for the grand charge of <num value="1000">thousands</num> which they expected, and stood ready to receive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/>At about <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time> it came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>A column of about <num value="8000">8,000</num> men emerged from the forest, and charged, on a run, at the east barricade, next to the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/>Their approach was the signal for breathless anxiety within the breastworks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>The gallant band spoke not a word, but knelt, every man of them, with gun leveled and finger on the trigger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>The swiftly advancing column, emboldened by the silence of the foe, gave forth loud hurrahs and dashed up almost to the muzzles of the guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>Scarcely <num value="50">fifty</num> paces intervened, and they seemed on the point of storming over the works, when a voice of command rang out, and a line of light opened across the breastworks and ran along the entire line like a flash of lightning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>It was like an avalanche of fire sweeping through the tall prairie grass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>The men went down, column after column.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>They struggled to rise again, and fell under the trampling feet of their comrades, who, still impetuous, rushed onward to the fray.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>The smoke had hardly arisen before every gun was loaded, and again the murderous storm of bullets went on its deadly errand, sheathed in flame and smoke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>It crushed through the serried ranks, and mowed the leaders down by columns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>Still they rallied, and, led on by daring officers, again trod over the dead bodies of their comrades with desperate energy.
