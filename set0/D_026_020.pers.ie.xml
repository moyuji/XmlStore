<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Sweeping military bills are not demanded, nor is it necessary to put the old men in the field; and eternal infamy upon that body, state or Confederate, that shall thus destroy the planting interest of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and rear the youths of the land in a more than heathenish ignorance, merely to gratify the zeal without wisdom, of brainless men, who vainly imagine themselves statesmen, generals, and patriots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/> Whilst writing on subjects appertaining to the good of the army, primarily, and, by consequence, to the good of the country, I would take occasion to reprehend in the strongest language possible the tendency among demagogues in and out of Congress to antagonize the army and the people.--What is the army but a port of the people?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>And why should the people have an interest or a feeling not in common with the army?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Surely there are few, if any, who have not made sacrifices in this war, and, whilst all honor belongs to the brave men who have periled their lives in rallying around our standard, I humbly conceive that he who impartially writes the history of these times will not withhold from the good homefolks, in almost every instance, the plaudit of &#x0022;well done, good and faithful servant.&#x0022; If we reflect a moment we will remember that the very needles of the housewives and the maidens have prepared clothing, whilst their looms have furnished the rough material.--Nor should we forget the diligent husbandmen who have labored to raise, subsistence for our armies.--In a war such as ours, every man has his part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>There are few idlers or drones.
