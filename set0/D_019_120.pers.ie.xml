<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The removal of the company to some point accessible to <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> had been procured by the inferior officers, with the hope that <persName n="Fisher,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="nearbymention:Fisher,C.,F.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Fisher</surname></persName> might be prevailed upon to return to his home in that city, it having become apparent, during the last few days, that, from aberration of mind, he had become unfit for his position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>He expressed himself highly gratified when the order was received, and gave orders to march immediately from the neighborhood of <placeName key="tgn,2265633" n="1.000 8" reg="craney island, portsmouth, virginia">Craney Island</placeName>, where his command had been posted.

<head>[for the <orgName n="Richmond Dispatch" type="newspaper">Richmond Dispatch</orgName>.]<lb/>to the <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italians</rs> of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>.<lb/><hi rend="smallcaps"><orgName n="University of Virginia" type="university">University of Virginia</orgName>,</hi> <date value="1861-05-11">May 11, 1861.</date></head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/> I read in the <hi rend="italics">Daily Dispatch,</hi> of the <date value="4">4th</date> instant, an article about the proposed formation of a Garibaldi Legion in New York, intended to fight against the rights and people of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>As the name of the legion is that of the modern <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italian</rs> hero, and I am a native <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italian</rs>, although now a naturalized <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> and a resident in the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName>, I feel the deepest interest for all that regards both my native and my adopted country; and I hope, therefore, that should the intention of forming such a legion be true, no <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italian</rs> may enlist under its banner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>The <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italians</rs> of this time are naturally bound to respect, and everywhere to sustain, the principle which <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName> has assumed in fighting the battles of her independence; the principle which, being now acknowledged by the civilized world in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, has led to the deliverance of that lately oppressed land; the principle that only despots and tyrants have dared to oppose; in short, the principle that every nation has a natural right of choosing her own government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>Would it not, then be proper for every <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italian</rs>, before undertaking to wage a war in favor of <num value="1">one</num> party and against another which neither does nor ever did intend to do him any harm, to examine what important or rightful motive leads him to that war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>Would it not be reasonable to consider which of the <num value="2">two</num> parties is wrong and which is right?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>And, finally, would it not be his duty to ascertain whether, by declaring against <num value="1">one</num> of the parties, he comes, unconscious to himself, to declare against that principle that has freed his own country from the most ignominious bondage? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/> <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName> has been for a long time under the rule of tyrants, who constantly refused to let her have any share in her own government; who have compelled her to blindly submit to their own authority, which alone they claimed to be the lawful <num value="1">one</num>; who treated as rebels any of their subjects who demanded a more just government; who treated as guilty of high treason those who dared to resist their tyranny, and who revenged with bomb and shell upon a whole nation, when she, tired of being oppressed, determined to overthrow the old, and to inaugurate a new Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>The names of those sovereigns will live eternally branded with the contempt of all future generations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/><persName><roleName n="King">King</roleName> <foreName>Bomba</foreName></persName>, and his worthy son and successor, <persName><roleName n="King">King</roleName> <foreName>Bombetta</foreName></persName>, will be transmitted to our most remote posterity as names of horror to mankind. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/> Why should, then, the <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italians</rs> enlist to fight against the <rs>South</rs>, as long as it has not declared war against any nation, or any party, and has only placed itself on the defensive?--The South has no wish to invade the territory of others; it only wishes to defend its own from the aggression of those who have left no exertion untried to deprive it of its vital institution, and of any share in the <rs>Government</rs>; of those who have not even scrupled to divert the ministers of the <name>Gospel</name> from their religious avocations, and from the standard of peace that <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00046" reg="mostcommon:Christ,nomatch:0"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>, whom they profess to worship, pointed out to them; of those who have called upon the same ministers to disfigure religion and to pollute it with the spirit of their own <orgName n="Political Party" type="party">political party</orgName>, and to train the minds of the present generation not against sin &mdash; for <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00047" reg="mostcommon:Christ,nomatch:0"><surname>Christ</surname></persName> never preached that slavery was a sin &mdash; but against an institution that they alone fanatically define as a sin. Has not this very war taken place for a long time between <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName> and her tyrants?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>Is not the principle on which <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName> has struggled entirely the same as that which the <rs>South</rs> has adopted in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>If so, why should we blame the <rs>South</rs> while we glory in the attitude of <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>?--and why should our sympathies be entirely with <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName> in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and against the <rs>South</rs> in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/> But the <rs>North</rs> accuses the <rs>South</rs> of having taken the forts that belonged to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>Here, however, we ought to consider that these forts originally belonged to the <rs>South</rs>, and that they were yielded to the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> while these <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> would exist, not only physically, but morally; while the <rs>Government</rs> would be not that of <num value="1">one</num> section, but of the whole Union; while the <name>States</name> would be equally respected as sovereigns, and treated with perfect impartiality according to the friendly spirit of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>But when a part of the <name>States</name>, carried away by an evident spirit of enmity against the other, should undertake to overpower it, and, by means of unjust exertions, should succeed in acquiring the <rs>Government</rs> and in imposing, therefore, its laws upon the other part, so that the latter, for its interest, for its institutions, for its existence, for the honor of its own people, is compelled to withdraw from the <rs>Union</rs>, shall it not then have a right to retake what was always its own?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>Should this right be denied, <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName> should have allowed her tyrants to retain her forts, and to go on with their system of oppression; but no <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italian</rs>, except traitors, would have left the forts in the power of the oppressors of his land. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/> Finally, the <rs>North</rs> maintains that the <name>States</name> had renounced the right ever to withdraw from the <rs>Union</rs>; but also the despots of <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName> said that their beloved subjects had no right to withdraw from the oppression of their kings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>We <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italians</rs> do not believe in that doctrine; the civilized world has discarded that maxim as a remnant of barbarism, and with that maxim <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName> could not now be what she is. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/> And now, my respected countrymen, do you think that <persName n="Garibaldi,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00048" reg="mostcommon:Garibaldi,nomatch:0"><surname>Garibaldi</surname></persName>, under the circumstances already stated, would employ his sword against the <rs>South</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>And if not, would he not consider the giving his name to the legion already mentioned as an insult to himself?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>But why do I proceed with my reasoning, when I know that no <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italian</rs>--no true <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italian</rs>--will enlist in that legion? </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>Every eye brightened, and every heart beat high with stern delight that the hour of vengeance is at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>If <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> can be overrun by a host of Northern militiamen, if <num value="1">one</num> man in defence of his fireside is not equal to <num value="2">two</num> invaders, then this onward movement of our detestable enemy is founded in wisdom.--But when that day comes, it will be a new day in the history of nations, and <num value="1">one</num> which will prove that we deserve to be conquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>They have spared no pains, says the <hi rend="italics">Mercury,</hi> to diminish the glory of the <rs>Charleston</rs> conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>They had opened their ears to the silliest stories of clodhoppers, and have also, themselves, in their rage and hatred, invented statements concerning that bombardment which so exceeded the bounds of probability that the slandered were reluctant to pronounce them false.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>Some were of opinion that they should not have believed the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> reports that reached them touching the strength of the coming army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>And many whose courage is of a rash, high kind, condemned the <rs>Captain</rs> for retreating in so great haste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>Had he not been so nervously eager to get beyond range of the hostile guns, he might have carried away much that would serve his cause in the course of the war, and at any rate he had ample time to inflict material injury and loss on the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>But the excited commandant already heard the tramp of the terrible legion at the gates, and giving the order to march, which was readily obeyed, the light-footed sons of war went at a trot toward <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>We only know that he left in a hurry, and that he and his command are now thirsting for the blood of the rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>But we were surprised beyond measure when we saw this hasty evacuation and rapid retreat proclaimed a victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>The warlike gazettes of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00076" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s</hi> realm in their accounts of that evacuation, claimed it as a victory over the <rs>Virginia</rs> troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>If they had praised the captain for vigilance, and quickness and speed, he would have richly deserved their most extravagant laudations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>Or they might have shown that he evinced the possession of the highest qualities of a great commander, by the consummate skill with which he conducted the retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/> --In connection with this subject the <rs>Montgomery</rs> correspondent of the <orgName n="Charleston Mercury" type="newspaper">Charleston Mercury</orgName> makes the following interesting statement: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/> New discoveries of saltpetre have been made in <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>, which bid fair to furnish a quantity of that article to more than supply all our wants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>It has been found in caves, in a crystalline form, and of fine quality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>A large quantity has been found near <placeName reg="Jacksonport, Jackson, Arkansas" key="tgn,2008579">Jacksonport, Jackson county</placeName>, and in <placeName reg="White, Tennessee, United States" key="tgn,2001929">White county</placeName>, within <num value="20">twenty</num> and <measure n="25miles" type="distance">twenty-five miles</measure> of navigable waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>The mines in <placeName reg="White, Tennessee, United States" key="tgn,2001929">White county</placeName> are now turning out from <num value="1000">one</num> to <measure n="2000l." type="pounds"><num value="2000">two thousand</num> pounds</measure> of nitre daily, and a contract has just been completed with the chief of the <orgName n="Ordnance Bureau" type="bureau">Ordnance Bureau</orgName>, to supply the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> with <measure n="1000l." type="pounds"><num value="1000">one thousand</num> pounds</measure> daily, to be delivered in <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>, and an additional quantity, if wanted, landed at other points.--Sulphur has also been found in quantities.--From a late survey we learn that saltpetre, sulphur, lead, coal and iron, are found in abundance in the <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">State of Arkansas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>The saltpetre is found in caves and in positions where the mines can be easily worked, so that it will be but a short time before it can be gotten into market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>Nitre, or saltpetre, is an important salt of potash that is found in great abundance throughout the world, wherever the mineral salts exists in any large quantities in the soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>The <placeName reg="Mammoth Cave, Edmonson, Kentucky" key="tgn,2489963">Mammoth Cave, Kentucky</placeName>, has furnished large quantities of it, and it can be found in any cavern in this country, in all soils that contain materials undergoing decay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>It is not found as mineral in the earth, nor is it manufactured except by the hand of Nature, wherever there is a heap of moist rubbish, with some base as potash or lime present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>It is found in all lime soils especially, but if exposed to the rains it is washed out and consumed by vegetation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>It is to be presumed that in limestone districts much nitre could be obtained by taking soil from under old negro houses, or heaps of decayed wood, and leaching it in hoppers, as is done in making lye, then boiling to dryness; but the recent discoveries in <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName> will prevent resorting to such labor for sometime to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>Should necessity require, a few simple directions scattered among farmers might afford the <rs>Government</rs> an abundance of this material.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>As is well known, this important substance is used principally in the manufacture of gunpowder, into which it enters in the proportion of <num value="75">seventy-five</num> parts in the <num value="100">hundred</num>, although this proportion varies a little in different countries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>I have been thus explicit in description of this matter, because it is now engaging considerable attention in scientific circles. </p> </q><bibl n="Montgomery correspondent of the Charleston Mercury"></bibl></cit> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
