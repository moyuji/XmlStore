<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/> I am not at all surprised at your being at a loss to know what your powers and duties are in your new position, and your inability to find anything in any written code of laws to enlighten you upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>The truth is, your office is unknown to the law. <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00117" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName> had no more authority for appointing you civil Governor of <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> than I had; and I had, or have, no more authority than any street, walker in your city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>Under his appointment, therefore, you can rightfully exercise no more power than if the appointment had been made by a street walker. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/> We live under a Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>That Constitution was made for war as well as peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>Under that constitution we have civil laws and military laws; laws for the civil authorities and laws for the military.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> age to be found in the <name>Statutes</name> at large, and the latter in the <name>Rules</name> and Articles of War. But in this country there is no such thing as martial law, and cannot be until the <rs>Constitution</rs> is set aside, if such an evil day shall ever come upon us. All law making power in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> Government is vested in Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>But Congress cannot declare martial law, which, in its proper sense, is nothing but an abrogation of all laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>If Congress cannot do it, much less can any officer of the <rs>Government</rs>, either civil or military, do it rightfully, from the highest to the lowest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>Congress may, in certain cases specified, suspend the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus,</hi> but this by no means interferes with the administration of justice so far as to deprive any party arrested of his right to a speedy and public trial by a jury, after indictment, &#x0026;c. It does not lessen or weaken the right of such party to redress for an illegal arrest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>It does not authorize arrests except upon oath or affirmation upon probable cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>It only secures the party beyond misadventure to appear in person to answer the charge and prevent any preliminary inquiry as to the formality or legality of his arrest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>It does not infringe or impair his other constitutional rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>These Congress cannot impair by law. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/> The constitutional guarantees are above and beyond the reach or power of Congress, and much more, if it could be, above and beyond the power of any officer of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>Your appointment, therefore, in my opinion, is simply a nullity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>You, by virtue of it, possess no rightful authority, and can exercise none.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>The order creating you civil Governor of <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> was a most palpable usurpation, I speak of the act only in a legal and constitutional sense; not of the motive that prompted it. But a wise people, jealous of their rights, would do well to remember, as Delorme so well expressed it, that <q>&#x0022;such acts so laudable when we only consider the motive of them, make a breach at which tyranny will <num value="1">one</num> day enter,&#x0022;</q> if quietly submitted to long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>Now, than, my opinion is, if any <num value="1">one</num> be brought before you for punishment for selling liquor to a soldier, or any other allegation, where there is no law against it, no law passed by the proper law-making power, either State or Confederate and where, as a matter of course, you have no legal or rightful authority to punish, either by fine, corporeally, &#x0026;c., you should simply make this response to the <num value="1">one</num> who brings him or her, as the case may be, that you have no jurisdiction of the matter complained of. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/> A <persName n="Queen,,British,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00118" reg="default:Queen,British,,,"><foreName>British</foreName> <surname>Queen</surname></persName> (<persName><foreName>Anne</foreName></persName>) was once urged by the <rs>Emperor</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName> to punish <num value="1">one</num> of her officers for what <name n="his Majesty" type="role">his Majesty</name> considered an act of indignity to his Ambassador to her Court, though the officer had violated no positive law. The <rs>Queen</rs>'s memorable reply was that <q>&#x0022;she could inflict no punishment upon any the meanest of her subjects, unless warranted by the law of the land.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/> This is an example you might well imitate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>For I take it for granted that no <num value="1">one</num> will pretend that any General in command of our armies could center upon you or anybody greater powers that the <rs>Ruling Sovereign</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> possesses in like cases under similar circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>The case referred to in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> gave rise to a change of the law. After that, an act was passed exempting foreign ministers from arrest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>So with us. If the proper discipline and good order of the army require that the sale of liquor to a soldier by a person not connected with the army should be prohibited, (which I do not mean to question in the slightest degree,) let the prohibition be declared by law, passed by Congress, with the pains and penalties for a violation of it, with the mode and manner of trying the offence plainly set forth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>Until this is done, no <num value="1">one</num> has any authority to punish in such cases; and any <num value="1">one</num> who undertakes to do it is a trespasser and a violator of the law. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/> Soldiers in the service, as well as the officers, are subject to the <name>Rules</name> and Articles of War, and if they commit any offence known to the military code there in prescribed, they are liable to be tried and punished according to the law made for their government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>If these Rules and Articles of War &mdash; or, in other words, it the military code for the government of the army is defective in any respect, it ought to be amended by Congress, There alone the power is vested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>Neither <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> nor their Provost Marshals have any power to make, alter, or modify laws either military or civil or establish any tribunal to punish what they may so declare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>All those matters belong to Congress; and I assure you, in my opinion, nothing is more essential to the maintenance and preservation of constitutional liberty than that the military be ever kept subordinate to the civil authorities. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/> You then have my views hastily but pointedly given. </p> <closer> <salute>Yours, most respectfully.</salute> <signed><persName n="Stephens,,Alexander,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00119" reg="default:Stephens,Alexander,H.,,"><foreName>Alexander</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName>  <surname>Stephens</surname></persName>.</signed> </closer> </div4> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>And even now it is put forth not as an end, but as the means to an end, and that end not the freedom of the slave, but the restoration of the <rs>Union</rs>, or, in other words, the restoration of Northern commerce and trade.
