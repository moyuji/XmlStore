<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>The company has, from what we learn, a bright prospect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>It has already <num value="1">one</num> fine ship ready completed and officered to sail out upon the seas in quest of game.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Another will follow as soon as possible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> In no way, as we have remarked before when alluding to this subject, can our people injure and annoy the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> so much as by obstructing their commerce upon the seas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>The capturing of their rich argosies is insupportably distressing to them; and the driving them measurably from the water, and compelling them to employ the vessels of foreign nations to convey their freights from port to port, while their own ships are rotting at their wharves, is hardly less so.--Therefore, this means of warring upon our ruthless enemy should be a favorite <num value="1">one</num> with us, and every effort should be made by our people to conduct it with energy and effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>In addition, however, to that motive of patriotism which should excite these efforts, there is the strong stimulant of pecuniary gain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>As a pecuniary enterprise, the adventure of the volunteer navy is likely to prove exceedingly profitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Of course, there is peril in it, but the chances are greatly in favor of it. It is not improbable that, after the closing of the books on the <dateStruct value="--16"><day reg="2">16th</day></dateStruct>, the stock will not be again sold as low as the par value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>With their fast vessels, competent officers, and brave crews, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> commerce will be soon laid under heavy tribute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>These vessels will do a better business than blockade runners, who, after escaping their own perils, can only bring into our ports what they have bought and paid for in gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>The volunteer navy supplies its treasury from the captures of the enemy's property, paying nothing for them. --It is not hard to see that this kind of transaction will soon reimburse the stockholders all their outlay, and rapidly pour in rich profits upon their investment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>The prospect is most inviting both to patriots and speculators.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>There are, indeed, perils for the enterprise, but they in no wise compare with the chances of success, which are every way bright and tempting. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/> This is truly and essentially a conservative work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>It is <num value="1">one</num> of the ablest political books of the times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>We are far from agreeing with the author in lot; still there is much in the book to which we most heartily subscribe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>We give the following extracts, which illustrate the character of the book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>In the beginning of his volume the author remarks: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/> I propose to appeal to the &#x0022;reason and reflection&#x0022; of my &#x0022;sagacious and practical&#x0022; fellow <sic>citiszens</sic> in a few earnest, but I hope calm and moderate observations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>Assuming that we propose to prosecute the war until the authority of the <rs>Union</rs> is completely re-established in all the territory over which it extended when the rebellion broke out, and that the fortune of arms and the course of political events have been such as to place such a consummation within our reach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>I will assign the reasons for <num value="2">two</num> conclusions to which I have arrived, and to which it is the object of this work to lead also the reader's mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>These are, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, that no calamity could befall the nation, not even disunion, which would compare in its disastrous consequences to a successful termination of the war, under such circumstances as to leave behind it a permanent feeling of hostility and hatred to the <rs>Government</rs> of the <rs>Union</rs> on the part of the people over whom our victorious arms will have extended our away; and secondly, that such a feeling will naturally and inevitably result from further persistence in many of the measures of civil and military policy which we have already adopted, and from adopting other measures having the same general tendency which are now urged upon us by several leading statesmen. </p> </q><bibl n="Montgomery H. Throop"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/> Speaking of the popular fallacy that the <rs>South</rs>, if conquered, would become &#x0022;loyal&#x0022; i. e., <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00058" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> abiding people, tamely submitting to all the act of their conquerors, the author says: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/> Those who fancy that the <rs>Southern</rs> people will be induced, through fear of consequences or from regard to their personal interests, to become at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> the peaceable, and in time the willing, subjects of a Government owing its origin to usurpation, and sustained in its earlier stages by military power, found their hopes upon wishes rather than the lessons of experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>There is no part of a statesman's art which demands such consummate tact and ability as to close a breach between governors and governed; it is the nature of such a breach to widen from day to day, even when it occurs between a people and their legitimate ruler; but when the latter is a usurper and a conqueror, the task becomes hopeless till time shall have supplied him with a new patent of sovereignty. </p> </q><bibl n="The author"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/> History affords no instance to my knowledge where any people have become willing and loyal subjects to a Government imposed upon them by conquest and sustaining itself by military force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>It will perhaps he said, in answer to this suggestion, that a conquered people were never required to submit to so mild a Government as that under which the <name>Southerners</name> will live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>But the intensity of the feeling of animosity which will exist between the rulers and a large number of the governed, and the probable character of the former, forbid us to entertain the expectation that the new Governments will pursue a career of mildness to wards the political and social enemies of those by whom they were administered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>The essence of military rule is despotism, and it knows but <num value="1">one</num> way to escape from the difficulties and embarrassments of administration; that is to remove all obstacles by force, and to compel obedience by terror.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>And after a career of repression has once been entered upon, it cannot be abandoned &mdash; the policy of the <rs>Government</rs> becomes fixed, and a change impossible. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/> Here, too, is a pertinent extract: </p> <cit><q rend="break">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>And its kindred question &mdash; will the freed negro work?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>Under any possible solution of those <num value="2">two</num> problems, as a mere matter of profit and loss, balancing the expense of forcibly retaining the <rs>South</rs> in the <rs>Union</rs> against the expansion of commerce the increase of revenues the military strength or any other elements of national greatness which we fancy will result to us from so doing &mdash; the speculation will be the most disastrous that any nation ever undertook. </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> </div3>

<head>Valuable Hints in battle.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/> The suggestions under this head, lately published in this journal from a Mississippi captain in the <orgName n="Army of Tennessee" type="army">Army of Tennessee</orgName>, are of the highest importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>He says that every man in the army should be directed by his company officer not to deliver his fire until within the enemy's range, and then to fire as if he were firing at a target.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>He feels sure that if the company officers will impress this upon their minds, and the value of coolness and collectedness, <num value="1">one</num> volley fire in this way would scatter any number the enemy can bring against us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/> Instead of this at present, the writer declares he has often seen &#x0022;company commanders charging around with their swords flourishing above their heads, crying out, give it to them, boys, give it to them,&#x0022; so excited themselves, and causing such excitement in others, &#x0022;that they would miss an elephant at <num value="10">ten</num> steps.&#x0022; He has seen &#x0022;whole regiments and brigades deliver their fire when he was sure they did not wound even a single man!-- Of course such firing emboldens the enemy, enable them to fire with more accuracy, and is not only a waste of powder, but of life, and often of the battle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/> There are no better marksmen in the world than the soldiers of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>They are accustomed to the use of the gun from their childhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>But of what avail is their peculiar excellence as shots if they are not trained to deliver their fire with the coolness and precision which will make it tell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>The <rs>Generals</rs> of the army should give heed to the suggestions of this <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> officer, and impress upon the commanders of every company the necessity of overcoming all excitement in themselves and their men, and of firing as if they were firing at a mark. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/> <num value="10000">Ten thousand</num> men firing in battle as Southern men are accustomed to firing at game, would be a match for <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> random shooters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>The enemy, however numerous, would be intimidated and appalled by the havoc that would be worked in their ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>Why should not <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> shots, well directed, wound and kill <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> men or at least half that number?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/><num value="0.5">A half</num> a dozen such shots would decide a battle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/> Of scarcely less importance is the other suggestion of the gallant <rs>Mississippian</rs>, that, after routing the enemy, soldiers, instead of seeking to secure the spoils of a few haversacks and greenbacks, should keep each and every man in his place, ready to follow up advantages and secure the fruits of victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>Failure to observe this obvious dictate of common sense and military duty has robbed us of the fruits of many a glorious triumph and indefinitely protracted the war. What can be gleaned from the wreck of a battle-field is a pitiful price for the expenditure of so much valuable blood, and the hazard of a country's independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>Let us hope that there will be no more indecisive battles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>Let our soldiers enable our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> to follow up their victories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/><persName><foreName>Joshua</foreName></persName> prayed that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> would stay the sun in Heaven to enable him to follow up his enemies, and although we cannot expect its light to be arrested, we may at least exert all the precaution and energies in human power to reap the results of our success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>Gaining a battle is but the means to the end, and that end is the destruction of the enemy's army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>Let that be the aim and object of the <rs>Confederate</rs> leaders and Confederate soldiers in every future battle of this war. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head>Roll of honor.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/> For the purpose of preserving the names of the soldiers of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> in this war, the <orgName n="Virginia Legislature" type="legislature">Legislature of Virginia</orgName> has made provision for obtaining and publishing a list of all the men, including officers, whom <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> has furnished to this great contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/><placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> has done the same, and the officer who shall be charged with the duty of carrying out the resolutions of the <orgName n="Virginia Legislature" type="legislature">Virginia Legislature</orgName> cannot do better than adopt the mode of performing the work which has been employed in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, whose Government has exhibited in this, as in all other matters, a rare combination of genuine patriotism and practical wisdom. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/> The privates of the army deserve more than any other men such a record, and every State of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> should take measures to obtain it. The name of each man should be given, his birth- place, county, the period of his service, and any other fact that may be of interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>It will be a source of just pride to the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>and to his posterity that his name is thus perpetuated by his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>It will be the very least reward that such services as those of the rank and file of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and their officers deserve.--The name and fame of their great <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, whilst appropriately referred to in the record, will go down upon history, but it is only in such a record as this that the names of individual privates can be preserved. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/> It is no exaggeration to say that the world has never seen an army, in ancient or modern times, whose rank and file was composed of such materials as the armies of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>They have entered and remain in the service from the purest and most single hearted patriotism; they have given up all the comforts of home and submitted to the most fearful privations without any hope of earthly distinction; they have borne the brunt of every battle, and, performing deeds of heroism which the world has never seen surpassed, have whitened with their bones and crimsoned with their blood every hill and valley of their native land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>The least honor we can bestow upon such men is the preservation of their names in a plain and substantial volume, <num value="1">one</num> copy of which should be placed in the hands of every soldier and officer's family, to bear down their glorious names to posterity. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="3"> 
<head>The &#x0022;Times&#x0022; on the war.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/> The <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> continues to publish those characteristic <name>English</name> articles, which pat both belligerents on the head, and encourage each to pitch into the other, until their mutual efforts have accomplished what the arms of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> was unable to achieve &mdash; the destruction of both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>This is all that the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> desires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>If any <num value="1">one</num> wise enough to discern any meaning in its graceful riding of both sides of the sapling, we should like to be enlightened on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>We see it stated by a contemporary that the foreign journals pay but little attention at present to the affairs of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>We wish they would bestow still less.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>If the <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> quarrels that at present divert their attention from <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> affairs shall bring home to their own doors some of the evils of war, it will be a just retribution for the deliberate malice with which, for their own selfish purposes, such journals as the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> are laboring to protract the war in <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
