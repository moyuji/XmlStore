<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>By these various means, she exploited us of the results of our labor, by exchanging a little of the products of her labor for a great deal of that of ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>We resembled negro slaves in this, that we did not enjoy all the proceeds of our labor.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/> We have already said that slavery to foreign capital was worse than slavery to domestic capital, because in the latter case the tax levied or exploitated by it from the laboring class was in great measure returned by its being spent at home, thereby giving profitable employment to labor and diversifying industrial pursuits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/> It is true, that both private and public charity are but a return to the poor of part of their earnings, for the laboring class in realit, creates all values, supports the poor, supports the <rs>Government</rs>, and creates the fund from which both public and private charity are dispensed. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>The cotton loan, in keeping capital at home, will tend far to keep the earnings of labor at home, and thus provide a fund to give employment and good wages to the laboring poor, and from which to distribute charitable relief to those who need and deserve it. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/> The Federal Government having been driven to every expedient for the purpose of raising the wind, it is amusing to see now its apologists and champions at the <rs>North</rs> cry up every new experiment, albeit from each hollow scheme, each lower deep, they sink into a <q>&#x0022;still lower deep&#x0022;</q> of pecuniary desperation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>The <q>&#x0022;new popular loan&#x0022;</q> is the latest wrinkle, on which the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> harps as follows: </p> <cit> <q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/> The <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> has already issued Treasury notes, without interest, of the denomination of <num value="5">five</num> and <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">ten dollars</measure>, to the amount of several <num value="1000000">millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>These notes are payable on demand at any of the <name>Sub</name>-Treasuries of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, are popularly known as <q> &#x0022;demand notes,&#x0022;</q> and are everywhere seized upon and used by the people with great avidity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>The act of Congress under which these notes are placed in circulation authorizes their issue to the amount of <num value="50000000">fifty millions</num> of dollars, and at the assembling of the next Congress this amount will probably be increased to <num value="100">one hundred</num> or <num value="150000000">one hundred and fifty millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>We shall thus inaugurate, and, in effect, shall really have &mdash; a <orgName n="National Bank" type="bank">National Bank</orgName>, established upon a basis universally popular and incontrovertibly sound, safe, and healthy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>That these notes are sufficiently secured, no <num value="1">one</num> can for a moment doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>The issues of our very best banks are now secured by the deposit of <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> stocks, and if these stocks are good securities, then the demand notes of the <rs>Government</rs> which issued these stocks are also good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>But about this there is no question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>The people must lose confidence in the <rs>Government</rs> notes; and of that loss of confidence there has thus far been not the slightest indication this side of the <rs>Atlantic</rs>, As far as security goes, therefore, these demand notes excel the issues of our very best banks, and completely out-rival the issues of any of our banking institutions whose circulation is guaranteed only by State stocks, or by investments in <rs n="real estate" type="product">real estate</rs>, or in the stocks of various railroad, mining or other corporations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>In a word, the country is responsible for the payment of its demand notes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/> Nor is the superiority of the <rs>Government</rs> demand notes over those of our banking institutions less apparent when we consider them as a circulating medium.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>The issues of our Northern banks amount altogether to about <num value="150000000">one hundred and fifty millions</num> of dollars.--Now, of this sum not more than <num value="25000000">twenty-five millions</num> are circulated at par, and the remainder of this large issue is subjected to a discount of from <num value="1">one</num> to <num value="0.1">ten per cent.</num> Besides this, bank notes which are perfectly good in <num value="1">one</num> State, are either largely discounted or are entirely valueless in another State; and thus we have the necessity of frequent exchanges, and of a great crowd of bill and exchange brokers, who reap fortunes from the evils of our banking system, as many worse people do from the evils of humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>A national uniform currency, like these demand notes, obviates all of these evils at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>The notes pass at par anywhere within the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and thus there is no necessity for discount or discounters, exchange or exchange brokers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>Indeed, when the system is fairly tested, we apprehend that there will be no difficulty in using these notes, instead of specie, for foreign payments. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/> The necessity of such a national currency is felt here, but it is still more evident in some of our Western States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7007251" n="1.000 4" reg="illinois">Illinois</placeName>, for example, the bank issues were very generally se- </p> <milestone unit="column" n="7"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/> cured by deposits of the <rs>State</rs> stocks of seceded States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>Those have of course depreciated largely, and are in some cases entirely worthless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>The consequence is that the banks of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> have been obliged to wind up their affairs and stop business, and the <rs>State</rs> is left almost without a currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/><placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> drafts, payable to order, have been circulating there for some time, and, instead of being presented to the <name>Treasury</name> for payment have passed from hand to hand as money, until their backs and faces are severed with endorsements, and they are almost equally valuable as drafts and as autographical collections. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/> The evils of this want of a recognized currency, of large discounts and of frequent exchanges, these Government demand notes remedy, and it is no wonder, therefore, that they have become so very popular, and are in such great demand that they may be called <q>&#x0022;demand notes&#x0022; </q> in a double sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>The full amount of <num value="50000000">fifty millions</num> should be issued as quickly as possible, and when Congress meets this amount should be largely increased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>Thus we shall have a <orgName n="National Bank" type="bank">National Bank</orgName> without the disadvantages and drawbacks of the old, unpopular system, and with all the advantages to the <rs>Government</rs> and to the people of a recognized, reliable, national paper currency. </p> </q> <bibl/> </cit> </div3> </div2> </div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>With regard to the <name>Presidential</name> election we have nothing to say, except that it is important for every man who has a vote to give it. The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, with <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00055" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName></hi> at their head, have been contending all along that the secession of the <rs>Southern States</rs> is a mere partizan movement on a small seale, gotten up by discontented politicians, and that the great body of the people not only do not sympathize with it, but are at heart bitterly opposed to it. This is or was <num value="1">one</num> of the pretexts alleged for invading the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>It was contended that a reign of terror existed here, and that the people voted under its influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>It was confidently stated that if freedom of choice were allowed, the large majority would be found opposed to secession, and the <rs>Federal</rs> army was designed to set opinion at liberty, and enable the friends of the <rs>Union</rs> to express their preference without the fear of bodily harm.--Even now the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> papers, in sketching their programmes for a winter campaign in the <rs>South</rs>, reckon largely upon the sympathy of vast bodies whom they suppose to be attached to the old system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>There never was a falser assumption, it is true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>But it has not been without its effect at the <rs>North</rs>, where men, if they could be convinced that the whole Southern country was arrayed in heart and soul against the restoration of the <rs>Union</rs>, would be apt to see the folly of waging a long and expensive war for so unattainable an object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>Let the vote be thin, and the people careless and willing to suffer the election to go by default, and they will still have ground for maintaining their present position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>Let the turn out be general, the movement enthusiastic, the vote large, and no ground will be left them to stand upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>We therefore hope that there will be no remissness in this respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>Let every man who can get to the polls deposit his vote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>Let none think that because there is no opposition, there is no danger, and therefore no occasion for exertion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>A large vote, we tell all persons disposed to indulge any chimerical notion to the contrary, is more important now than it ever was before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>We must show the world, who are watching us with the deepest interest &mdash; we must show our friends abroad, who are watching us with the deepest anxiety &mdash; we must show the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> and their Government, who are watching us with the deepest malignity &mdash; that we are a great, united people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>That the opposition among us is so small as scarcely to make up that sort of exception which is said to prove a general rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>That the whole Southern people are united in opposition to the old Government, and in favor of the new. That the crisis, in the midst of which we exist, is a mighty revolution, which it is wanton wickedness, in a supreme degree, to attempt to suppress by means of an armed force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>That it is the strongly expressed desire of a vast country to change its system of government, as every community under the sun has an undoubted right to do. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>It is this consideration which should forbid them to vote for any man who could be supposed capable, under any difficulties, under any danger, to consent to any treaty establishing that line as a boundary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>Let it be understood at once, through this election, that <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> never will lay down her arms as long as there is a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> soldier on her soil, or on the condition that <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> is to be the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> frontier. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>He was excessively fatigued and worn out, and unable to furnish any details of the remarkable combat he had planned and executed; but from a gentleman who was all through the fight, we obtained the following particulars: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/> The expedition started down the river from the forts at an early hour <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, the fire-boats ahead, and the gun-boats following.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>But the span of fire-boats could not be controlled by the tug that was attempting to guide it, and very soon it commenced to slew round, and then, despite every effort, it ran into the river bank. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/> The plan of firing the fleet was immediately abandoned by <persName n="Hollins,Commodore,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00237" reg="mostcommon:Hollins,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commodore">Commodore</roleName> <surname>Hollins</surname></persName> on the occurrence of this accident, and he proceeded down the river with the gun-boats, for the purpose of making a legitimate attack upon them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/> The vessels of the enemy found lying at the head of the passes were the <term type="ship">steam frigate</term> <rs type="ship">Richmond</rs>, the sailing <term type="ship">sloop-of-war</term> <rs type="ship">Vincennes</rs>, the sailing <term type="ship">sloop-of-war</term> <rs type="ship">Preble</rs>, and the steam <term type="ship">gun-boat</term> <rs type="ship">Water Witch</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/> They were taken completely by surprise and had not the steamers had steam up at the time, perhaps none of them would have escaped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>As it was, their firing, man&#x0153;uvres, and general conduct, showed that they were thunderstruck and frightened. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/> The <rs>Manassas</rs> led the way of our little fleet, and, steering straight for <num value="1">one</num> of the sloops-of- war, ran right into her. The force of the concussion was tremendous; so much so as to put the machinery of the <rs>Manassas</rs> out of gear, and render her perfectly useless, floating about in an unmanageable condition on the water. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/> But the enemy were very quick in making their arrangements to move, and the <num value="2">two</num> steamers each took <num value="1">one</num> of the sloops-of-war in tow, and started down the river, making the best speed of which they were capable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/> They defended their retreat with every gun they could bring to bear upon their pursuers, but their aim was wild and showed that the gunners were terribly alarmed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/> The <rs>McRae</rs>, Ivy, and <rs n="Tuscarora" type="nativeamerican">Tuscarora</rs> led our fleet, and were the boats that kept up the fire on the retreating vessels, and drove them down stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>The other vessels of our fleet followed on down as well as they could. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/> The enemy's vessels took the <placeName reg="Southwest, Westmoreland, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2093239">Southwest</placeName> Pass for their avenue of escape, but some of them got aground on the bar there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>The boats of our fleet then came up with them, about <time value="9am">9 o'clock A. M.</time>, and firing now commenced in earnest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>It being daylight, they discovered the weakness of our fleet, and they managed their guns in a far abler manner. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/> For over an hour the duel was kept up, but at the end of that time <persName n="Hollins,Commodore,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00238" reg="mostcommon:Hollins,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commodore">Commodore</roleName> <surname>Hollins</surname></persName> signalled our boats to withdraw from so unequal a contest, in which nothing more was to be gained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>At the time of leaving, they were taking the men off the sloop-of-war that had been run into by the <rs>Manassas</rs>, and she was settling in the water in a significant manner, so that there can be no doubt of her foundering and total loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>Our informant believes that this vessel was the <rs>Vincennes</rs>, and not the <rs>Preble</rs>, as was reported by <persName n="Hollins,Commodore,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00239" reg="mostcommon:Hollins,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commodore">Commodore</roleName> <surname>Hollins</surname></persName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/> Our little fleet returned up the river and captured the cutter of the steam <unclear>fri </unclear> <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, which was full of cutlasses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>What became of the men who had thrown down their cutlasses in such a hasty manner and abandoned their boat, is not known. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/> Returning to the head of the passes, a detachment of men were landed, who set fire to all the lumber which the enemy had put ashore there after bringing it such a distance and at such great cost, and it was totally consumed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>The <rs>Manassas</rs> was then taken in tow and all of the boats returned to the forts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/> Not <num value="1">one</num> of our boats are injured in the slightest manner, except the slight disarrangement of the machinery in the <rs>Manassas</rs>; but are quite ready to repeat the affair should the enemy give them a chance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>Not a single man on any of our boats was hurt in the least.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>It is believed that all of the enemy's vessels are somewhat injured, and that there must have been many casualties among their crews; but of this nothing can be known as yet. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/> The <hi rend="italics">Picayune,</hi> of <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, says in relation to the affair: </p> <cit> <q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/> This feat will rank with the most brilliant and daring achievements of the war. It was skillfully projected, and executed with an impetuous bravery which reflects new honors on the veteran sailor who was in command, and stamps the crews whom he led as men of the true metal when danger and duty call. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/> The result of this dashing expedition shows what sort of a reception the marauding expeditions which are setting out from the <rs>North</rs> are likely to meet, when the proper preparations are made for encountering them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>The advantages of flotillas, of gun-boats, and launches, issuing out of <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creeks</rs> and rivers, and supported by proper shore batteries, over any invading force afloat, are sufficiently demonstrable, and now sufficiently demonstrated, to show where our real defences lie, and to stimulate the authorities to place them everywhere where they may be needed to repel any serious attempt to penetrate into the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>Another such a reception, if Lincolnism is willing to encounter it again, would go far to extinguish finally the idea of attempting invasion from that quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>The blow which has so crippled their force at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> encounter should be our inspiriting caution to redouble the preparations for resistance to any possible accumulation of attacking force, and thus satisfy the enemy of the uselessness of prosecuting a hopeless design. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/> It is no <placeName reg="Fort Hatteras">Hatteras</placeName> affair, where a <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-General</rs>, at the head of a Federal army, and a Commodore of a large <orgName n="Federal Squadron" type="squadron">Federal squadron</orgName>, were feted about the <rs>Northern</rs> cities as famous conquerors, for having captured a petty sand-bank with half a regiment of men; but it was a naval fight in which superior forces were badly whipped, and the victors come to receive the plaudits of their fellow-citizens for the successful repulse of a powerful and insolent invader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>By sea and by land the good cause flourishes, under the smiles of a benign <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, by the strong arms and brave hearts of the soldiers and sailors of the <rs>South</rs>.
