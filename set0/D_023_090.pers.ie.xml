<head>The Northern <orgName n="Episcopal Convention" type="convention">Episcopal Convention</orgName>--report of the <rs>Committee</rs> of <num value="9">Nine</num>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>The following is the report of the <rs>Committee</rs> of <num value="9">Nine</num>, to whom were referred the several prepositions relating to the condition of the country: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>The committee have been deeply impressed with the importance and with the difficulty of the duty assigned to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>They have examined with care all the various resolutions which have been referred to them, and have not lost sight of the subsequent suggestions which have been made in debate by members of this body from many different parts of our country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/> In framing the resolutions which they have at length, after much deliberation, agreed upon, they have had <num value="3">three</num> leading objects in view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>They have designed to leave no room for honest doubt, or even for invidious misconstruction, as to the hearty loyalty of this body to the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>They have desired to confirm and strengthen the unity of the <rs type="place">Church</rs>, as represented in this Convention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>And they have attempted so to refer to the course of our brethren who are not represented here as to shut no door of reconciliation which is still open, and to afford the best hope that they may still be induced to reconsider and retrace their steps, and to renew their relations, in <name>Christian</name> love and loyalty, to a common Church and a common country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>The committee have felt that it was not fit for this Convention to act or to speak as if they despaired, or in any degree doubted, of the ultimate restoration of the legitimate National authority over our whole land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>They have felt, too, that the question before them was not so much as to what might be done, or what might be said, by this body, as a matter of stern justice, in vindication of the authority or the dignity of the <rs type="place">Church</rs>, but as to what it was wise to do or say at this moment, consistently with our own convictions, and with a view to preserve, unbroken and undisturbed, every remaining link or tie of religious association and <name>Christian</name> sympathy which might be of use hereafter in accomplishing the great end of restoring our <orgName n="National Union" type="newspaper">National Union</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>The committee are unwilling to conclude their report without <num value="1">one</num> other suggestion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>While there could have been no hesitation, under any circumstances, in expressing now and always our earnest and abiding loyalty and devotion to our country, its Constitution, and its laws, and to all its duly constituted authorities they have felt that there yet rested upon this Convention the most solemn obligation to abstain from entering upon any narrower questions, which peculiarly belong to the domain of secular polities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>Our blessed <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>, in declaring that His kingdom was not of this world, and in directing u &mdash; to render unto C&#x00E6;sar the things that are C&#x00E6;sar's, h &mdash; clearly taught us that, whether as ministers or as legislators and councillors of His Church, we are to refrain from those matters which He has not committed to our care. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>There is doubtless a difficulty in the minds of many in clearly discerning the precise boundary line between the subjects which come within our jurisdiction and the proper sphere of duty as <name>Christian</name> ministers and ecclesiastical counsellors, and such as belong exclusively to secular politics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>But the committee can hardly doubt that there will be a general concurrence in the opinion that, in this meet critical period in the history of our Church and of our country, when words are things, and when rash utterances at <num value="1">one</num> end of the <rs>Union</rs> may co-operate with rash acts at the other in extinguishing the best hopes which remain to us, it is wise for such a body as this to err on the safe side, if we must err at all; and to keep ourselves clearly within the limits which the councils of our Church have hitherto so uniformly observed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/> In accordance with these general views, the undersigned recommend the adoption of the following resolutions: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/> <hi rend="italics">Resolved.</hi> By the <rs type="place">House of Clerical</rs> and Lay Deputies of this stated Triennial Convention, that assembling, as we have been called to do, at a period of great national peril and deplorable civil convulsion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>it is meet and proper that we should call to mind, distinctly and publicly, that the <orgName n="Protestant Episcopal Church" type="church">Protestant Episcopal Church of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></orgName> hath ever held and taught, in the language of <num value="1">one</num> of its articles of religion, that <q>&#x0022;it is the duty of all men who are professors of the <name>Gospel</name> to pay respectful obedience to the civil authority, regularly and legitimately constituted,&#x0022;</q> and hath accordingly incorporated into its Liturgy <q>&#x0022;a prayer for the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and all in civil authority,&#x0022;</q> and <q>&#x0022;a prayer for the <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName>, to be used during their session;&#x0022;</q> and hath bound all orders of its ministry to the faithful and constant observance, in letter and in spirit, of these and all other parts of its prescribed ritual. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/> <hi rend="italics">Resolved,</hi> That we cannot be wholly blind to the course which has been pursued in their ecclesiastical as well as in their civil relations since this Convention last met, in perfect harmony and love, by great numbers of the ministers and members of this Church, within certain States of our Union, which have arrayed themselves in open and armed resistance to the regularly constituted Government of our country; and that while, in a spirit of <name>Christian</name> forbearance, we refrain from employing towards them any terms of condemnation or reproach, and would rather bow his humiliation before our common Father in Heaven for the sins which have brought His judgment on our land, we yet feel bound to declare our solemn sense of the deep and grievous wrong which they will have inflicted on the great <name>Christian</name> communion which this Convention represents, as well as on the country within which it has been so happily and harmoniously established, should they persevere in striving to rend asunder those civil and religious bonds which have so long held us together in peace, unity, and concord. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/> <hi rend="italics">Resolved.</hi> That while as individuals and as citizens, we acknowledge our whole duty in sustaining and defending our country in the great struggle in which it is engaged we are only at liberty, as Deputies of this Council of a Church, which hath ever renounced all political association and action, to pledge to the <rs>National Government</rs> &mdash; as we now do &mdash; the earnest and devout prayers of us all, that its efforts may be so guided by wisdom and replenished with strength, that they may be crowned with speedy and complete success to the glory of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and the restoration of our beloved Union. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/> <hi rend="italics">Resolved,</hi> That if, in the judgment of the <name>Bishops</name>, any other forms of occasional prayer than these already set forth shall seem desirable and appropriate &mdash; whether for our Convention, our Church, or our country, for our rulers or our defenders, or for the sick and wounded and dying of our army and navy and volunteers &mdash; we shall gladly receive them and fervently use them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/> <hi rend="italics">Resolved,</hi> That a certified copy of the foregoing report and resolutions be transmitted to the <rs type="place">House of Bishops</rs>, in evidence of the views and feelings of this body in reference to the afflicting condition of our Church and of our country. </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/> The last meeting of this assemblage, now holding the <unclear></unclear> session in New York, was in this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>Every <num value="1">one</num> remembers the interest it created, the beautiful autumnal weather, which was scarcely interrupted throughout the session &mdash; that <dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct> weather of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> which the late <persName n="James,,G.,P.,E.," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00228" reg="default:James,G.,P.,E.,"><foreName>G.</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>James</surname></persName> used to say was <q>&#x0022;fit for the <name>Gods</name>&#x0022;</q>--and the overflowing hospitality with which the capital of the Old Dominion surpassed, on that occasion, her <unclear> t</unclear> fame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>There was another circumstance which added new impressiveness to this august assemblage &mdash; its national character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>It was the last and only <unclear> stical</unclear> association, except the <rs n="Roman Catholic" type="religion">Roman Catholic</rs>, which had not been sundered by the sectional convulsions of the country.--It had proved itself a sheet anchor in the storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>There was not an Abolitionist among all its members; not a whisper of section was board in its debates, and its last act was the election of <num value="4">four</num> Bishops, afterwards consecrated in this city and all natives of the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/> It was during this suspicious session, when the horizon seemed bright and calm with benign and patriotic influences, that the bloody raid of <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00229" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName> in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> fell upon us like a thunderbolt from a clear sky. No <num value="1">one</num> in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> was more startled, amazed, and outraged, by that infernal deed than this Convention, whose members had been received here with such fraternal warmth and who had themselves been educated in a Church which was always the peculiar object of <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> animosity, from the time that <persName><foreName>Puritanism</foreName></persName> was born.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>Yet, that <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00230" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName> raid, which filled that Convention with such horror and indignation, was only the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gun of this accursed war &mdash; a war which, in its progress, has merged all sects and all churches in <num value="1">one</num> black crusade, until at last, <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> from the time the <orgName n="General Convention" type="misc">General Convention</orgName> assembled in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, we find the <rs n="Catholic" type="religion">Catholics</rs> and Episcopalians marching side by side with the fanatics of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, and probably contributing more than any <num value="2">two</num> other churches in the <rs>North</rs> to the strength of the <rs>Union</rs> cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>The same <orgName n="General Convention" type="misc">General Convention</orgName>, whose sessions here were so suspicious of good, meets again in New York, but it is the same only in name; nearly half the <name>States</name> are unrepresented, and lunatics start up in it to recommend the excommunication of the <rs>Bishop</rs> of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, whilst <persName n="Vinton,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00231" reg="mostcommon:Vinton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Vinton</surname></persName>, who seems likely to obtain more notoriety in the church militant than the church triumphant, reposes that the election of <persName n="Wilmer,Bishop,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00232" reg="mostcommon:Wilmer,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Bishop">Bishop</roleName> <surname>Wilmer</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, be pronounced uncanonical, schismatical, and Void.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/> It is a matter of surprise that the conservative element of Northern society, which have permitted themselves to be made the tools and instruments of Black Republicanism, do not see that they are themselves to be victims in their turn of the fanatical and agrarian party which they are helping to subjugate the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>But for <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, foreigners in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> would have long ago been deprived of all rights of citizenship, and the <rs n="Roman Catholic" type="religion">Roman Catholics</rs> become a proscribed people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>From the day of the battle of <placeName reg="Trafalgar, Ashley, Arkansas" key="tgn,2727325">Trafalgar</placeName>, <persName n="Bonaparte,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00237" reg="mostcommon:Bonaparte,nomatch:0"><surname>Bonaparte</surname></persName> began to build ships-of-the-line, and at the time of his fall he had already completed a large number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>They had not taken the sea, only because he found a difficulty in obtaining crews.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>The harbor of <placeName key="tgn,7008211" n="1.000 31" reg="cherbourg,manche,basse-normandie,france,europe">Cherbourg</placeName>, <num value="1">one</num> of the most extraordinary works in the world, begun by <persName><foreName>Louis</foreName> <genName n="14">XIV</genName></persName>., but neglected by his successors, was pushed forward during his reign with amazing energy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>Had that reign been protracted it would not have been left to be completed by Napoleon Ill.--He calculated upon having <num value="100">one hundred</num> ships-of-the-line riding at anchor in <placeName key="tgn,7008211" n="1.000 31" reg="cherbourg,manche,basse-normandie,france,europe">Cherbourg</placeName> within a given time, the building proceeding at the rate of a certain number every year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>He had selected crews from the conscription, and had made arrangements to exercise them in the best manner he could in the harbors, since they could not venture to sea. He reigned only <measure n="9years" type="date">nine years</measure> after the battle of <placeName reg="Trafalgar, Ashley, Arkansas" key="tgn,2727325">Trafalgar</placeName>, and the long time it took at that period to build a ship of-the-line, and the long time it took to form seamen for the old service, prevented him from perfecting and using his navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>But that he was bent upon it, and used the most powerful means to accomplish it, cannot be doubted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>He saw but too plainly that the freedom of the seas was essential to the prosperity of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, and that the conquest of the whole continent could not supply that <num value="1">one</num> want.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>He was a great and original genius, but it never entered his head that the best way to contend with a great naval power was to blow up all his ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>That idea is of later origin, and deserves all the credit for originality that can be claimed by the admirers of <persName n="Homer,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00238" reg="mostcommon:Homer,nomatch:0"><surname>Homer</surname></persName> and <persName n="Shakespeare,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00239" reg="mostcommon:Shakespeare,nomatch:0"><surname>Shakespeare</surname></persName> for the most original of their conceptions. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>The <rs n="Spartan" type="ethnic">Spartans</rs> never thought of destroying the ships of their allies in the <rs n="Peloponnesian" type="ethnic">Peloponnesian</rs> war because the <rs n="Athenian" type="ethnic">Athenian</rs> were the stronger at sea.
