<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>He is said to be a son of the illustrious statesman and financier whose name he bears, and who was <num value="1">one</num> of the purest and best of the <rs>Southern</rs> post revolutionary patriots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The son seems to be worthy of the sire, so far at least as ability is concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Nevertheless, we feel disposed to criticise some of his positions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>For instance, he says: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> &#x0022;The real danger to the country is, not so much from the <rs>Confederate</rs> issues, as the leal struggle or conflict that will arise between the <rs>Confederate</rs> currency and the <name>Sate</name> local currency as furnished by the banks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>If peace should be obtained upon its basis of our independence, then the <rs>Confederate</rs> currency will be too strong for the lead bank currency, and so many large capititists will be interested by purchase of bands and credits, that they will strengthen the <rs>Confederate</rs> currency, even to the overthrow of all local bank currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> great defraud will be for a Government Exchequer Bank, which will submit to no commission from all the local banks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>There will be a strong State necessity to submit to is order to prevent a greater national evil, which would be national bankruptcy, and the management of our vast debt and Government credits exclusively by a <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of Treasury</rs>, which would be too much power to place in the hands of any <num value="1">one</num> man, as its exercise would deeply affect the distribution of wealth in the <rs>Confederacy</rs> for generations to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>So, as a political financial necessity, a <orgName n="National Bank" type="bank">National Bank</orgName> in some form will come, and when it comes it will crush the <rs>State</rs> banks.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="Mr. Langdon Cheves,"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> Now, there is a law governing this matter of <num value="2">two</num> currencies circulating at the same time &mdash; so strong that it might almost pass for a law of Nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The more indifferent will always be sure to drive the better out of circulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The better will be hoarded or used in foreign trade, or deposited in the banks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Every man who has money to pay will pay it in the more indifferent currency, as almost everybody has had personal experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Unless, then, the <rs>Exchequer Bank</rs> in question, buy up the notes of the <rs>State</rs> banks for the express purpose of making a run upon them, or refuse to take them on any account, or use other means, direct or indirect, to impair their credit, we do not understand how they are to be overthrown. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> It seems to us that a Confederate Bank might be constructed, subject to none of the objections put forth by <persName n="Cheves,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="nearbymention:Cheves,Langdon,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Cheves</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>We are a Confederacy of States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Each <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> State is a nation within itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>We have formed a partnership for certain purposes, and each State has the right to leave that partnership when it finds that it is convenient or useful to do so. We have a general agent here in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, which we call the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>, and which manages the affairs of the firm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Now, why not take a hint from the structure of the system under which we live?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Surely a bank, to which every State contributed a portion of its general treasure proportionate to its representation in Congress, taking stock in the same proportion, would not be liable to the objections which can be alleged against an Exchequer Bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The States could, each, have its branch or branches, and be at perfect liberty to withdraw from the bank, as, they now are from the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>They could have a general agent at some <num value="1">one</num> point, as the <rs>Confederacy</rs> has now here in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The check upon this general agent would be too powerful to admit of the supposition that it would interfere with any State banks doing an hoariest and lawful business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The States would not suffer it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> No Confederate bank, we imagine, will ever be established without taking care to separate the functions of issue and discount.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>The immense benefit that has been experienced in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, from such a divorce, could not possibly be lost upon statesmen and financiers in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>A Confederate bank ought to be established, if established at all, principally with a view to regulate the currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>It ought, indeed, to be so constructed, as to possess the power to restrain the excessive issue of State banks, and to furnish a currency of universal credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>And therefore it ought to be under the complete control of some power or other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The ordinary business of banking ought to be a matter of very inferior consideration in the construction of such a bank, and should be placed under the strictest limitations. </p> </div3>
