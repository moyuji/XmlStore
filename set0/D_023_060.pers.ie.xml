<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>The important news we publish in another column, relative to the capture of <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName>, was not confirmed by anything received at the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> last night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>This, however, is not unusual, as news from the <name>West</name> and <name>South</name>west is frequently received by the press in advance of the <name>Department</name>.

<head>The <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> Since the passage of the <rs>Potomac</rs> by our forces, the difficulty of obtaining anything reliable of their movements has been greatly enhanced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>So far as car information extends, no <num value="1">one</num> has received any authentic accounts of the direction of our troops in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The programme marked out for them is doubtless known in official quarters, but even, this may be varied by the circumstances connected with and surrounding invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>It can scarcely be expected that their progress will be entirely unimpeded, whether they move in the direction of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, the <rs>Relay</rs>, or take a more northerly route and aim a blow at the capital of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> It was stated yesterday afternoon, but how correctly we leave the reader to judge, that our army reached <placeName reg="Frederick City, Maryland">Frederick City, Md.</placeName>, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Crossing as they did on <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>, there was nothing in the distance from the river to that point to prevent their reaching there at the time stated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The distance from <placeName key="tgn,7016855;tgn,2002161;tgn,2047202" n="0.145 000000.7272	placename;tgn,7016855;frederick, frederick, maryland,Frederick,Maryland,United States,North and Central America;0.145 000000.7272	placename;tgn,2002161;frederick, virginia, united states,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.073 000000.3636	placename;tgn,2047202;Fredericktown, Cecil, Maryland,Cecil,Maryland,United States,North and Central America" reg="frederick, frederick, maryland,Frederick,Maryland,United States,North and Central America;frederick, virginia, united states,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;Fredericktown, Cecil, Maryland,Cecil,Maryland,United States,North and Central America">Frederick</placeName> to the <rs>Relay</rs>, by the old <address><street n="National road">National road</street></address>, is about <measure n="40miles" type="distance">forty miles</measure>, and by the <orgName n="Baltimore and Ohio Railroad" type="railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</orgName> about <measure n="50miles" type="distance">fifty miles</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>From the several points where our army crossed the <rs>Potomac</rs>, via <placeName reg="Rockville, Montgomery, Maryland" key="tgn,7018805">Rockville</placeName> to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, the distance is less than <measure n="30miles" type="distance">thirty miles</measure>. From <placeName reg="Frederick City">Frederick City</placeName> to <placeName reg="Harrisburg, Dauphin, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7013694">Harrisburg</placeName>, via <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName> and <persName n="Carlisle,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Carlisle,nomatch:0"><surname>Carlisle</surname></persName>, the distance does not exceed <measure n="70miles" type="distance">seventy miles</measure>. So that, if they moved on <placeName reg="Frederick, Frederick, Maryland" key="tgn,7016855">Frederick</placeName>, and reached that city as stated, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, it is highly probable that they are already over the borders of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, and within easy distance of her capital. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>There was another report, however, that after crossing, our forces moved in the direction of the <rs>Relay</rs>, on the <orgName n="Baltimore and Ohio Railroad" type="railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</orgName>, <placeName><distance reg="9miles">nine miles</distance> <offset>west</offset> of  <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Coming to us as a rumor we give it for what it is worth, without pretending to decide upon its probability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Connected with this rumor was <num value="1">one</num> to the effect that there have been an uprising of the people of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> in resistance to the <rs>Federal</rs> authority, and that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">Provost Marshal</rs> of the city had been killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>We have all along believed that the people of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> would not quietly submit to Lincolnism <num value="1">one</num> day after the passing of the <rs>Potomac</rs> by our troops, and a confirmation of this rumor of an uprising would cause us no surprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The difficulty is said to have originated in an attempt of the <rs>Federal</rs> officials to remove the <rs type="place">Government stores</rs> from that city to the <rs>North</rs>, to which the people <hi rend="italics">en masse</hi> objected, and pitched in after the style of <date value="1861-04-19">the 19th of April, 1861,</date> with brickbats and other accessible weapons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>There was also a statement to the effect that an entire regiment of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> troops had joined our standard, renouncing their allegiance to the abolition government. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>And now, instead of trembling for our own firesides, we are filling the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> with alarm for the safety of their capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>The miserable remnant of that army which was to be the instrument of our subjugation, beaten, disheartened, baffled in its nefarious designs, is standing on the defensive, with a powerful enemy in its rear, and a force fully adequate to restrain its advance.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/> <q>&#x0022;<hi rend="italics">On this subject, after the most solicitous and matured consideration, I have not a shadow of doubt &mdash; I am perfectly clear and distinct in the opinion that this order of the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant-General</rs> is in direct and unmistakable conflict with the law of Congress, and also that there is no power, either in the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant-General</rs>, the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary at War</rs>, the <rs>President</rs>, or all combined, to interpolate any act of Congress, or to revoke, modify, or extend its provisions, in the absence of such power created and bestowed by the express provisions of the law itself, or a power derived from, and distinctly traceable to, an express grant of such power in the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>I have not been able to discover anywhere the grant of such a power, even by the most platitudinous implication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>I am, therefore, constrained to give it as my deliberate opinion, that the order in question cannot legally divest, impair, or curtail any <num value="1">one</num> right or privilege imparted to the certain designated persons in the <name>Conscript</name> act.</hi>&#x0022;</q> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/> <q>&#x0022;<hi rend="italics">The reason, spirit, and intention of the law in question, as well as its words, context, and subject matter, are plain and unmistakable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>There is no point, no word, no object, no purpose, which is not fairly and plainly set forth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>The question then presents itself, painful, serious and vital, shall the law prevail, or shall the intervening, unauthorized interpolation of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary at War</rs> prevail?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>If the committee dissent from the petition is it not due to the petitioners to report, and say wherein their petition is not allowable. </p>
