<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> The Confederacy is blessed with a great number of &#x0022;<persName n="Generals,,Street-Corner,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="default:Generals,Street-Corner,,,"><foreName>Street-Corner</foreName> <surname>Generals</surname></persName>.&#x0022; They plan a campaign with sagacity, elaborate the various combinations with care and patience, and conduct it invariably to a successful, and even brilliant, conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Their extensive military information, strong reasoning faculties, and decision and energy of tone and manner, never fail to cheer us with the hope that our country has yet in reserve an amount of military genius which, in the last extremity, will prove her salvation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> We never fail to derive information and advantage from the criticisms of these <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> in Reserve on the other <rs>Generals</rs> now in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>We always like to hear men talking on any subject which their previous education has not prepared them to comprehend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>It shows original genius and vigor of understanding to grasp and master in an instant sciences which other men have only been able to subjugate by long years of study.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Even <persName n="Bonaparte,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Bonaparte,nomatch:0"><surname>Bonaparte</surname></persName> did not disdain to develop and make efficient his natural genius for war by a thorough course of training at the military schools of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>We have reason to be proud of citizens who, with no such preparation, intuitively seize all the strong points of military science, and can tell us off-hand how a battle ought to be fought, a town defended, a fortress besieged, or a campaign conducted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>If the cause is lost, it will be because the counsels of these wonderful strategists are not regarded, and <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> fails to commence a correspondence with them and ascertain their views. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> The criticisms, at the street corners, of the various military leaders are highly instructive and edifying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> and <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Johnson,nomatch:0"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName> are not aware of that skillful and thorough analysis of their respective and relative claims to popular favor which may be any day heard at the lamp posts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>A Directory, self-constituted it is true, but none the less modest and intelligent on that account, holds its daily sessions at the street corners of the <rs>Capital</rs>, and settles the merit and the fate of every General of the <rs>Republic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The Directory at <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> used to take off the heads of unsuccessful officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The Directory at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> simply takes off their reputation, passes a vote of want of confidence, and gracefully adjourns to dinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>This is humane and generous, but significant and important.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Every military leader of delicate susceptibilities, who is subjected to censure from such a source, must feel like throwing up &mdash; his commission. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> We long for the time when the merits of the <rs type="place">Street</rs>-Corner <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> will be properly appreciated by their Government, and our armies be placed under their direct supervision and control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>We have had too much of <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> in this war. It is high time that the volunteer genius of the country should burst the cords that hold it to the earth, and, with <num value="3">three</num> armies and a hopeful nation on its back, soar aloft. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> The &#x0022;Rigid Neutrality&#x0022; of the <rs>British Government</rs> in this war is <num value="1">one</num> of the phrases which will live in history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>It means, practically, omitting no opportunity to assist each party to horn the other. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> In the memorable combat of <persName n="Jones,,Paul,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="default:Jones,Paul,,,"><foreName>Paul</foreName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName> between the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> <term type="ship">frigate</term> <rs type="ship">Bonhomme Richard</rs> and the <name n="United Kingdom">British</name> <term type="ship">frigate</term> <rs type="ship">Serapis</rs>, there was an illustration of &#x0022;rigid neutrality&#x0022; not often witnessed in naval actions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The reports of that desperate fight, subsequently given by both the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> and <name>British</name> commanders, complain bitterly of the damage <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> each suffered from the <term type="ship">frigate</term> <rs type="ship">Alliance</rs>, commanded by a <rs n="Frenchman" type="propernoun">Frenchman</rs>, <persName n="Landais,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Landais,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Landais</surname></persName>, who professed to be serving under the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/><persName n="Jones,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="nearbymention:Jones,Paul,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName> states in his report that, at a most critical period of the action, when both ships were on fire, his own said to be sinking, and nearly <num value="500">five hundred</num> <name>English</name> prisoners aboard let loose, the <rs>Alliance</rs> appeared, and he now thought the battle at an end, but to his utter astonishment the <rs>Alliance</rs> discharged a broadside full into the stern of the <rs>Bonhomme Richard</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/><persName n="Jones,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="nearbymention:Jones,Paul,,,"><surname>Jones</surname></persName> called to him, for Heaven's sake, to forbear firing into that frigate; yet he passed along the off side of the ship and continued blazing away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>There was no possibility, says <persName n="Jones,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="nearbymention:Jones,Paul,,,"><surname>Jones</surname></persName>, of his mistaking the enemy's ship for the <rs>Richard</rs>, there being the most essential difference in their appearance and construction; besides, it was then full moonlight, and, for greater security, <persName n="Jones,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="nearbymention:Jones,Paul,,,"><surname>Jones</surname></persName> had showed the signal of his reconnaissance by putting out <num value="3">three</num> lanterns--<num value="1">one</num> at the bow, another at the quarter, and the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> in the middle, in a horizontal line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Every tongue cried that he was firing at the wrong ship; but nothing availed, he passed round, firing into the <rs>Richard</rs>, head, stern and broadside, killing several of the best men, and delivering various shots under water, with the view of sinking the vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>All <placeName><persName n="Jones,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="nearbymention:Jones,Paul,,,"><surname>Jones</surname></persName>'s office</placeName>rs concur with their commander in his statement of the conduct of the <rs>Alliance</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>If now we turn to the report of the <rs>British</rs> commander (<persName n="Person,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Person,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Person</surname></persName>) of the <rs>Serapis</rs>, we find him stating that he fought <persName n="Jones,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="nearbymention:Jones,Paul,,,"><surname>Jones</surname></persName>, with the muzzles of the guns in the <num value="2">two</num> ships touching each other, from <time value="8:30">half-past 8</time> till <time value="10:30">half-past 10</time> P.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> The &#x0022;rigid neutrality&#x0022; of the <rs>British Government</rs> is of a piece with the naval tactics of <persName n="Landais,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Landais,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Landais</surname></persName>. <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> it assists <num value="1">one</num> belligerent, then the other; pours a broadside into the <rs>Confederates</rs>, and then rakes the <rs>Federal</rs>; the object being the same: to disable both, and to build up its own fortunes on their common ruin. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="3">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> In the eloquent speeches at the great meeting at the <orgName n="African Church" type="church">African Church</orgName>, the distinguished gentlemen present spoke with emphasis of the wonderful revival of patriotic spirit which had followed the humiliating demands of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> at <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Evidences of this change are multiplying every day. Men who had begun to talk in no under-tone of reconstruction now frankly acknowledge their folly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>If the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> really desired the consolidation of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and the indefinite prolongation of the war, he could not have adopted more effectual means than his answer to the <orgName n="Peace Commission" type="commission">peace commission</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> It is stated that quite a number of youths, from the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, who were pursuing their studies in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, have unexpectedly returned to their native land, and given as a reason for the abrupt termination of their scholastic engagements, the constant jeers and ridicule of their <name>British</name> schoolfellows, who were eternally taunting them for their absence from home while their country was engaged in a struggle of life and death. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> It is impossible to rebuke with severity the inconsiderate conduct of these <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> young gentlemen, who were, no doubt, sent to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> without consulting their wishes; perhaps, in many cases, against their own inclinations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Under the circumstances, their parents ought not to punish them with too much severity, nor send them back to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> by the next packet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Youth is the season of rash, generous and disinterested impulses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>A boy always has his head full of fighting and fair play, and it is more than you can expect of juvenile human nature to keep its eyes on a book and be amusing itself with dead languages when it sees its own house set on fire and the red blood of its own brothers and sisters staining the threshold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/><persName n="Smith,,Sidney,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="default:Smith,Sidney,,,"><foreName>Sidney</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName> once declared that boys ought to be put under a barrel and kept there from <num value="14">fourteen</num> to <num value="21">twenty-one</num>, as the only mode of keeping them out of mischief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>We certainly cannot expect boys to act like men. Besides, the army is, after all, a very good school for Confederate boys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>They can learn there what will be more useful to them hereafter, and to mankind, than all they can acquire at the best classical schools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>There is no teacher of grammar in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> who can convey to them, for example, the meaning of a verb &mdash; to be, to do, to suffer,--as they will learn it in the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>If they want <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName>, they will find a living <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName> in the <name>Thermopyl</name>&#x00E6; of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>; or Latin, there is <persName n="Lee,,Robert,E.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="default:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><foreName>Robert</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, the best <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> of the day, at the head of the <rs type="place">Southside University</rs>, with a good many <num value="1000">thousand</num> promising boys under his charge, who do the <rs>Latin</rs> exercises in a style that the world has never seen since the days of C&#x00E6;sar. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/> We gave yesterday the correspondence between <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00164" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> and <persName n="Seddon,ex-Secretary,James,A.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00165" reg="default:Seddon,James,A.,,"><roleName n="ex-Secretary">ex-Secretary</roleName> <foreName>James</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Seddon</surname></persName> with reference to the resignation of the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>To-day we give a card, put forth by the <rs>Virginia</rs> delegation in Congress, about the same matter: </p> 
<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head>To the public:</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/> It is with profound regret that the members of the delegation in Congress from the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName> find themselves obliged to make a public statement respecting their proceedings on a late occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>But the reflections upon their conduct, conveyed in a correspondence between His <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs> the <rs>President</rs> and <persName n="Seddon,the Honorable,James,A.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00166" reg="default:Seddon,James,A.,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">the Hon.</roleName> <foreName>James</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Seddon</surname></persName>, late <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, and the publication of that correspondence, render the statement necessary. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/> At the beginning of the present year, the <rs>Confederacy</rs> was thought by many to be in extraordinary danger in consequence of a series of misfortunes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>The public spirit was depressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>Apprehensions for the public safety were increased by a belief that our misfortunes were partly the result of mal-administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>Prompt, energetic and judicious measures appeared to be necessary for the restoration of the public confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>After mature consideration and consultation with others, the members of this delegation concluded that, among the most important of such measures, would be a general reconstruction of the <rs>Cabinet</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/> A meeting of the delegation was held about the middle of <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>, in which certain public affairs, peculiarly affecting the safety of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, were considered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>In the same meeting, after a frank interchange of views, it was resolved that the opinion of the delegation respecting a change of the <rs>Cabinet</rs> should be made known to the <rs>President</rs> as the advice of friends. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/> A member (the <rs>Speaker</rs> of the <rs type="place">House</rs>) was deputed to communicate the advice in the most friendly, respectful and confidential manner to the <rs>President</rs>, with suitable explanations of the motives and views of the delegation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>He was authorized to communicate also with any of the heads of departments; but otherwise the proceedings were to be regarded as confidential.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>The communication was accordingly made to the <rs>President</rs>, in person and by letter, and he received it, as we supposed, in the same spirit of patriotism, candor and friendship which had prompted the action of the delegation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/> The advice thus tendered by the delegation was, that a general reconstruction of the <rs>Cabinet</rs> was demanded by public sentiment, and was necessary for the restoration of public confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>It was given as an opinion of a delegation friendly to the <name>Administration</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>The decision of the matter was, of course, left to the <rs>President</rs>, with whom it constitutionally rested. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/> When the <rs>President</rs> had previously invited this delegation to consult with him, we received with satisfaction his advice respecting legislative business, and we had no reason to suppose that, whenever we should deem it our duty to offer him counsel respecting important affairs in the <orgName n="Department of the Executive" type="government">executive department</orgName>, our advice would be resented as officious. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/> If we had intended to embarrass the <rs>President</rs> or the heads of departments by an appearance of constraint, we might have invited members of other delegations, known to concur with us in opinion respecting the <rs>Cabinet</rs>, to unite with us in action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>We preferred to avoid such an appearance even at the hazard of rendering our advice less influential and of subjecting ourselves to misconstruction. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/> It can scarcely be necessary to state that the members of this delegation did not assume for themselves, or for the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>, or for Congress, a power to compel the resignation of heads of departments by any expression of opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>They had reason to expect that some movement would be made in Congress which might bring on a collision between the legislative and executive departments, or constrain the <rs>Executive</rs> to make concessions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>We desired to prevent such a movement, when we advised the <rs>President</rs> to conform the composition of his Cabinet to the prevailing sentiment in Congress and the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>We confidently hoped that such a change would, by its effects upon Congress as well as the <orgName n="Department of the Executive" type="government">executive department</orgName>, make the action of the <rs>Government</rs>, at a critical period, more efficient for the public safety. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/> The delegation, in advising the <rs>President</rs>, did not discriminate among the heads of departments, whatever were our individual judgments of particular officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>This course appeared to be the best suited to all the circumstances, and, especially, to the state of public sentiment, if not required by a sound political principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>We chose to regard the <rs>Cabinet</rs> as a body of counsellors, held responsible, as a whole, to public opinion for the general course of the entire administration, besides having each a separate responsibility as head of his own department.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>Whatever may be the theory of our Government, it had not occurred to us before the publication of the correspondence now under consideration that, practically, a body so eminent in our political system could, through dependence on the pleasure of the <rs>President</rs>, become so insignificant that a change of the heads of departments could not alter the administrative policy of the <rs>Government</rs> in any degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>It could not be presumed that a body of statesmen in our country, filling those high places, would contribute <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> no independent advice, information or influence to the policy of the <name>Administration</name>, or that they would long continue to hold office either in complete subserviency to a single mind or in defiance of the general sense of their countrymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>Of course we were aware that the <rs>President</rs> has power to dismiss them &mdash; a power fit to be exercised for the public welfare in a great crisis &mdash; and that to him belongs a controlling authority and the chief honor, as well as responsibility, of the <name>Administration</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>We did not design either to abate the constitutional authority of the <rs type="place">Presidential office</rs> or to take from our country the guiding influence of a President in whom we greatly confide, and whom we have firmly supported. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/> It is obvious that the general advice suggested by this delegation to the <rs>President</rs>, based on a general reason, alleging no fault and arraigning no individual &mdash; mere advice, to be adopted, applied or rejected by the <rs>President</rs> &mdash; might have been substantially accepted without excluding every particular head of a department from a new arrangement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>We expected and desired that at least <num value="1">one</num> exception would be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>It would not have been proper for this delegation to indicate to the <rs>President</rs>, when they volunteered counsel, the details of such arrangement; and, least of all, would it have been proper for us, as a delegation, to single out a secretary from our own State for partial action, highly as we esteemed the <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginian</rs> then in office and as much as we desired our State to be represented in the <rs>Cabinet</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>Misconceiving the spirit of our proceeding, our distinguished fellow-citizen, <persName n="Seddon,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00167" reg="nearbymention:Seddon,James,A.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seddon</surname></persName>, without a general reconstruction of the <rs>Cabinet</rs>, resigned the <orgName>office of <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>If we have unintentionally wounded his sensibilities, we deeply regret that such a consequence resulted from our action or from his construction of it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/> In a letter accepting his resignation, the <rs>President</rs> declined to approve the propriety of his decision to resign <hi rend="italics">because,</hi> he adds, &#x0022;I cannot admit the existence of a power, or right, in the legislative department of the <rs>Government</rs>, or in any part or branch of it, to control the continuance in office of those &#x0027;principal officers in each of the executive departments&#x0027; whose choice the <rs>Constitution</rs> has vested in the <rs type="role" reg="Chief Magistrate">Chief Magistrate</rs>,&#x0022; etc. He observes that the circumstances which gave rise to <persName n="Seddon,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00168" reg="nearbymention:Seddon,James,A.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seddon</surname></persName>'s resignation are without precedent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>In conceding a just and legitimate influence to enlightened public opinion, he denies &#x0022;that the declaration of a State delegation, or even of <num value="1">one</num> or both Houses, is entitled to be considered as the authentic expression of such opinion, or as requiring concessions from a co-ordinate department of the <rs>Government</rs>.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/> The public can now judge how far the discussion of such topics was relevant to our action, and how justly or wisely the publication of such a correspondence, or the spirit which pervades it, responds to the proceedings and purposes of this delegation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>That the friendly advice of a delegation, or the more authentic counsel of Congress, should be repelled in such a manner, with such claims, and at such a time, is a circumstance which we deplore for the sake of our country, and, let us add, for the sake of the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>It will not provoke us to a resentful controversy.--It cannot abate our devotion to the public cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>It does not alter our principles of action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>But since, by the publication of this correspondence, members of the <rs>Cabinet</rs> have (probably with their consent) been placed before the tribunal of public opinion at issue with the <rs>Virginia</rs> delegation upon the question whether they should have remained, or been retained, in office, notwithstanding the condition of our country and all the indications of public sentiment, this delegation does not recoil from that issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>Let it be decided by the country, to which we are responsible, and to which high executive officers ought to acknowledge their responsibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>Whatever else ensues, may our country be saved. </p> <closer> By order of <signed>the delegation.</signed> <lb/> <signed><persName n="Bocock,,Thomas,S.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00169" reg="default:Bocock,Thomas,S.,,"><foreName n="Thomas">Thos.</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName>  <surname>Bocock</surname></persName>, <persName n="Chairman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00170" reg="mostcommon:Chairman,nomatch:0"><surname>Chairman</surname></persName>.</signed> <lb/> <date value="1865-02-11">February 11, 1865.</date> </closer> </div4> </div3> </div2> </div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>While he was confident that no grand jury could bring in a true bill against the accused, yet it would be a usurpation of his privilege to discharge her, and he was, therefore, compelled to send her on for examination.
