<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The usual quiet prevailed on the lines below <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The day was beautiful, being the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of the hazy season known as the <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> summer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Where all was so quiet and, apparently, peaceful, it had been difficult, except for the endless lines of fresh entrenchments and the distant roar of our cannon shelling <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> Gap, to realize that we were in a state of war and that a huge hostile army was encamped not <measure n="10miles" type="distance">ten miles</measure> from the centre of the city of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> Though noiseless, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are not idle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>They are still working like beavers in and around <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Fort Harrison</placeName> and on their lines extending thence south to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName> and north towards the <placeName reg="Charles City, Charles City, Virginia" key="tgn,2111055">Charles City</placeName> road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>They are at <num value="1">one</num> point also engaged in some work of importance, the character of which is not yet developed. </p>

Behind this wood the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, in large numbers, have been busy for several days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>In the absence of all positive information on the subject, it is believed they are planting in this place heavy <orgName n="Mortar Battery" type="battery">mortar batteries</orgName> to shell our lines when their other arrangements shall have been completed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>If they are planting batteries here they will no doubt surround them with strong earthworks. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The general impression that there is any considerable amount of conversation going on between the hostile pickets on this line is entirely erroneous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The picket posts are from <num value="75">seventy-five</num> to <measure n="150yards" type="distance">one hundred and fifty yards</measure> apart, and there is no communication between them except on rare occasions, when there is a call from <num value="1">one</num> side or the other to make an inquiry into the cause of some commotion; but more frequently taunts and jeers are interchanged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>On a part of the line west of the <rs type="place">Osborne turnpike</rs> the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> of nights make night hideous by every variety of noise; yelling, crowing like cocks, braying like jackasses, and imitating a number of other animals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>To these cries, which are uttered in defiance, our men reply in kind and in the same spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The cutting through the neck of land known as <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> gap is of itself a big job; but this done, but half of the work towards making the canal is, if we are correctly informed, accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>It is said the channel of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName> where it passes the gap runs near the southern shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>At <time value="4oclock">four o'clock</time> in the afternoon the enemy made a stand and hostilities ceased for about an hour., The enemy then made a sudden attack, which, being unlooked for by our troops, (many of whom had by this time began to straggle,) was successful, and a retreat was ordered. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> This attack of the enemy is now supposed to have been made only to cover a further retreat, as the main body of the <rs>Federal</rs> army did not follow, and had we resisted with half the usual determination the result would have been different.

Of course, the <rs type="place">Valley</rs> is now conquered, as it has been so often before, and <orgName n="army"><persName n="Early,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00219" reg="nearbymention:Early,Jubal,,,"><surname>Early</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, for the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> or <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> time, destroyed or dispersed never to rally again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>This statement, in the usual inflated style of that vain-glorious and self-seeking officer, will no doubt have its effect at the <rs>North</rs> in making him the hero of an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>For that people, above all others that ever existed, delight in deceiving themselves and persuading themselves that they are near the completion of the tremendous task which they have undertaken to perform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>Hence the cry repeated for <measure n="3.5years" type="date">three years and a half</measure> that the rebellion is on its last legs, that the <rs>Confederacy</rs> is on the point of starvation, that the rebel army is reduced to a few skeletons of regiments, that the whole country is full of loyal <rs n="Unionist" type="political">Unionists</rs> that are eager to take up arms in support of the best Government under the sun. <measure n="3.5years" type="date">Three years and a half</measure> ago. <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00220" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> began to draw his bills of <num value="30">thirty</num> and <measure n="60days" type="date">sixty days</measure>, and notwithstanding they have been continually protested as fast as the appointed day has arrived, they are still believed in by the whole population of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>When <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00221" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> was making his campaign against <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> public was fed with the most extravagant lies, all of which they received as gospel, and all of which were to the same tune of taking <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and crushing the rebellion in <measure n="90days" type="date">ninety days</measure>. In all Yankeedom there were probably not a dozen persons who did not believe, last <dateStruct value="-04-"><month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>, that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00222" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> would take <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and crush the rebellion before the <date value="06-01">first of June.</date> When deferred hope had sickened the heart, and even some <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had begun to think that, after all, the job of crushing the rebellion might not be accomplished, hope revived with the trivial success of <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00223" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>.

The <rs type="place">Valley</rs> was conquered, <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName> was to fall, <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName> was to be taken, <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00226" reg="nearbymention:Sheridan,P.,H.,,"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> was to co-operate with <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00227" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> was to surrender with <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00228" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s whole army, and then the rebellion, so often overthrown, and so often rising, like the giant Ant&#x00E6;us, stronger from its contact with the earth, was to be held aloft and stilted in the arms of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <persName n="Hercules,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00229" reg="mostcommon:Hercules,nomatch:0"><surname>Hercules</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>It turned out that the <rs type="place">Valley</rs> was not conquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>Early recovered and <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00230" reg="nearbymention:Sheridan,P.,H.,,"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> was pressed back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>Now, however, it is certainly conquered, and Yankeedom is justified in once more going mad with joy. We are under the impression that their joy is as much out of place now as it has been on so many different occasions before. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/> For what was this victory, over which such a cry is raised?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>It appears that <persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00231" reg="nearbymention:Early,Jubal,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName>, on a certain day last week, attacked <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 2">two corps</orgName> of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00232" reg="nearbymention:Sheridan,P.,H.,,"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, routed them utterly, took their camp, their baggage, their wagons, and all their artillery, and pursued them <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure>. That in the course of the pursuit he captured and sent to the rear <measure n="1900" type="prisoners">nineteen hundred prisoners</measure>, <num value="1500">fifteen hundred</num> of whom have already arrived here, while <num value="500">five hundred</num> more are expected to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>That his troops either dispersed to plunder the camp of the enemy, and were attacked while in this condition, or came suddenly, and while they were exhausted from the battle and the pursuit, upon a heavy force of the enemy, strongly entrenched, with formidable batteries of artillery (for both these stories are told).--That they were compelled to fall back in great disorder, and lost all the captured cannon and <num value="12">twelve</num> pieces of their own in the streets of <placeName reg="Strasburg, Shenandoah, Virginia" key="tgn,7014550">Strasburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>That the whole loss in men was but <num value="1100">eleven hundred</num>, killed, wounded and missing; for, from all we can learn, the statement of <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00233" reg="nearbymention:Sheridan,P.,H.,,"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> that he had <measure n="1600" type="prisoners">sixteen hundred prisoners</measure> is utterly false.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>In the meantime, <persName n="Early,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00234" reg="nearbymention:Early,Jubal,,,"><surname>Early</surname></persName> has so far recovered that he has secured his prisoners and sent them safely here; and <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00235" reg="nearbymention:Sheridan,P.,H.,,"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> has so little recovered, that after losing, according to <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> accounts, <num value="5000">five thousand</num> men, killed, wounded and missing, he did not dare to pursue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>Early has given no intimation that he means to relinquish his hold upon the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>; and <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00236" reg="nearbymention:Sheridan,P.,H.,,"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> has the whole thing to try over again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>We think, when all these things shall have been duly considered, it will appear plain that the crushing of <persName n="Early,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00237" reg="nearbymention:Early,Jubal,,,"><surname>Early</surname></persName> and the possession of the <rs type="place">Valley</rs> are things which are yet to be accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>It is remarkable that <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00238" reg="nearbymention:Sheridan,P.,H.,,"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> tells the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> that it is <persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00239" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>, not <persName n="Early,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00240" reg="nearbymention:Early,Jubal,,,"><surname>Early</surname></persName>, whom he has just crushed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>He had told them before that he had annihilated <persName n="Early,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00241" reg="nearbymention:Early,Jubal,,,"><surname>Early</surname></persName>, and they firmly believed that not a man of his command was left, save as a captive or a deserter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>It was necessary to account for the strong force still in the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>, and he told them it was <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00242" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>Vanity is the meanest of all the passions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>It made <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00243" reg="nearbymention:Sheridan,P.,H.,,"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName>, in this instance, guilty of <num value="2">two</num> willful falsehoods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/><persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00244" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName> is not in the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>, and <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00245" reg="nearbymention:Sheridan,P.,H.,,"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> knows it; <persName n="Early,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00246" reg="nearbymention:Early,Jubal,,,"><surname>Early</surname></persName> had not been reinforced before the battle, and he knew that too. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/> Our people have become so much accustomed to the vicissitudes of war that they are not easily affected by the receipt of unpromising news.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>They know well, however, that the <rs type="place">Valley</rs> is not given up and that there is no intention of giving it up. This battle, in all its points, resembles the battle of <placeName key="tgn,7014152" n="1.000 7" reg="eutaw, greene, alabama">Eutaw</placeName> in the old revolution, where <persName n="Green,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00247" reg="mostcommon:Green,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Green</surname></persName>, after gaining a great victory, was finally obliged to quit the field, with the loss of all, or nearly all, his artillery, carrying off, however, a large body of prisoners he had taken, and crippling the enemy so badly that he not only did not pursue him, but was never after able to face him in the field again.--<persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00248" reg="nearbymention:Early,Jubal,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName> appears to have all the pertinacity which distinguished <persName n="Green,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00249" reg="mostcommon:Green,nomatch:0"><surname>Green</surname></persName>; and he has hurt <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00250" reg="nearbymention:Sheridan,P.,H.,,"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> far more than <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00251" reg="nearbymention:Sheridan,P.,H.,,"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> has hurt him. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
