<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/> We are on the threshold of important, probably of decisive events.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>The armies of the <num value="2">two</num> sections are in immediate contact with catch other in full force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>The enemy are pushing their lines into our territory, and our own men are cagier for combat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>The next week of fortnight will witness a series of engagement, which will go far to indicate the issue of the war. The enemy may outnumber us largely and the problem to be solved is, whether the <rs>South</rs> will make up in prowess what it lacks in numbers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/> So far, the enemy has had every advantage over us in his facilities for collecting armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>He was much nearer the present seat of the war. His large cities enabled him to recruit troops more rapidly, and his railroads and extensive shipping to concentrate them more readily in their present encampments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>He had the military organization of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> all ready to his hands; he had an arm; and navy complete at all points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>He had an old established government machinery in full operation, and vast resources at command maritime, financial, political and military. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/> The South, on the contrary, had everything to organise from revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>She had a new Government to erect and to furnish and equip in its numerous departments and <num value="1000">thousand</num> perplexing details.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>She had no Navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>She had no Army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>She had to set diligently to work in preparing her defences before yet her civil organization, which was to call armies into the field and to direct their operations was itself completed and in action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>She had to collect arms, to establish an <orgName n="Ordnance Bureau" type="bureau">Ordnance Bureau</orgName>, to organize a Commissariat, and to create an entire staff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>She had to collect large forces from an extensive and sparsely populated territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>She had to transport them vast distances to such points as the enemy himself threatened, and not such as she should select as the battle-ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>In fact, she had to meet the enemy more than half way.--While she was engaged in the important work of organization, the enemy was devoting his whole attention to the creation and transportation of armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>The enemy thus gained time upon her &mdash; time which, it must be confessed, he has very poorly improved. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/> For as yet he has, with all his advantages accomplished nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>Except in remote portions of our territory, like <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Northwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName>, he has nowhere penetrated into the interior of our country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>He hangs timidly and doubtfully upon our borders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>He has been there many weeks, idle and inert, while we have been bringing forward from great distances our troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>His reconnaissances have been disastrous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>They have been more; they have been disgraceful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>At <placeName reg="Fairfax Court-House">Fairfax Court-House</placeName> and <placeName reg="Great Bethel">Great Bethel</placeName>, at the<placeName reg="8mile Bridge">Eight-mile Bridge</placeName>, on the <placeName key="tgn,7008139" n="1.000 84" reg="hampshire">Hampshire</placeName> road, he has been whipped beyond the power of his mendacious writers to conceal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>This is the prominent fact of his invasion so far, that he has nowhere marched forth from his lines with a bold step and offered us battle upon equal terms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/> On our side, we have never failed to encounter him on almost any terms he would offer, or to whip him when it has come to a fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>We have so far, not provoked important engagements, preferring to await the collection of larger forces, and solicitous to drill our men well before leading them into action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>We have preferred, in the face of large odds, and for the cake of discipline and reinforcements, to stand on the defensive. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/> But we are now just beginning to be ready, and the impetuosity of our men can no longer be restrained with prudence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>The <rs>North</rs> is marching down upon our lines with great force, relying upon his numbers, and hoping thus to win ground by striking us with dismay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>It is now to be seen what reception he will meet with in attempting this sort of tactics upon our brave troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>We of the <rs>South</rs> have no doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>We are as impatient of the tidings of battle as we are confident of the issue. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/> The moment, however, is a very serious <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>A great deal hangs upon the events of a few days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>It is to be decided whether the <rs>Southern</rs> or the <rs>Northern</rs> soldier is the braver and better warrior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>It is to be decided whether the prestige of the <rs>Union</rs> and the <orgName n="Stars and Stripes" type="newspaper">Stars and Stripes</orgName> is a stronger inspiration than the love of Liberty and of our invaded country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/><placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> is to know whether the <rs>South</rs> can maintain her character as a belligerent power, and whether her independence is a probable event.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>The <rs>North</rs> is to know whether the <rs>South</rs> is the feeble and helpless country it has been brought to think.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>The question of conquest is not involved; no power on earth can subdue the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>The question is of our equality at a political power and as a martial combatant. </p> </div3>

<head>Causes of fire at sea.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/> The attention of scientific men has been of late much drawn to the causes of the burning of vessels at sea, causes which are often quite occult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>Chemical investigation has been directed to the subject by competent persons in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>, who have found that shipments are often made in the most careless manner, risking hundreds of lives and tens of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>It was shown in <num value="1">one</num> case that a package, which contained apothecary wares, broke and emitted a peculiar kind of odor.--This was caused by the spilling of sweet spirits of nitre, <num value="1">one</num> gallon of which would produce <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> cubic feet of explosive vapor, enough to blow up several men-of-war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>A committee was appointed to collect and dispense such material as may be needed for garments, &#x0026;c., for the sick and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>Another committee was appointed to engage competent nurses for the different camps and hospitals, and to accept the services of any who may volunteer to act as nurses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>Plans have been adopted to continue such supply of funds as can be collected here, and we are encouraged to believe that we are prepared for any call that is likely to be made upon us at this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>We shall, however, need eventually the co-operation of our sisters through out the <rs>State</rs>, and therefore we would suggest that in every county and in every community societies be formed at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>Whatever amounts can be raised, let them be forwarded as soon as possible to our Treasurer, <persName n="Price,Mrs.,Samuel,M.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00114" reg="default:Price,Samuel,M.,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <foreName>Samuel</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Price</surname></persName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/> We will say in conclusion, that the most of those who may be wounded in any battle that may take place will be brought here; still, as already mentioned, we propose to send nurses and comforts to the different camps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/> <placeName reg="Fort Garry">Garry</placeName> G is <num value="1">one</num> of those curious homogeneous specimens, denominated in vulgar parlance horse jockeys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/><placeName reg="Fort Garry">Garry</placeName> has become notorious for his skill and proficiency in the subtle science of getting the best of his antagonist in a horse deal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/>The locale of his operations in the good old <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> city of <placeName reg="Schenectady, Schenectady, New York" key="tgn,7014489">Schenectady</placeName> and vicinity, scores of whose burly farmers can testify to <placeName reg="Fort Garry">Garry</placeName>'s exceeding ingenuity in palming upon them horses which were to all appearance perfectly sound on the day of barter, but the succeeding morning evinced symptoms of heaves, or something worse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>But he was not always so successful, occasionally catching a tartar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/>We are acquainted with a little episode in <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> G.'s history, that came near lifting the glory from his laurel covered brow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>It happened thus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>Dan., P., an accommodating adjunct and fellow of the fraternity <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">de vavallos,</hi></foreign> got terribly stuck with the finest model of a <num value="4">four</num>-year-old sorrel mare that ever graced the turf.--Being in possession of considerable property, he dared not guarantee her sound, in case a purchaser was obtained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>She had cost the nice little sum of <measure n="200dollars" type="currency">$200</measure>, no barter, spondulicks down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>He finally bethought himself of his famous contemporary, <placeName reg="Fort Garry">Garry</placeName> G., who had previously assisted him under similar circumstances, and as the city of S. was but <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> off and the darkness of the evening favorable to his purposes, he concluded to hitch up his team and go to the city immediately, leading the mare, in order to fatigue her as little as possible, which being accomplished, he went in pursuit of <persName><foreName>Garry</foreName></persName>, who was found without difficulty at the horse-traders' rendezvous, surrounded as usual by a group of his <q>&#x0022;style of feather.&#x0022;</q> <placeName reg="Dan">Dan</placeName> stood treat all around and then took <persName><foreName>Garry</foreName></persName> <num value="1">one</num> side. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/> <q>&#x0022;<placeName reg="Fort Garry">Garry</placeName>, I want your assistance to get chunk's on <num value="1">one</num> of the handsomest pieces of horse flesh ever buckled to a sulky.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>She cost me an even <measure n="200dollars" type="currency">$200</measure>, and took in by a greeny at that.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/> <q>&#x0022;Well, what is she worth?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/> <q>&#x0022;Not a feed of oats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>I can sell her if I'd guarantee, but that won't do for me, you know.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/> <q>&#x0022;I'll tell you what, <placeName reg="Dan">Dan</placeName>, if you'll give me a couple of sawbucks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>I'll find you a customer.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/> <q>&#x0022;Agreed, providing that I shall not be responsible.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/> <q>&#x0022;That's just the thing I'm a-going to fix.--The boys are all anxious for a trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/>You can go in and offer to deal; show your beast, and tell them you will give a written guarantee that she is sound, kind and true; work to any harness, single or double; set her up so steep that none of them will take you up; mostly sell to me, and deliver her in presence of the boys, so that they will think the affair a <hi rend="italics">bank fide.</hi> operation; after that leave the work to me, I'll fetch the money out of her.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/> <placeName reg="Dan">Dan</placeName>, satisfied with this arrangement, sauntered into the bar room, offered his mare for batter, warranting her perfect in every particular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>All the compatible dealing stock was immediately produced, liberal boat tendered, in exchange; but <persName n="Dan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00399" reg="mostcommon:Dan,Frederick,,,:1"><surname>Dan</surname></persName> would not close.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>The most anxious of the party was <persName><foreName>Fred</foreName></persName> W., an old stager and rival of <placeName reg="Fort Garry">Garry</placeName>'s. <persName><foreName>Fred</foreName></persName> offered a sound <num value="8">8</num>-year-old gelding and <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">$100</measure>, which he afterwards increased to <measure n="125dollars" type="currency">$125</measure> <placeName reg="Dan">Dan</placeName> <sic>perempt rily</sic> refusing until <placeName reg="Fort Garry">Garry</placeName>'s offer reached even <measure n="200dollars" type="currency">$200</measure>, which he accepted, closed the bargain by exchanging property, treated the company, and retired for the night. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/> Next morning, between the hours of <num value="5">five</num> and <num value="6">six</num>, <placeName reg="Fort Garry">Garry</placeName> was disturbed from his slumber by <persName><foreName>Fred</foreName></persName> W., who had come at this early hour to make an offer for the mare ahead of competition. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/> <placeName reg="Fort Garry">Garry</placeName>, nothing loth, dressed himself, and went out to the stable, accompanied by <persName><foreName>Fred</foreName></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/> <q>&#x0022;There she is, old boy, a good <measure n="300dollars" type="currency">$300</measure> worth; <placeName reg="Dan">Dan</placeName>, has warranted her every way right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>She must bring me a pile before she leaves that crib.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/> <q>&#x0022;<placeName reg="Fort Garry">Garry</placeName>, there is no use a blowin' about the mare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>I know as much about a horse as you do. If you want my brown gelding and <measure n="135dollars" type="currency">$135</measure> cash, say the word and it's a dicker.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/> <q>&#x0022;Make it <measure n="150dollars" type="currency">$150</measure>, and we'll say no more about it; there is a wagon and harness, you can <persName n="Litch,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00400" reg="mostcommon:Litch,nomatch:0"><surname>Litch</surname></persName> up and try her as long as you please.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/> <q>&#x0022;I don't want to try her, <placeName reg="Dan">Dan</placeName> has guaranteed her to you, and that's enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/>I am satisfied she is all right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/>I'll just split the difference and not <num value="1">one</num> cent more.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/> <q>&#x0022;Well, it's a trade; fetch along your horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>I know all about him any way.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/> <q>&#x0022;There's the money that binds the bargain.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/> The bargain having been concluded, <placeName reg="Fort Garry">Garry</placeName> called upon D.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/><placeName reg="Dan">Dan</placeName> insisted that the sale between them was bona fide, and was made in the presence of witnesses, and that if he had given <measure n="200dollars" type="currency">$200</measure> for a horse not worth <measure n="1dollars" type="currency">one dollar</measure>, it was his own fault. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/>Seeing no resistance, the wolf leaped upon the bed to devour the tender prey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/>Seized with a sudden fright, these <num value="2">two</num> boys slipped under the mattress, and there lay flat without breathing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/>So near the flesh and not being able to reach it immediately, the murderous animal became more excited; he began to tear the bedclothes to shreds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/>Weak as these obstacles were, nevertheless they were the saving of the boys' lives.
