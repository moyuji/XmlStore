<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>So sudden did we spring on them and pass them, that more than a <num value="100">hundred</num> Zouaves were left in our rear, and were made prisoners of by our straggling soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>It was in this pursuit that the celebrated <orgName type="mil" key="RIBattery">Rhode Island battery</orgName> was captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>The small loss sustained by the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 2">Second Regiment</orgName>, in killed and wounded, must not be taken as an indication that they were not in the hottest of the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>When it is remembered that much of their fighting was accomplished while lying on the ground, and the enemy's balls going over their heads, the reason why so few were killed is readily understood. W. P. P. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>At the time of the <hi rend="italics">Herald's</hi> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> appearance in New York, journalism was respectable; the editors were mostly gentlemen and scholars; the press in general was distinguished by moral character, as well as intelligence and dignity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>What a life of usefulness a man wielding such a potent machinery for good might wield, and what a death, full of consoling memories and bright hopes, he might die!.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>Its morality was hideous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>All that is sacred in religion or in the domestic circle has been scoffed at openly, or sneered at insidiously in its columns, whilst the most shameless vice hung out its signboard among its advertisements as boldly and conspicuously as any legitimate branch of business or trade.
