<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> An eloquent Divine remarked, in a late sermon, that &#x0022;no generous mind desires a victim.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> No <num value="1">one</num> will doubt the truth of this observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>But the misfortune is, that generous minds are not as plentiful as Confederate notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>They are not even as abundant as gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>A good many respectable imitations may be found, but the hard times has, in most cases, worn off even the gilding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Here and there, there is a <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs>--a real <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> of the times of the <rs>Republic</rs>--<num value="1">one</num> who actually lives on corn bread and water,--which even a <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs>, for good and sufficient reasons, never attempted,--and, on that spare diet, keeps up a most blooming and robust patriotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>These <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> spirits would be willing to live in like manner till the end of time rather than be up to the eyes in fleshpots at the price of subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>We know some such persons, never heard of in public places, and not desiring to be heard of &mdash; only asking to be free of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>But for <num value="1">one</num> <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> of the <rs>Republic</rs>, there are, in general, <num value="9">nine</num> <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Romans</rs> of the <rs>Empire</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>For <num value="1">one</num> honest soul, that really practices self-denial, there are <num value="9">nine</num> that devote themselves to descriptions of that excellent virtue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>There never was so large a proportion of preachers to people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/><num value="9">Nine</num> well-fed and well-clothed orators, holding forth upon the glory of starving and being starved, and <num value="1">one</num> man, who composes the congregation and believes all that he hears, and practices the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The <num value="1">one</num> man will have his reward, but, most assuredly, not in this world. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> We should like to believe that there are many unselfish, generous minds who do not desire to victimize anybody, whether an ox or a President.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>But that the <name>Scriptural</name> account of human nature, as read by the light of the war, is a life-like portrait which nobody can mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>A good many of the most intelligent and virtuous of mankind turn out, upon close handling, to be deceitful and desperately wicked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>In particular, the propensity for having a victim is as universal as humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Whether the object be a hare or a deer, or any kind of domestic game; whether it be a member of the family, the community, or the nation; having a victim is an appetite which has no bounds, except the ability of the victim to resist and retaliate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>It is that which makes the war upon the <rs>South</rs> so exhilarating to <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republicans</rs>; they can strike and we cannot strike back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>It is that also which is our own consolation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>If we cannot strike back at them, we can pummel each other, and thereby relieve our natural indignation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> The great use and advantage of an Executive in times of war is to have somebody to blame and abuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The <rs>Earl</rs> of <placeName reg="Chatham, Ontario, Canada" key="tgn,7016856">Chatham</placeName> was the only man that ever escaped this all but universal fate of <rs type="role2">Presidents</rs> and Premiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>It is true, he was just the most self-willed, arbitrary and overbearing man that ever lived, and was so absolutely determined to have the control of measures, of which he had the sole responsibility, that he compelled the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <rs type="role" reg="Lord">Lord</rs> of the <rs>Admiralty</rs> to sign naval orders issued by the <name>Premier</name> &mdash; while the writing was covered over from his eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/><placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, grumbling, growling <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> &mdash; then, &#x0022;for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time and for the last time, presented the astonishing picture of a nation supporting, without murmur, a widely-extended and costly war, and a people, hitherto torn with conflicting parties, so united in the service of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> that the voice of faction had ceased in the land, and any discordant whisper was heard no more.&#x0022; But then a nation would be hard to satisfy that, from universal disaster, was raised by the hand <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> of <persName n="Pitt,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Pitt,nomatch:0"><surname>Pitt</surname></persName> to a career of the most uninterrupted success ever known in the history of Christianity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> With this exception, an Executive, in war times, must expect to be the target for such of his countrymen as like a victim constantly to practice upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>He must expect to be pounded, and maimed, and belabored, as did the amiable Quill, the image of the ancient <rs>Admiral</rs>, whom he was always beating with iron pokers, and screwing gimlets into, and sticking forks into his eyes, and cutting his name on him, meaning to burn the old fellow at last. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Without deciding whether those rebellions were justifiable, or whether they were wrong, or whether the <rs>Southern</rs> rebellion is justifiable or not, <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName> says: <q>&#x0022;The mere fact of rebellion is not, in my eyes, a crime of so deep a dye that we must renounce all fellowship and communion and relationship with those who have been guilty of it. I own I cannot but wonder to see the offspring of <num value="3">three</num> rebellions really speaking like the <name>Czar</name> of <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>, the <name>Sultan</name> of <placeName key="tgn,1000144" n="1.000 41" reg="turkiye">Turkey</placeName>, or <persName><foreName>Louis</foreName> <genName n="14">XIV</genName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>himself, of the dreadful crime and guilt of rebellion.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> What adds to the audacity of this outcry, is the simple fact that there has been no rebellion at all, unless it be that of the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> party against the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>There must be allegiance to a government acknowledged before resistance of its authority becomes rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The States never owed any such allegiance to their agency at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>They were the sovereigns, to whom, and to whom alone, the supreme allegiance of their respective inhabitants was due. </p> </div3>

<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> For being allowed the privilege of once more writing you from a point of safety, after experiencing a most dangerous trip from <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName>, I feel the profoundest gratitude to the <rs>Almighty Being</rs>, to whose mercy alone I attribute the fact of our not being lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The opening of this letter will no doubt fill you with the same feeling; and knowing that you will be eager for them, I will give some of the particulars, which can never be effaced from my memory. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> Just before leaving the coast of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, I wrote M., informing her of our expected departure on the night previous to <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct>, which letter I hope she has received. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> Night arrived, and about <time value="12mid">12 M.</time> we got under way, having no difficulty in evading the <orgName n="Blockading Squadron" type="squadron">blockading squadron</orgName>, from the fact that nearly all the ships had been called off from the &#x0022;bar&#x0022; (over which we passed) to participate in the attack on <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName> above, the whole of which I witnessed with great satisfaction, particularly when I discovered that our guns were having such telling effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The next day dawned upon us most beautifully, the sun almost surpassing himself in the brilliancy of his rays, and the ocean smoother than it gets to be once in <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>, according to the statements of those who are supposed to know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Onward our little steamer sped, seemingly conscious of the task before her, and every <num value="1">one</num> on board in the highest spirits, little aware of the peril through which we had to pass, and the terrible amount of mental suffering to be borne before reaching our point of destination. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/> Thus passed the anniversary of the birth of our <rs type="role2">Lord</rs> and Saviour, with no incident worth mentioning, except the having to go at top speed twice during the day to escape a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> cruiser, which lay off the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> stream, causing us to leave our course some <num value="60">sixty</num> or <measure n="70miles" type="distance">seventy miles</measure>, but which, instead of exciting the least alarm, served only to make the time more interesting. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> Retiring to my berth about the usual time, my slumbers were disturbed towards day by the rapid rocking of the ship, which I was soon afterwards informed was occasioned by a heavy wind, which had sprung up during the night, tossing the sea up to what I considered a fearful height, but which, in comparison to what ensued the following night, amounted to nothing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> Monday came and passed, the roughness of the water not permitting us to make quite as much headway as the day before; but towards the afternoon the wind increased in fury, rendering it dangerous for a person to show his head outside the cabin, and causing the breakers to dash across the deck at a terrible rate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>In the meantime, there was much sea-sickness, with which I myself suffered very little, as I anticipated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> The next morning, the wind and sea having subsided considerably, was the time appointed for our arrival at St. Georges, but when <time value="4oclock">four o'clock</time> arrived, and the man at the masthead failed to sing out &#x0022;land ahead,&#x0022; the re-action in my feelings was indescribably awful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>It is painful to think of even now. Upon examination, we found we were lost somewhere in the <placeName reg="Atlantic Ocean" key="tgn,7014206">Atlantic ocean</placeName>, but exactly where we did not know, with only <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> coal and a very small amount of provisions and water on hand. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/> <hi rend="italics">The great anxiety for a speedy termination of the war, which exists both here and at the <rs>South</rs>,</hi> is leading many people to overrate the importance and probable results of the &#x0022;overtures&#x0022; now making through the medium of <persName n="Blair,Mister,Francis,P.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00096" reg="default:Blair,Francis,P.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Francis</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Blair</surname></persName>--though it is doubtful if they are even worthy of being called &#x0022;overtures,&#x0022; inasmuch as that implies a readiness on the part of those making them to abandon the arbitrament of arms and depend wholly on a settlement through negotiation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>We are quite sure that no <num value="1">one</num> connected with our Government, whose position qualifies him to judge, entertains the serious belief that anything tangible will grow out of the very delicate diplomacy going on between <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00097" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> and <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>We hazard little in predicting that those views will be a reiteration of the demand for independence and recognition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>Whether this demand will be made simply as the confirmed and unalterable determination of the insurgent leaders, or for the purpose of extorting ultimately the most liberal concessions from their conquerors, time can only tell.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/> But the most significant thing connected with this peace question, is the fact that it is agitated so vigorously, not to say vehemently, far and wide, among the people, and to some extent among the public men, of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>Whatever may be <persName n="Davis,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00101" reg="nearbymention:Davis,William,A.,,"><surname>Davis</surname></persName>'s personal action and desire, this agitation must seriously embarrass him, and in the end give him an enemy to fight to which he must succumb.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>It is the most encouraging development of public sentiment yet made in the progress of the war. It is an index of the breaking down of the will, the moral strength, of the people of the <rs>South</rs>, which has been effected by our grand military successes of the past <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>. <hi rend="italics">A war simply upon the physical resources of the <rs>South</rs> could never produce such an effect,</hi> but achievements like that of the fall of <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>, the march through <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, the fall of <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, the rout of <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00102" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName>, the capture of <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName> and the consequent closing of the port of <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName>, together with the ominous opening of <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00103" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s new campaign, all combine to produce that mental despondency on the part of the people, the result of which is this shattering of the <hi rend="italics">will,</hi> which has thus far sustained the rebellion; and in its train we may look for the consequent dissensions, confusion <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> and disruption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>It is hardly necessary, therefore, to point to the conclusion, which inevitably follows, that a continuation of the military success which has brought about the present state of affairs must necessarily prove the most potent peace-making influence which can be brought to bear at this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>The &#x0022;last ditch&#x0022; idea of the <rs>Southern</rs> people was always a fallacy, as regards the chief part of the population, and could only apply to a desperate few.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>He enters alone; and, all heated with the combat, his hand still trembling from the blows which he had dealt, he writes a few lines upon a sheet of fine and perfumed paper.--At this moment, Beillard appears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>I owe him my blood, my life; but my honor is my own, Beillard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>Do you hear, Beillard!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>my honor is mine own, I say, and I was brave before he was an Emperor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>Go, and carry the billet.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/> &#x0022;Sire,&#x0022; replied Beillard, warmly, &#x0022;you are indebted to him for a crown, the dignity of which you should not compromise by a quarrel with an officer of the <rs>Empire</rs>.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/> &#x0022;A crown!&#x0022; interrupted <persName n="Murat,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00258" reg="mostcommon:Murat,nomatch:0"><surname>Murat</surname></persName>, with increasing exasperation; &#x0022;has this crown prevented me from being insulted to my face!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>These,&#x0022; he added, with stern joy, as he grasped his sabre and his pistols, &#x0022;these have caused me to be respected all my life, and they will not fail me now. Go, then, Beillard, go!&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/> &#x0022;You are a king,&#x0022; replied the chief, &#x0022;and <persName n="Davoust,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00259" reg="mostcommon:Davoust,nomatch:0"><surname>Davoust</surname></persName> will refuse.&#x0022; </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/> &#x0022;It is not true,&#x0022; replied Beillard, suddenly; and he gazed proudly at the <rs>King</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7004474" n="1.000 3" reg="napoli,napoli,campania,italia,europe">Naples</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>At these words he glared for a moment with an air of stupor at the chief of his staff, who stood calm and resolute before him. Suddenly the face of the <rs>King</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7004474" n="1.000 3" reg="napoli,napoli,campania,italia,europe">Naples</placeName> changed its expression; his anger leaves him; his brow is clouded with grief, and <persName n="Murat,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00262" reg="mostcommon:Murat,nomatch:0"><surname>Murat</surname></persName> casts his weapons violently to the ground; he breaks them; he lends his garments; her tears off his sumptuous decorations and tramples them beneath his feet; he tries to speak, but the words are stifled in his throat &mdash; he weeps. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/> &#x0022;You are right,&#x0022; he cried, at last, to Beillard, &#x0022;he is not a coward, and he will refuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>I am a miserable king who can do nothing &mdash; a king whom the meanest soldier may insult!&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/> Big drops fell from the hero's eyes, and he covered his face with his hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>Beillard took advantage of this moment of weakness to remonstrate calmly with him; he soothed him, he flattered his pride, excited his courage, and ended with these words: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/> &#x0022;And if the <rs>Emperor</rs> should give the command of the vanguard to <persName n="Davoust,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00263" reg="mostcommon:Davoust,nomatch:0"><surname>Davoust</surname></persName>, he will do all that you would have done.&#x0022; </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/> &#x0022;Yes, yes!&#x0022; he exclaimed, with ardor, &#x0022;I will remain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>It is only here that there are battles &mdash; only here true glory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>Well, then, I will wrest it from him. All for myself, and nothing for him!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>Not a skirmish, Beillard!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>I swear to you he shall not see an enemy!&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/> With these words he left his tent and hastened to an outpost. </p>
