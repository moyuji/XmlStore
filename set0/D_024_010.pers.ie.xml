<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>During the earlier part of the action our corps remained on the reserve on the east side of the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Early in the morning climbed a tall tree, from the top of which I had a district view of the scene of battle at its commencement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>After being there attentively occupied for some time, orders came to our division, commanded by <persName n="Griffin,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00031" reg="nearbymention:Griffin,Madison,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Griffin</surname></persName>, to cross the river, and the bugle sound to &#x0022;fall in&#x0022; brought me down in double quick, and instead of being a curious spectator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>I soon became a shatter in the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>This battle was fought on a remarkable small space of ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>To the rear of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, that is claiming the front of the city to be on the river, there is a plain of about half a mile in acres, which terminate, in a ridge of steep hill, where the enemy had taken up his position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>This was the plain where <persName n="Sumner,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00032" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Generals</roleName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName>'s and <orgName n="Grand Divisions"><persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00033" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,nomatch:0"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName>'s Grand Divisions</orgName> fought and attempted to storm those works of the enemy which <persName n="Burnside,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="nearbymention:Burnside,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Burnside</surname></persName> has denominated the &#x0022;key to their position.&#x0022; From morning till night assault after assault was repeated to gain possession of those heights, but the many desperate efforts of our troops met with failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>We were defeated because bravery and human endurance were unequal to the undertaking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>When we charged across the open field, the concentrated, withering fire of the enemy swept everything be ore it, and fendered the accomplishment of our purpose an utter impossibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>Within about <measure n="150yards" type="distance">one hundred and fifty yards</measure> of the <unclear></unclear> of the range of hids there is a slight elevation on this otherwise level field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>To this small knoll we succeeded in advancing, and further it was not possible to go. Some of our best regiments attempted to pass beyond this knoll and charge on the rebel infantry posted a short distance off behind a stone wall but in the attempt were invariably all but annihilated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>This slight rise, although not exceeding <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> in height, afforded us a great dealt of shelter and were it not for this advantage we could not have obtained any portion of the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>It is the prevailing opinion that had the attack been made at any other point we would have had a Glorious victory instead of a shameful defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>All that were engaged fought most bravely, and in no battle of the war have our troops displayed greater valor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>There was no panic, no skulking, except now and then an occasional case, nor any other exhibition of cowardice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>Men could not have done better, and wherever the fault belongs it certainly does not rest with the rank and file.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>Even the enemy acknowledges this fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>At nightfall the slaughter ceased. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/> With the impression that the battle would be renewed the next morning, we lay down on the field among the feed and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>What a pleasure it would have given us to aid in abstaining this suffering is such though was not in our power, with out transgressing our orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>Every man was then required at his post; none could be spared to go to the rear with the wounded. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>The cold shivering of those wounded men, their incessant touching appeals for help, and the low morning of those paining from time to eternity, made up a combination of scud that would make the brain real and the heart of any human being bleed with play. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/> We &mdash; that is that few of us that could contrive to fall asleep during the night &mdash; were around a to-day brink by the sound of a volley of musketry coming from the enemy's pickets, which at the time we supposed to be the opening of another day's butchery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>After firing a few volleys in return we were ordered to create firing and lay low.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/> In she it, it is a war between States and populations who are all allied to us by blood, who are all <unclear></unclear> to our eternal gratitude by the munificent chastity with which they strove to feed our people when starving under the <rs>English</rs> rule, who have all constantly afforded's friendly refuge to our people when driven from their native country by the curse of that rule, who have all shown pity for our suffering under a fore gayoke and given sympathy and encouragement to our aspirations after independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>To a mere <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> patriot, the honor and prosperity of North and of South are equally dear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>What a spectacle for him &mdash; the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs> contending against each other as the dead inst of themes!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>If he feels that his voice can have no influence over the combatants, he may well be a lent while like The <rs>O'Donoghue</rs>, he gazes up-on the fratricidal conflict &#x0022;with streaming eye&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/> But, though such considerations as those have hitherto withheld me from any public declaration as to the right and wrong in this unhappy war they have not prevented me from the free expression of my sentiments among my friends in conversation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>And latterly I have begun to doubt the propriety of keeping silence while strenuous efforts are being made by several persons to represent all the true Nationalists of <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName> as partizans of the <rs>North</rs>, and to prove that the hopes of our national cause depend upon the success of the <rs>North</rs> in this war </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/> It was, therefore, with a feeling of relief that I read your article of last Saturday and the letter of your correspondent, who signs him if, &#x0022;Aldrich American&#x0022; At all events let the truth be known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>All true <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> Naturalists are not partisan of the <rs>North</rs> in this war. I do not believe that a majority of them are partisans of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>Cousinly. I am not. I desire and hops that the <rs>North</rs> may never succeed in its attempt to subjugate the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>I sympathize with my whole heart with the people of the <rs>South</rs>, defending their homes and liberty against the inviting armies of those who were lately their fellow citizens, to whom they have done no wrong, and of whom they desire nothing but to be allowed <unclear></unclear> depart in peace from the political partnership which they dislike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>Resisting hostile invasion, fighting to save themselves from a yoke of a conqueror the people of the <rs>South</rs> are defending a that and holy cause, and they are defending it against tremendous odds with such gallantry, endurance, devoted patriotic, heroic virtues as have never been surpassed in the whole history of wars of independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>A most noble people has there to take its place among the nation, and, springing to arms in defence of its rights, has at once presented before the world a national army so good and beautiful that the proudest of empires might emulate it. In at steamship and military gentus in the courage and discipline that make up for inferiority of numbers and of arms, in the devotedness of the women, in the lefty spirit of national honor that animation a unanimous population the <rs>South</rs> possesses defences that enthuse her to the victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>Bit the victory is not always to the righteous cause, nor to the best and bravest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>It may be that the greatly superior resource of the <rs>Northern States</rs> will enable them in time to <unclear></unclear> the defenders of the <rs>South</rs>, and to cut legate the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>I hope not. But victors or vanquished my sympathies are wholly with the people of the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/> I find that I have enlarged so much in the mere expression of my individual feelings, concerning the war between <name>North</name> and <name>South</name> that I must not attempt in this letter to argue the question between them, nor to discuss the beatings of the war upon our <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> national policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>Indeed is may suffice to say that I agree in everything with your leading article, and also with the letter of &#x0022;An <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> American&#x0022; </p> <closer> <salute>I am, dear sir, sincerely yours,</salute> <signed><persName n="Martin,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00043" reg="default:Martin,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName>  <surname>Martin</surname></persName>.</signed> </closer> </div5> </div4>
