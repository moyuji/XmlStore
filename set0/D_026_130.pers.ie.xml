<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> There was some heavy skirmishing on <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>, in which we suffered some loss, and have reason to believe that more was insisted upon the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>We are informed that a portion of <orgName n="division"><persName n="Rodes,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Rodes,nomatch:0"><surname>Rodes</surname></persName>'s division</orgName>, supported by <unclear></unclear> was sent forward to feel the position of the enemy, and came upon them in the neighborhood of <placeName reg="Betheeds Church">Betheeds Church</placeName>, in Honorer col. A right ensued, in which the enemy were driven back some <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> or more when our troops came upon the enemy breastworks and fell back. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> Meanwhile, <persName n="Battle,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Battle,nomatch:0"><surname>Battle</surname></persName>'s and <orgName n="brigades"><persName n="Daniel,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Daniel,William,W.,,:1"><surname>Daniel</surname></persName>'s brigades</orgName> flanked the enemy's line of skirmishers, and succeeded in capturing <measure n="125" type="prisoners">125 prisoners</measure>, who were received here last evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Some of these prisoners stated that their &#x0022;time was <unclear></unclear> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>, and seemed to think it a hard case that they should have been captured at that interesting period. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> <measure n="8" type="prisoners">Eight prisoners</measure>, including a captain and a quartermaster, were also brought in yesterday afternoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> Large signal fires were observed on the enemy's lines on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, indicating, it is supposed, some movement on their part. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> Contrary to the popular expectation, no general engagement took place yesterday.--The heavy firing heard in the morning gave rise to <unclear>lle</unclear> that a battle was in progress, but it turned out to be skirmishing on the lines, with artillery duels at intervals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>A rumor was extensively circulated during the day that <persName n="Ewell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Ewell,nomatch:0"><surname>Ewell</surname></persName> had on engagement with the enemy and drove him back some <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure>, capturing <measure n="500" type="prisoners">500 prisoners</measure>; but of this there is no confirmation. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>What truth there was in these rumors we have, thus far, been unable to learn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>But it seems certain that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00222" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> had determined to make the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName> the base of his operations against this city, and that he expected to take it. How far his views may be changed by the publication of his plans, remains to be seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>Besides, our communications are open in all directions, and can only be temporarily interrupted by parties of cavalry, which will always be followed up too closely to allow time for doing much damage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>Upon the whole, our prospects seem very fair, so far as a siege is concerned, and should <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00229" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> prefer to contest the possession of the place in a pitched battle, we feel no apprehension whatever for the issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>Not a man seemed to doubt how it would terminate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>There was no fear and scarcely any excitement.--That the defeat of the enemy was to be the result of a battle, seemed to be regarded as certain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>The army have the same confidence in themselves, and faith in their commander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>It must be a much larger force than <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00233" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> commands, and a much greater General than stands in his shoes, the can overcome such a force, led by such a General. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>There are few who do not feel it, and bless <name n="God" type="God">God</name> when they acknowledge it, for sending us so great a General to lead so brave an army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>A very large proportion of the <rs>French</rs> loss was incurred after the rout, the <name>Prussian</name> huggars giving no quarter, but sabring the fugitives without mercy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>This estimate, however, is as evidently too high as that of <num value="20000">20,000</num> is too low.
