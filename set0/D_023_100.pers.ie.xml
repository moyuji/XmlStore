<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Between <time value="10">ten</time> and <time value="11oclock">eleven o'clock</time>, the water from the river began rising in our yard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>We closed our blinds and windows, and put up the typhoon bars in front, then began moving chairs, books, &#x0026;c., in towards the backside of the sitting-room, as the wind was driving the rain in fast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The river looked terrific.

<head>Recognition.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/> We believe it was <persName n="Trim,Corporal,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00127" reg="mostcommon:Trim,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Corporal">Corporal</roleName> <surname>Trim</surname></persName>, or some other equally sage here of romance, who said that when he went into battle he counted himself already dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>If he should be killed he would lose nothing by that system of calculation; if he should come out safe, in life and limb, he should be so much the gainer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>A very neat contrivance this was to ensure against loss in a game generally thought to be the most hazardous and most doubtful of all others. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/> With regard to the recognition of this Republic by the powers of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, we have concluded to follow a practice analogous to that of <persName n="Trim,Corporal,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00128" reg="mostcommon:Trim,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Corporal">Corporal</roleName> <surname>Trim</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>We simply disbelieve everything we hear, so that, as each rumor explodes, we loss nothing.--Should it turn out hereafter that some report yet to come should be something more than mere rumor, we shall consider it so much clear gain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>We are not disposed to think any such pregnant rumor is yet in being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>We cannot call ourselves of the family of <persName n="Didymus,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00129" reg="mostcommon:Didymus,nomatch:0"><surname>Didymus</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>We have no doubts at all. Our convictions are positive enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>We do not believe a word of all the statements <q>&#x0022;upon reliable authority&#x0022;</q> that were in circulation last week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>We do not believe that <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> have the slightest idea of recognizing our independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>When we see it we may <hi rend="italics">possibly</hi> believe it &mdash; we are not entirely certain that we shall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>It has been a part of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> game, from the beginning of this war, to make us put faith in the intervention of the great <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>They are pursuing it more zealously now than they ever have been before, because they are on the eve of the greatest effort they have ever yet made to crush us, and they wish to throw us a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time off our guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>They tried it last year, and they came very near succeeding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>We were not roused until it was almost too late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>Our authorities understand the game better now. They will not be caught napping a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>So the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> newspapers must try some other device. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/> To make the rumor more plausible than it otherwise might have been, it was asserted on the streets, and in all companies <num value="1">one</num> might chance to fall into, last week, and repeated by all the newspapers &mdash; this among others &mdash; that <placeName key="tgn,1000063" n="1.000 67" reg="belgie">Belgium</placeName> had already acknowledged our independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>Now, <placeName key="tgn,1000063" n="1.000 67" reg="belgie">Belgium</placeName> being under the joint guardianship of <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, or presumed to be so, it is quite natural that she should be put forward to take the initiative in an affair of so much importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>The <rs>Belgians</rs> are strongly tinctured with <name>French</name> feeling; at least we should suppose so, for <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00130" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> says in his account of the <rs n="Battle of Waterloo" type="battle">battle of Waterloo</rs>, that <q>&#x0022;the <rs>English</rs> and <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> were equally detested there.&#x0022;</q> and thus much he learned from the inhabitants who came into his camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>The country belonged to ancient <persName n="Gaul,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00131" reg="mostcommon:Gaul,Transalpine,,,:1"><surname>Gaul</surname></persName>, and its inhabitants are mentioned by <unclear>C sar</unclear> in-the very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> chapter of his commentaries, as far surpassing all the other <rs>Gauls</rs> in valor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>Now, the greater part of <persName n="Gaul,,Transalpine,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00132" reg="default:Gaul,Transalpine,,,"><foreName>Transalpine</foreName> <surname>Gaul</surname></persName> is included in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName>, and as there was a strong family likeness, according to the same authority, between all the nations of ancient <persName n="Gaul,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00133" reg="nearbymention:Gaul,Transalpine,,,"><surname>Gaul</surname></persName>, it is natural that the affinity between the <rs>French</rs> and the <name>Belgians</name> should continue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>As long as the provinces had their counts, dukes, and free cities, that part of the low countries known now as <placeName key="tgn,1000063" n="1.000 67" reg="belgie">Belgium</placeName> always had <name>French</name> tendencies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>When they finally fell under the house of Burgundy towards the close of the <num value="14" type="ordinal">fourteenth</num> century, their rulers were still <persName n="French,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00134" reg="mostcommon:French,nomatch:0"><surname>French</surname></persName>, though independent of all but a merely nominal fealty to the <rs>King</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>When <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName></persName> the <name>Bold</name> was defeated and gain, a little management on the part of <persName><foreName>Louis</foreName> <genName n="11">XI</genName></persName> might have secured the whole low countries to <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName> forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/><persName n="Wise,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00135" reg="mostcommon:Wise,nomatch:0"><surname>Wise</surname></persName> politicians advised him to marry the <rs>Duke</rs> of <placeName reg="Orleans, Loiret, Centre" key="tgn,7008337">Orleans</placeName> afterwards <persName><foreName>Louis</foreName> <genName n="12">XII</genName></persName>., to <persName><foreName>Mary</foreName></persName> of Bargundy, the <persName n="Charles,IsFather,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00136" reg="mostcommon:Charles,nomatch:0"><roleName n="IsFather">daughter of</roleName> <surname>Charles</surname></persName>, who succeeded to all his <unclear>do </unclear> This would have accomplished the union at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>But we have always observed that otherwise men are sure to overreach themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/><persName><foreName>Louis</foreName></persName> wished the duke to marry his own deformed daughter <persName><foreName>Joan</foreName></persName>, and would not hear of the match.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>On the contrary he formed designs against the possessions of the young duchess, who, to obtain a powerful protector, gave her hand to <persName n="Maximilian,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00137" reg="mostcommon:Maximilian,nomatch:0"><surname>Maximilian</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Emperor">Emperor</rs> of <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, and her whole immaches possessions along with it. <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName> <genName n="5">V</genName></persName>., the grandson of <persName n="Maximilian,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00138" reg="mostcommon:Maximilian,nomatch:0"><surname>Maximilian</surname></persName>, who was <rs type="role" reg="Emperor">Emperor</rs> of <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, as well as <rs type="role" reg="King">King</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, inherited the low countries, and transmitted them to his son <persName><foreName>Philip</foreName> <genName n="2">II</genName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>All who have read <persName n="Motley,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00139" reg="mostcommon:Motley,nomatch:0"><surname>Motley</surname></persName>'s history of the <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> Republic will recollect in what manner the <num value="7">seven</num> United Provinces became severed from the crown of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>The <q>&#x0022;<rs n="Catholic" type="religion">Catholic</rs> Provinces of the <name>Netherlands</name>,&#x0022;</q> as they were called, <num value="10">ten</num> in number, and constituting what is now called <placeName key="tgn,1000063" n="1.000 67" reg="belgie">Belgium</placeName>, were transferred a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time to the <name>Crown</name> of <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> by the treaty of <placeName key="tgn,7006926" n="1.000 2" reg="utrecht,utrecht,nederland,europe">Utrecht</placeName>, in <dateStruct value="1714--"><year reg="1714">1714</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>They were among the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> conquests made by the <rs>French</rs> <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs>, in the beginning of the <name>Revolution</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>They were afterwards annexed to <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName> by <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00140" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>But the <name>Allies</name>, by the treaty of <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1814--"><year reg="1814">1814</year></dateStruct>, united them to <persName n="Holland,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00141" reg="mostcommon:Holland,nomatch:0"><surname>Holland</surname></persName>, and made the <rs>Prince</rs> of <placeName reg="Orange, Orange, Virginia" key="tgn,7014299">Orange</placeName> sovereign over both them and <persName n="Holland,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00142" reg="mostcommon:Holland,nomatch:0"><surname>Holland</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>By the treaty of <placeName reg="Vienna, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2114749">Vienna</placeName>, in <dateStruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></dateStruct>, the low countries were clubbed together, christened the <q>&#x0022;Kingdom of the <name>Netherlands</name>.&#x0022;</q> and made to receive a <q>&#x0022;<rs type="role" reg="King">King</rs> of the <name>Netherlands</name>,&#x0022;</q> in the person of the aforesaid <rs>Prince</rs> of <unclear>range.</unclear> That the <num value="10">ten</num> <rs n="Catholic" type="religion">Catholic</rs> Provinces were not restored to <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName>, (<rs type="role" reg="Emperor">the Emperor</rs> of <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> took the title of <rs type="role" reg="Emperor">Emperor</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></dateStruct>) was <unclear>scisly</unclear> owing to the repugnance of <persName><foreName>Francis</foreName> <genName n="2">II</genName></persName>., who said that they had been a source of vast expense and trouble to his predecessors, and had produced them nothing, and that therefore he would have nothing to do with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>The bestowal of them upon the <rs>Prince</rs> of <placeName reg="Orange, Orange, Virginia" key="tgn,7014299">Orange</placeName> was, therefore, the only way the <name>Allies</name> had left to get rid of the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>But, that the inhabitants did not like <persName n="Holland,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00143" reg="mostcommon:Holland,nomatch:0"><surname>Holland</surname></persName>, and did like <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName> is evident from the fact that as soon as <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName> revolted in <dateStruct value="1830--"><year reg="1830">1830</year></dateStruct>, the <rs n="Catholic" type="religion">Catholic</rs> Provinces followed their example, and petitioned to be united to <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>This <persName n="Philippe,,Louis,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00144" reg="default:Philippe,Louis,,,"><foreName>Louis</foreName> <surname>Philippe</surname></persName> would not consent to; but when a war ensued and the <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> had the best of it, he sent <persName n="Gerard,Marshal,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00145" reg="mostcommon:Gerard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Marshal">Marshal</roleName> <surname>Gerard</surname></persName> with a French army, who took <persName n="Antwerp,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00146" reg="mostcommon:Antwerp,nomatch:0"><surname>Antwerp</surname></persName> and drove away the <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>It was then (<dateStruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></dateStruct>) that the <rs>Austrian Netherlands</rs> were constituted the <name>Kingdom</name> of <placeName key="tgn,1000063" n="1.000 67" reg="belgie">Belgium</placeName>, and <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>Leopold</foreName></persName> of Saxe Coburg (widower of <persName><roleName n="Princess">the Princess</roleName> <foreName>Charlotte</foreName></persName>) made <persName n="King,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00147" reg="mostcommon:King,nomatch:0"><surname>King</surname></persName> under the joint protection of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/><persName n="Leopold,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00148" reg="mostcommon:Leopold,nomatch:0"><surname>Leopold</surname></persName> subsequently married <persName n="Philippe,IsFather,Louis,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00149" reg="default:Philippe,Louis,,,"><roleName n="IsFather">a daughter of</roleName> <foreName>Louis</foreName> <surname>Philippe</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>Yet, though this circumstance is not calculated to endear him to the present ruler of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName>, the <rs>French</rs> tendencies of the population must be supposed to have a certain influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>Besides, in addition to his being a widower of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, he is the uncle of <persName n="Victoria,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00150" reg="mostcommon:Victoria,nomatch:0"><surname>Victoria</surname></persName>, who just now is the firm ally of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00151" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/> The peculiar relation, therefore, of <placeName key="tgn,1000063" n="1.000 67" reg="belgie">Belgium</placeName> to both <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> would seem to countenance the belief that she had been used as the cat's paw, to draw this Chemult out of the fire, if there had been any truth in the rumor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>But although it is added that <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, too, has recognised us, we are still incredulous, and still believe that it is a device of the enemy to throw us off our guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>The last mentioned rumor has no other foundation, so far as we can learn, than the arrival of <persName n="Fearn,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00152" reg="mostcommon:Fearn,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Fearn</surname></persName>, who, if he has brought any such news, has communicated it to nobody outside of Government circles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>In the meantime we can see no reason for recognition just at this moment which did not exist <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> ago. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/> Let us again warn our countrymen not to indulge in any day dreams on account of these rumors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>Let them not relex the stern purpose of their souls to fight out the war to the last extremity, and to rely on nobody but themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>To the <rs>Government</rs> we are <unclear>assured</unclear> it would be supererogatory to address any such caution, because they are in a situation to know the truth or the <unclear>trary</unclear> of all the reports which swarm through the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>We must all nerve our souls to an effort such as we have not yet made, gigantic as have been those of the year which is fast fleeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>The reports of intervention discussion among the enemy, failure of their currency to answer its purposes, and all kindred reports, are, we sincerely believe, but delusions, which, if indulged in to any extent, will prove most baneful to the great <unclear></unclear> in which we are engaged. </p> </div3>
