<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> --A correspondent of the <rs>Selma</rs> <hi rend="italics">Reporter</hi> relates a story which should serve as a solemn warning to the wives of soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>He says a few weeks ago a soldier was tried and convicted of the crime of desertion, and sentenced to be shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The day for the execution arrived, and at the appointed hour this brave man, who had fought many battles and endured every kind of hardship, fell a bloody corpse at the hands of his comrades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Upon inquiry it was ascertained he was as true as steel to our cause, and that it was on account of his wife that he deserted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>He received a letter from her full of complaints.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Looking alone upon the dark side of the picture, she had magnified her troubles and sufferings, and earnestly entreated her husband to return home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>He became restless, discontented, unhappy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>He ceased to make any interest in the discharge of his military duties, and thought only of how he could get home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>His solemn oath never to desert troubled him much, and he well knew the crime of desertion had become so frequent in the army it would be punished with death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>In this state of perplexity he drew his wife's letter from his bosom and read it again, and, shutting his eyes to the consequences, in <hi rend="italics">deserted?</hi> and for this crime he suffered a bloody and ignominious death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>His wife, now a widow, known no peace of mind, but is constantly haunted with the thought that her exaggerated representations of her trials and sufferings caused her husband's death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Let this case be a lesson to all wives and mothers.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Congress hat, by <num value="1">one</num> dash, made an absolute monarch of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00153" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>It has given him the entire control of the purse and the sword.--those instruments of absolute power which it has ever been the unceasing policy of all <rs n="Anglo-Saxon" type="group">Anglo Saxon</rs> peoples to keep separated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>The hand that grass both the purse and the sword is the hand of an absolute, irresponsible monarch, and written Constitutions and paper guarantees, laws and legislatures, are more toys in his sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>For the sake of destroying the people of the <rs>South</rs> the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Congress has tamely surrendered every barrier against Executive encroachment, every bulwark of liberty, every safeguard even of person or property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00154" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> is undisputed master of everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>It remains with him to say whether he will permit any more legislation, whether he will go out at the end of his term, whether another Congress shall ever assemble; or, if he should determine to permit it to assemble, whether it shall be anything more than a convenient machine for registering his edicts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have been living under a virtual despotism for <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>.--The present system is not merely an actual despotism; it is such in name, as well as fact. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/> Every men between the ages of <num value="18">18</num> and <num value="45">45</num> is placed at the disposal of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00155" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> for military service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>He had has power, not only to keep in the ranks the <num value="300000">300,000</num> who, it was fondly hoped, would go out in <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> that he may add thereto <num value="3000000">3,000,000</num> if he see fit. The illusion with regard to the power of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government to sustain the strain upon their finances is dissipated by a breath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>The Congress has annihilated the <rs>State</rs> banks at allow, and made &#x0022;green backs&#x0022; the only currency within <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00156" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s dominions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>So <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00157" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> can have as many soldiers as he may wish, and pay them, too. Another illusion still exists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>It is supposed that those who are out of the field at present will refuse to go, and that those who are in it already will revolt in a body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>This is all folly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>If men at home refused to go, they will be compelled to do it at the point of the bayonet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>If men already in the field refuse to serve any longer, they, too, will be compelled, unless the whole body lay down their arms at <num value="1">one</num> movement, or turn them against their officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>This is a thing unheard of in war. Suppose these men all revolt, how are they to be fed?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>How are they to get away?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>Where is the money for their necessities to come from?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>It is folly to make any such calculation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>There may be desertions on an enormous scale; but the bulk of the army will remain. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/> Let us, therefore, dismiss all the idle hopes which we may have been induced to entertain by the knowledge that a large body of the enemy's forces go out of service in <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>Those troops will stay voluntarily if they choose it, by force if they oppose it. So far from being diminished, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> force is about to be prodigiously increased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>We must meet it, and we must beat it. That can be done only by pushing the conscription to its utmost limit, and thereby by preserving the proportion we have always borne to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>There is no the slightest ground for discouragement in all this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>They have always been vastly superior to us in numbers and they have uniformly been beaten upon every field of importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>Even now with the largest army that has taken the field since the time of <persName n="Xerxes,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00158" reg="mostcommon:Xerxes,nomatch:0"><surname>Xerxes</surname></persName>, they have shown themselves unable throughout the winter, the season most propitious to them from their enormous superiority on the water to make the slightest impression upon us if with <num value="850000">850,000</num> men they had themselves <unclear></unclear> incompetent to make the least advance, what can they effect by doubting or trebling their numbers?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>It is not men that they want.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>They have a numerical force sufficient to conquer the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>It is the heart, the soul, the spirit that is wanting &mdash; that leaven which leavens the whole lump &mdash; that principle without which an army, be it as large as it may, is a more carcass &mdash; a body devoid of life, and fit only to be the sport of its enemies.--<num value="3000000">Three millions</num> of men must necessarily be a mob. It is not in the power of man to reduce such a multitude to anything resembling the shape of a well trained army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>Such mobs never have made, and never will make, conquests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>It has been by much smaller bands of hardy, resolute, well disciplined men, that great leaders, in all ages, have effected the subjugation of nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/><persName n="Alexander,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00159" reg="mostcommon:Alexander,nomatch:0"><surname>Alexander</surname></persName> invaded the <rs>East</rs> with <num value="35000">35,000</num> men. <persName n="Caesar,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00160" reg="mostcommon:Caesar,nomatch:0"><surname>Caesar</surname></persName> subdued Giant with <num value="4">four</num> legions &mdash; about <num value="25000">25,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/><persName n="Bonaparte,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00161" reg="mostcommon:Bonaparte,nomatch:0"><surname>Bonaparte</surname></persName> overran and conquered <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName> with but <num value="30000">30,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>But <num value="1">one</num> man of modern times has lived who could handle <num value="500000">500,000</num> men. The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have not <num value="1">one</num> General that can handle the <num value="20" type="ordinal">twentieth</num> part of that number, and unless troops be well handled numbers are of no avail. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/> Let us, then, make up our minds to meet these huge mobs without any doubts as to the result. --They will but stand in the way of each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>They will but render order and discipline &mdash; hard enough now to enforce in their armies &mdash; absolutely impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>Let it be remembered that we cannot and must not give up. To do so were to abandon everything, for these blood-thirsty wretches avow a determination to extinguish the inhabitants and to possess the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>Our own opinion is that they will only make our victory the more glorious by the enormous numbers they bring to render it impossible. </p> </div3>
