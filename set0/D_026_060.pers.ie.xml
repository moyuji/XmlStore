<head rend="italics">The <unclear>Foll</unclear> of Secession from the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> A <unclear></unclear> who have been afflicted as you have been afflicted; a people who suffer as you suffer; a people whose gallant boys have been slaughtered as your sons have fallen on the battle field; whose darlings now languish in Northern prisons; wives whose husbands are wasting in far distant camps weary months of listless inactivity, while the weeds choke the scanty harvest, and the children pine for the presence and support of their natural protector; old men, who in fever anxiety await intelligence which each succeeding mail may bring of the slaughter of the pride and support of their declining years &mdash; all are liable to reach out, with the spirit of a drowning man, to grasp any passing straw, which for the moment may keep their heads above the roaring flood, losing sight meanwhile of the firm, though perhaps distant shore which calm, determined and persistent effort will assuredly enable them to attain. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> In consequence of this continued suffering which experience had not prepared the people to endure with the fortitude possessed by some nations who have been nurtured to the shock of arms, a certain discontent has pervaded and a funeral a gloom hung over the community, engendering, if we credit a wide rumor throughout the <rs>State</rs>, a notion that we must have Convention that we must secede from the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>; that we must repudiate the whole <unclear></unclear> and go back and do our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> work over again. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> Now permit me to ask you what it was that got you into this scape?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Why, you all know that it was the fact of your secession in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>[Applause.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> <unclear>Suppose</unclear> you were sick of typhoid fever, and had been close to death's door; and, becoming convalescent, the physician should gravely inform you that the only plan to effect your entire recovery would be to take another spell of the informal fever?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Would you not think he was a fool?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>[Laughter.] Or suppose a surgeon should say to a soldier with a ball in his leg: &#x0022;My dear fellow, I don't see how it is possible for you to obtain relief unless I call for a musket and put another <num value="1">one</num> in the other leg.&#x0022; That would be curious surgery, would it not?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Would a system bated on the same principle be less absurd when applied to the healing of the body politic? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> Secession was tried after it had been considered for a period of <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure>, and the whole country understood it as completely as an abstraction could be understood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>We were promised it should be peaceable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>What is the result?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Why it has been everything else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>It has involved us in a war us, <unclear></unclear> has no parallel upon the pages of history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Do you expect to find a remedy by a repetition of the dose that brought you to bed? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> Our destinies, fellow citizens, have now been cast in another Government; and although, as you all know, I regretted to go out of the former Government, and was <num value="1">one</num> of the last to lay it down, and did lay it down with the same mournful feelings with which I followed my dear father to the grave, I never expected, and do not now expect, to see it resurrected again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Our Convention, composed of delegates fresh from the people, by the most solemnities that can bind an honorable people to a cause, have pledged their all to its support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/><dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct> <name n="God" type="God">God</name> aid us in the fulfilment of this obligation in the future as in the past, to the letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The act was a deliberate expression of public sentiment &mdash; though it may have been wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The Government we selected is ours, as much so as are our own children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The spirit of patriotism is akin to the love of our offspring, which <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has implanted in us &mdash; the highest, holiest sentiment of humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>A man should love his home if for nothing else but because it is his and shelters him; he should love his wife if for no other reason than because she is his wife; he should love his State because it is his &mdash; a part, as it were, of his being, he should love his country, right or wrong &mdash; when in the midst of clashing events he cannot take time to examine all aspects of the question &mdash; because in its destiny are involved the welfare of State, community, home, wife, children, self.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>But if you have no other reason to give for defending it, say you do so because it is <hi rend="italics">your</hi> country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> Now, gentlemen, I desire to present to you all the various aspects of this question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>You have placed me in a position that enables me to gather from sources of information beyond the reach of the public generally, facts which are necessary to a solution of the difficulties and problems which agitate your minds; and if you will only have charity enough to believe that I am honest in what I say, possibly you may, on retiring, be able to quote the passage of Scripture: &#x0022;it was good for me to be here.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> Now, what is it you desire above all other present earthly good?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>[Voices--&#x0022;peace, &#x0022; &#x0022;peace,&#x0022; &#x0022;we all want peace.&#x0022;] I know you do. Everybody wants peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Peace, blessed peace!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Why, the man who does not desire peace is unworthy of existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Peace! It is <num value="1">one</num> of the highest and holiest attributes of Deity, so much so, that our blessed Saviour, <persName n="Christ,,Jesus,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="default:Christ,Jesus,,,"><foreName>Jesus</foreName> <surname>Christ</surname></persName>, was called the <rs>Prince</rs> of Peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The great Apostle <persName n="Paul,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Paul,nomatch:0"><surname>Paul</surname></persName> said of the highest character of peace, the peace of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> that &#x0022;it <unclear>pass</unclear> all understanding.&#x0022; Now, if you really want peace his great blessing to repose upon our bleeding country, your sons to return from the battle field and take their position again in the family circle, commerce and agriculture to resume their beneficent away, the sword beaten into the plowshare and industry again to stretch her <unclear></unclear> wand over the was beaten fields till they bloom as a garden I suppose, at reasonable men, you are writing to take the best plan to obtain this consummation so devoutly wished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Which is the best plan? </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="2"> 
<head rend="italics">A Convention &mdash; its Purposes and Results &mdash; the position of a neutral State.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> A Convention is proposed by some.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>I have no denunciation to make to those who are moving this question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>They are as sound men, no doubt, as I am &mdash; as you are &mdash; as anybody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>They are my friends; but I think it is wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Suppose you call a Convention without any design it shall put the <rs>State</rs> out of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>You merely call it with the hope that it may be able to make some proposition for peace, or accomplish some result in the direction of peace, that the <name>Legislature</name> or the <rs>Executive</rs> are unable to bring about.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Suppose you call a Convention for this purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>You elect your delegates, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing they do on taking their scars is to swear, on the <rs>Holy Evangelists</rs>, to support the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Now, having done that, we take it for granted that they, as honorable men, will keep that oath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>What does that Constitution say?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Why, in article <num value="1">1</num>, section <num value="9">9</num>, it reads as follows: &#x0022;No State shall enter into any treaty, alliance or confederation.&#x0022; And in article <num value="2">2</num>, section <num value="11">11</num>, it says: <q>&#x0022;<placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> shall have power by and with the advice and consent of the <name>Senate</name>, to make treaties, provided <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of the <name>Senate</name> concur.&#x0022;</q> Now you see that the <rs>Constitution</rs> your delegates have sworn to support, expressly provides that the power to declare war and to make peace shall be vested in the <rs>President</rs> and Senate of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>; and the moment <num value="1">one</num> of your delegates makes a proposition or proffers a treaty of any kind to the enemies of his country, he is a traitor by the law and has foresworn himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>[Applause.] That is so, not because I say it, but because it is written in the <rs>Constitution</rs> we have all agreed to support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>If you do not intend to instruct your delegates to take your State out of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, you see from this aspect of the question, your Convention assembled can do nothing more towards realizing the end in view than your Legislature or your Governor can accomplish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>It can't turn a wheel. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> Well, suppose you go a little further and say you will instruct your delegates to take the <rs>State</rs> out of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, because when it is out it is relieved from the obligation of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and rests upon a separate and independent basic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Supporting also, that it is not your design to join the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States Government</orgName> again, but only to go out as an independent sovereignty, for the purpose of securing peace to yourself, and possibly effecting the same desirable end for all </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> parties. Well, you pass an ordinance of secession &mdash; take another dose of this political <persName n="Morehouse,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Morehouse,nomatch:0"><surname>Morehouse</surname></persName> tea &mdash; and nothing I know of is more bitter unless it is a boneset decoction-- [laughter]--and set up for yourselves.--Is that going to give you peace?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Will that restore your sons and fathers to their homes?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Will that hush the cry of the orphan and dry the widow's tears?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Will that fill your land with plenty and prosperity?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>So far from it, I can assure you, my fellow citizens, it will involve you in a new war, a bloodier conflict than that you now deplore. &#x0022;But,&#x0022; you may say, <q>&#x0022;<persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Charles,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> and his Government will not dare to make war on a seceding State, because the right of secession is recognized in the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.&#x0022;</q> So it is, my friends; but you see by that time you have thrown off that Constitution, you have gotten from under its obligations and sworn you would have nothing to do with it. Do you expect the <rs>Confederacy</rs> to be bound by a document you refuse to recognize as effecting yourselves?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>So soon as you announce to the world you are a sovereign and independent nation, as a matter of course the <rs>Confederacy</rs> has the right of declaring war against you for sufficient cause, equally with the right she holds of declaring war against <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, or <placeName reg="Nederland" key="tgn,7016845">Holland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>This right is inherent in all sovereignties. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/> But what would <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Abraham</foreName></persName> say to it &mdash; that old gentleman whose personal pulchritude has been the subject of so much remark?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>[laughter,] and who, they say, can tell more bad jokes than I can. [Laughter.] How would be receive the intelligence that <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> had seceded from the <rs>Confederacy</rs> and set up for herself?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>He would put his thumb up to his nose and make certain gyrations and evolutions with his finger, and say, &#x0022;Wall, ole <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>I'm tarnation glad <unclear></unclear> see yer come outer <placeName reg="Jeff Davis, Noxubee, Mississippi" key="tgn,2420078">Jeff Davis</placeName>'s little consarn, I <unclear> </unclear>; but yer don't mean for to say yer sia't in the <rs>Union</rs> agin, and under the protection of the best gov't the world ever saw. Bin fitin yer too long to let you sneak out that way&#x0022; [Continued laughter and applauce]--Why, of course, if such aproceeding on the part of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> would secure her independence, it would only be necessary for <num value="1">one</num> State to secede at a time, to get herself acknowledged, and after all were out, turn round and form such a Confederacy as best pleased them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Old Abraham is fighting us not because we are a part of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, but because we are in rebellion to the Old Union, and so long as we refused obedience to him he would continue to fight us. The idea that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> would recognize us or abate his claim to allegiance and obedience, is preposterous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Well, would the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> recognize your independence and make a treaty of peace with you?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>This is entirely owing to contingencies.
