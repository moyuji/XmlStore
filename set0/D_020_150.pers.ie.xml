<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/> <num value="1">One</num> important fact which ought never to be lost sight of in this controversy is that the <rs>Southern</rs> people and statesmen are extremely anxious to be on friendly political and commercial relations with this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>They want our manufactured goods in exchange for their cotton and tobacco.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/> The idea of procuring from other places enough of cotton to save us from the impending disaster is simply fatuous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>Taking the <num value="2">two</num> elements of quantity and quality into account, it is safe to assert that not from any or all ports of the world can we find an equivalent for the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> cotton of which we are now deprived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>As for the <placeName reg="East Indies" key="tgn,6001831">East Indies</placeName>--the region from which the most sanguine expectations are now cherished &mdash; nothing but the grossest ignorance could have given birth to the delusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>That it is a delusion to believe that now, or for years yet, a sufficient supply of cotton can be procured from that country to render us independent of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> everybody who has looked into the matter must admit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>To grow enough cotton in <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName>, and to provide the ways and means by which it can be transported to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 5" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> at such terms as will induce manufacturers to purchase it, cannot, on the most moderate computation, be accomplished in less than <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>The reason is obvious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/><placeName reg="East Indies" key="tgn,6001831">East India</placeName> cotton is both coarser and shorter in fibre than the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>To adapt this machinery to the <placeName reg="East Indies" key="tgn,6001831">East India</placeName> cotton would necessitate a complete revolution and reconstruction of our machinery. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/> Once more, then, we call upon our country; aye, and upon our country women, to take instant and energetic action in this matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>But, to the working classes in an especial and emphatic manner, we address our appeal.--Why should they see their wives in rags, their children famishing, their cupboards empty, their grates fireless, their homes denuded or every article of furniture, themselves pressed into pauperism or coerced into crime, because the mad and mean government of the <rs>Northern States</rs> has committed itself to <num value="1">one</num> of the most foolish and wicked wars ever waged by <num value="1">one</num> power against another ? Were they to be guilty of such complicity in their own extinction, the verdict of the rest of the world would be, that their cowardice was only equaled by their criminality, so that a set of more unmitigated imbeciles never walked or crawled upon the face of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>It is, therefore, the most sacred and bounden duty of the working classes, and, indeed, of all classes &mdash; but of the former in a precipitant degree &mdash; to take up this question and make use of all the constitutional mockery at their disposal, in order to induce the <rs>British</rs> government to interpose its power for the preservation of our commerce from ruin, and our citizens from starvation. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/> <hi rend="italics">Editors Dispatch;</hi> No doubt you have been inundated with letters from this camp, filled with incidents of the late battle, and praises to the favorites of the writers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>These laudations are well understood and properly appreciated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>But justice demands the correction of an erroneous impression which some have most industriously sought to spread.--It has been repeatedly stated that the <orgName type="regiment" key="31VARegiment">31st Virginia regiment</orgName> suffered most severely in the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>Absolutely, this may be true; relatively, it is certainly untrue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>Now, on the right, where the battle was fiercest and longest, the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 31">31st regiment</orgName> and <orgName n="battalion"><persName n="Hansbrough,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00230" reg="mostcommon:Hansbrough,nomatch:0"><surname>Hansbrough</surname></persName>'s battalion</orgName>, and some of <persName n="Reger,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00231" reg="mostcommon:Reger,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Maj.</roleName> <surname>Reger</surname></persName>'s men, were commingled indiscriminately, fighting shoulder to shoulder. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/> Of the regiment, there were certainly over <num value="300">300</num> men in the fight, whilst of the battalion there were scarcely <num value="100">100</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>You publish the loss of the former, in killed and wounded, to be <num value="42">42</num>, and that of the latter to be <num value="28">28</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>Of the <num value="42">forty-two</num>, <num value="9">nine</num> we killed; of the <num value="28">twenty-eight</num>, <num value="6">six</num> were killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>The battalion lost <persName n="Mollohan,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00232" reg="mostcommon:Mollohan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Mollohan</surname></persName>, the noblest looking officer I ever beheld.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>The galla of <persName n="Haymond,,Luther,D.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00233" reg="default:Haymond,Luther,D.,,"><foreName>Luther</foreName> <foreName>D.</foreName> <surname>Haymond</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</rs> of <orgName n="Molionan's Company"><persName n="Molionan,Company,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00234" reg="mostcommon:Molionan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Company"></roleName><surname>Molionan</surname></persName>'s company</orgName>, lost his right arm. Several others were severely wounded <persName n="Hansbrough,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00235" reg="mostcommon:Hansbrough,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Hansbrough</surname></persName> himself was wounded severely in the thickest of the fight, urging and leading on the men around him, many of whom were <num value="31" type="ordinal">31st</num> and <persName n="Reger,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00236" reg="mostcommon:Reger,nomatch:0"><surname>Reger</surname></persName>'s men; the writer belonging to the latter class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>He exhibited throughout an enthusiasm highly contagious, and a courage <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> to no man's. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/> He has picked up a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> musket, which I loaded for him more than once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>I was near him when he was shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>He placed his hand on his thigh where the bullet entered, and then staggered and fell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>I heard him exclaim, <q>&#x0022;they have hit me, but I'll give them <num value="1">one</num> round more&#x0022;</q> Sulting the action to the word, he drew up to a log and fired his musket and several barrels of his navy revolver with deliberate him. He continued to urge on his men till <persName n="Robinson,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00237" reg="nearbymention:Robinson,Sidney,,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut.</roleName> <surname>Robinson</surname></persName> and another bore him off the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>This was about <time value="11oclock">11 o'clock</time>, and the enemy were then recoiling before our incessant fire and deadly aim. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/> It is just, also, to say that the battle was commenced by this Battalion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>As soon as his scouts announced the approach of the enemy through the woods, on our right, <persName n="Hansbrough,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00238" reg="mostcommon:Hansbrough,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Hansbrough</surname></persName> led his battalion to meet them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>He got within <measure n="125yards" type="distance">125 yards</measure> of the enemy and gave them a deadly volley.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>The <num value="31" type="ordinal">31st</num> and <persName n="Reger,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00239" reg="mostcommon:Reger,nomatch:0"><surname>Reger</surname></persName>'s men, were <measure n="400yards" type="distance">400 yards distant</measure>, and out of sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>The battalion fell back and met the <num value="31" type="ordinal">31st</num>, which was gallantly advancing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>As it fell back, the enemy poured upon it a shower of <persName><foreName>Minnie</foreName></persName> balls. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/> The enemy at this point were <num value="1500">1,500</num> strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>Then it was that the <num value="31" type="ordinal">31st</num> and this battalion advanced to the charge and became commingled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>Both corps acted as bravely as men could act, though they evinced but little discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/><persName n="Hansbrough,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00240" reg="mostcommon:Hansbrough,nomatch:0"><surname>Hansbrough</surname></persName>'s men, as well as the <num value="31" type="ordinal">31st</num>, are all Northwestern Virginias.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>These are facts well known in camp, and it appears strange, letter writers and others should be so utterly forgetful of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>I believe the enemy's loss in killed and wounded to have been at least <num value="500">500</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>Their absurdly false account of the result is rather a confirmation of our statement.
