<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>It was seen by our pickets a few miles from the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> A remarkable phenomenon was witnessed a few miles west of this place, at the house of <persName n="Pearey,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Pearey,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Pearey</surname></persName>, on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day of this month, at about <time value="3pm">3 o'clock P.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> The weather was quite hot and dry, not a cloud could be seen, no wind even ruffled the foliage on the surrounding trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>All things being propitious, the grand panorama began to move.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Just over and through the tops of the trees on the adjacent hills on the <rs>South</rs>, immense numbers of rolls resembling cotton or smoke, apparently of the size and shape of doors, seemed to be passing rapidly through the air, yet in beautiful order and regularity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The rolls seemed to be tinged on the edge with light green, so as to resemble a border or deep fringe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>There were apparently <num value="1000">thousands</num> of them, and were, perhaps, an hour in getting by Alter these had passed over and out of sight the scene was changed from the air above to the earth beneath, and became more intensely interesting to the spectators who were witnessing the panorama from different stand-points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>In the deep valley beneath, <num value="1000">thousands</num> upon <num value="1000">thousands</num> of (apparently) human beings (men) came in view traveling in the same direction of the rolls, marching in good order, some <num value="30">thirty</num> or <num value="40">forty</num> in depth, moving rapidly--&#x0026;double-quick&#x0026;--and commenced ascending the sides of the almost insurmountable hills opposite, and had the stoop peculiar to men when they ascend a steep mountain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>There seemed to be great variety in the size of the men, some were very large whilst others were quite small.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Their arms, legs, and heads could be distinctly seen in motion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>They seemed to observe strict military discipline, and there were no strugglers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> There was uniformity of dress, loose white blouses or shirts, with white pants, wore hats, and were without guns, swords, or anything that indicated &#x0026;men of war.&#x0026; On they came through the valley and over the steep hill crossing the road, and finally passing out of sight, in a direction due north from those who were looking on. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/> --All the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> papers which we receive are filled with braggadocio &mdash; speaking, always, of the crushing out of the rebellion, as though it were already an accomplished fact, and constantly threatening <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Espana" key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName>, with the vengeance of the all-powerful <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>If we look a little below the surface, however, it is not difficult to discover that this is all talk and nothing else, designed to delude the multitude and encourage them to persevere in the prosecution of this war. The signs of exhaustion are so palpable that they cannot be mistaken by the least experienced eye. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/> In the first place, the <orgName n="New York World" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">World</hi></orgName> tells us, what we had previously heard from a source entitled to credit, that the draft has proved a complete failure, not having secured the services of <num value="60000">60,000</num> men, all told, throughout the whole <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>Now these <num value="60000">60,000</num> men will go but a very short way to fill up the gap made in the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> ranks by the campaign of <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, at <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName>, at <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName>, at <placeName reg="Chickamauga, Walker, Georgia" key="tgn,7013598">Chickamauga</placeName>, at <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, and by sickness and desertion which have prevailed to a most unusual extent throughout the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> armies every-where. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/> Secondly, the <orgName n="New York Times" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName>, a short time since, in the course of an editorial designed to spur up the flagging energies of its Government, stated that the greater part of its army would go out of service next <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>; that the winter and the mud would prove most powerful auxiliaries to our troops, as they did last year and the year before; that the rebellion must, therefore, be crushed before <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct>, and that if not crushed before that time it could not be until next fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>It stated that the only troops it would have on hand for the grand crushing operation next <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>--the earliest day at which it would be possible to open the campaign &mdash; would be the new conscripts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>It rated their strength at <num value="300000">three hundred thousand</num>, but the estimate of the <hi rend="italics">World,</hi> we have reason to know, is much nearer the mark. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/> Thirdly. In commenting upon the failure of <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00125" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName>'s <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> campaign, the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName> revealed the fact that it was undertaken for the purpose of seizing several <measure n="100000barrels" type="mass">hundred thousand bales</measure> of cotton known to exist in that State, which it deemed essential to support the credit of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> finances.--This is a most important revelation.--It was hoped by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> that this cotton would be sold, in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> for specie, and that, by means of the money thus acquired, the credit of their Government would be sustained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>But the enterprise has failed and the relief is not afforded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>The indebtedness of Yankeedom to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> certainly does not fall short of <num value="1000">one thousand</num> <num value="1000000">million</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/><placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> is growing impatient, and must have principal or interest in specie.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/><rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> dom, its piratical inroad into <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> having failed, can pay neither principal not interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>There are lively hopes of a general crash, and when her financial bubble shall have exploded, what is Yankeedom to do.? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/> <num value="4" type="ordinal">Fourth</num> and lastly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>In order to reinforce <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00126" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName>, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are compelled to take heavy detachments from the <orgName>army of <persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00127" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><surname>Meade</surname></persName></orgName> at the very time when that officer is expected to make a fresh &#x0022;on to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>,&#x0022; and when, according to the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName>, there can be no doubt of his success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>If the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have the overwhelming force of which they boast, why is it necessary to deplete <num value="1">one</num> army in order to strengthen another?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>In order to reinforce <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00128" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName>, also, they are stripping the whole lower country of troops, thereby exposing it to reoccupation by our troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>Why all this, if they have the hosts they pretend to have?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>The fact is their mighty armies are, for the most part, &#x0022;men in buckram.&#x0022; They exist nowhere but in the imagination of <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00129" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> and their editors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>Their <hi rend="italics">real</hi> strength is not greatly superior to ours. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/> Our people, when they feel a disposition to despond, should think on these things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>They should reflect that if they are <hi rend="italics">straitened</hi>, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are <unclear></unclear> They should observe that they <unclear></unclear> strengthen <num value="1">one</num> army without </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/> weakening another, or overrun <num value="1">one</num> part of the country without abandoning its equivalent somewhere else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>When the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <rs type="role" reg="Cabinet">Cabinet</rs> of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00130" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> exploded, a caricature was published well known at the time as the <rs>Rat Caricature</rs>.
