<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> The <orgName n="Richmond Enquirer" type="newspaper">Richmond <hi rend="italics">Enquirer</hi></orgName> justly remarks that the sick rolls of regiment and companies ought to be closely looked into, to see what commanders and what surgeons watch over the health of their men, providing them with such comforts, imposing upon them such restrictions, and requiring of them such observances as will promote their vigor and secure their good health.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Why is it, asks the <hi rend="italics">Enquirer,</hi> that some regiments have been almost rendered useless by sickness, while others similarly situated and with similar troops, have suffered but little?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Soldiers left to themselves will be negligent and imprudent; and if their interests are not looked after by their commanders, they will suffer from exposure and privation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>He who most excels in attention to these duties, whether medical officer or commander, is even worthier of promotion than he who distinguishes himself for gallantry and capacity in actual battle, but neglects his duties at other times, and so sends his men into the hospital and keeps them there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>A comparison of the reports of the physical condition of the various divisions and subdivisions of the army, would, by involving necessary explanations, enable our authorities to determine what officers merit applause and who deserve censure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>We trust such inquiries and comparisons will be diligently and rigidly made, and that those who may be found to deserve commendation will be suitably honored, while the negligent shall be censured, and warned or dismissed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> The <hi rend="italics">Enquirer</hi> has been shown a letter written on the authority of a physician of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, complaining in the most earnest and emphatic manner of the <orgName n="Medical Department" type="department">Medical Department</orgName> at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The <rs>Doctor</rs> says, &#x0022;the filth is revolting,&#x0022; and censures in the strongest terms the medical administration, both as respects sanitary regulations and the attention to sick soldiers at that point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The <hi rend="italics">Enquirer</hi> says it has heard much through other sources to confirm these representations, and, if half of them be true, a searching inquest and summary remedy should at once be had by the supreme authorities. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Nothing less was to be expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>It was precisely for that purpose that the brigade was organized, that <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Sickles,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Sickles,nomatch:0"><surname>Sickles</surname></persName></hi> assisted in its organization, that New York gave him her blessing, that the <rs>Government</rs> accepted him and his followers. &#x0022;Booty and Beauty&#x0022; were the watchwords deliberately adopted, and &#x0022;booty and beauty&#x0022; are thus far the order of the day. What else than such scenes of horror as are transpiring in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> could be expected of such a brigade and such a General?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>In no civilized society of Christendom could such a fellow as <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Sickles,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Sickles,nomatch:0"><surname>Sickles</surname></persName></hi> be recognized by gentlemen, and in no army on the face of the earth, except that of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, would he be permitted to hold a commission.

<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/> --We have seen it estimated that under the operation of the <name>Sequestration</name> act of the <orgName n="Confederate Congress" type="Congress">Confederate Congress</orgName>, from <num value="15000000">fifteen</num> to <num value="30000000">thirty millions</num> of dollars will purs into the custody of the <rs>Confederates</rs> receivers in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>The estimate strikes us as moderate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>It is well known that nearly all the merchants of our cities, towns, and villages, were in the habit of purchasing their stocks from the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>Even though a small portion of the merchants of the interior laid in their goods in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, still, in as much as the <rs>Richmond</rs> merchants bought the largest portion of their goods from New York, the result was the same as if the country merchants had all gone directly to that city. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/> The war came on in <dateStruct value="-04-"><month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct>, just after the season when the merchants had laid in their Spring supplies of goods from the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>Very few of these goods were purchased for cash.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>The custom of trade was to buy on credit; and nearly all these goods were bought on the neural terms of <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>Thus the war opened on an indebtedness from <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> (and doubtless the case was the same with <unclear></unclear> the <rs>Southern States</rs>) to the <rs>North</rs>, equal to the total of the spring purchases of her merchants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>This indebtedness was augmented by the whole amount of old debts of prior standing, which had resulted from a course of business that had existed for a long train of years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>From these considerations, we are inclined to put the indebtedness from <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to the <rs>North</rs> on mercantile account at a very light figure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>We do not think it can be less than <num value="20000000">twenty millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>For that portion of the <rs>State</rs> not overrun by the enemy, we suppose it to be at least <num value="15000000">fifteen millions</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>In addition to the blood being poisoned at night in the closed tents, by re-breathing the carbonic acid expelled from the lungs, it is <hi rend="italics">fired</hi> during the hot part of the day by the excessive heat within the tents themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>This excessive heat could be avoided by encamping in or near the woods, instead of the open field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>It is cooler under the shade of trees in the hot part of the day than in any kind of tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>It is warmer at night in the woods than in an open plain.--In the open field, fire-wood is troublesome to procure; whereas, in or near the woods (instead of half a mile or more from the timbered land) fires could easily be kept burning al night in front of tents, which might be left entirely open, both in front and at the sides, or nettling a free circulation of the air, and at the same time securing the requisite degree of warmth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>If these fires were built on <num value="2">two</num> logs of green wood, the logs would burn through about midnight, and the fire might be renewed and kept up all night, without adding any more wood, by bringing the extremities of the logs together which had been burnt through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>The evil of damp ground could be obviated by burning a brush heap over the ground before pitching the tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>Our intelligent and practical friend has shown us a form of constructing tents, which has all the advantages of the <name>Sibley</name> tent, without its expense and inconvenience of transportation.--It consists simply of <num value="2">two</num> sheds facing each other at some <num value="10">ten</num> or <measure n="12feet" type="distance">twelve feet</measure> apart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/> On the frontiers of our Confederacy <num value="200000">two hundred thousand</num> of our brethren, under arms, offer their generous bosoms as a barrier to the invasion that threatens us. Many have already fallen, yielded their lives for us. <num value="1000">Thousands</num>, felled by the deadly weapons of the enemies of our independence, have reddened with their blood our country's violated soil, and their mutilated forms now pine upon afflictions bed. Not only the voice of humanity, not only the great law of universal charity, but the blood of brethren appeals to us. If love of country has induced them to sacrifice even life in her service, ah!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>what should we not do for such magnanimous souls? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/> For the dead we may only offer good works and prayers to hasten their participation in the glory and felicity of a better life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>What we can do we should do. Let us imitate the admirable example left to posterity by <num value="1">one</num> of the noblest heroes of antiquity.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/> As to the dear wounded, who of us, very dear brethren, would not be honored to shelter such men, to dress those glorious wounds, to soothe such sorrows?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>What we cannot perform individually we should, at least, aid in accomplishing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>Let us give a little of our means to those who have been so prodigal of their blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>Our generosity, however great will never equal the magnanimity of which they have given proof; but let us while testifying to them our tender and lively gratitude, discharge simultaneously a religious debt. </p>
