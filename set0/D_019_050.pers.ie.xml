<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>He alluded to the magnitude of the subjects which the <rs>Convention</rs> was called to consider.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>He had listened with pain and displeasure to the discussions in this body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>He regretted that the gentleman from <placeName key="tgn,2002186" n="1.000 7" reg="rockbridge, virginia, united states">Rockbridge</placeName>, (<hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Moore,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Moore,William,T.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Moore</surname></persName>,</hi>) who was not in his seat, had not undergone a change of sentiment in <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure>, while a change had swept over the country, and he was almost ready to say, over the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/><measure n="30years" type="date">Thirty years</measure> ago, that gentleman believed that slavery was a moral, social and political evil, and he regretted the expressions that indicated similar opinions still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>He next alluded to the remarks of the gentleman from <placeName reg="Bedford, Bedford, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2086267">Bedford</placeName>, (<hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Goggin,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Goggin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Goggin</surname></persName>,</hi>) and welcomed the sentiment that when it comes to coercion, he would be found fighting under the flag of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>But they had not dwelt sufficiently upon the wrongs of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>He then gave a historical sketch of the rise and progress of the anti-slavery party, and proceeded to consider the recent acts of the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republicans</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>He thought there was no chance of effecting any change in public sentiment at the <rs>North</rs>.--<persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> was elected upon a single principle of hostility to the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Under the distribution of the official patronage, how long would it be before a man might come to think the wrong the better side?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>If we stay together for <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure>, he thought there would be most beneficent showers of patronage upon <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>--he would not go so far as <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>--and upon <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Those who accepted the gifts would form a nucleus of acquiescence in the powers that be, and in the next election, or the next but <num value="1">one</num>, we should have <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> orators on every stump, and where would <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>'s safety be? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>There might be those who thought he was for throwing away the treasure of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>He would tell them that in the last election he voted for <persName n="Bell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Bell,Jonathan,,,:1"><surname>Bell</surname></persName> and <persName n="Everett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Everett,nomatch:0"><surname>Everett</surname></persName>, but did so upon the declaration that if the <orgName n="Charleston Convention" type="convention">Charleston Convention</orgName> had made a nomination he would have supported it. But that failed, and he had thought that the conservative portion of the people might rally to save the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>In this he was disappointed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>For years he had endeavored to drive back the wave of Northern fanaticism, and to save the <rs>Union</rs>--and in connection herewith he read from <num value="1">one</num> of his speeches in Congress, wherein he appealed for justice in behalf of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>He read it to show that his heart had been in this Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>He would do what he could to preserve it, if he could do so upon terms of honor and safety. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> But we must have security.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>He did not mean such security as was offered in the miserable abortion of the <orgName n="Peace Congress" type="congress">Peace Congress</orgName>, but permanent security; and if we could not get it, he hoped to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> the <rs>Union</rs> would be dissolved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>That was the sentiment of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The agitation of <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slavery was an ulcer, eating away the vitals of the country, and unless we used the knife or the caustic, rooted out the evil, and settled the question forever, it would result in utter ruin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The agitation must be stopped and stopped forever. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> Turning to <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Wise,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Wise,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName>,</hi> he expressed his utmost approbation of his course in repelling the invaders of the soil of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Speaking of the visit of the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> and <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> Commissioners, after that occasion, and the disappointment of their hopes, he said <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> had subsequently determined to take the matter in her own hands, and yet she was blamed for not seeking the counsel of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>He besought the gentleman from <placeName key="tgn,2002186" n="1.000 7" reg="rockbridge, virginia, united states">Rockbridge</placeName>, and the gentleman from <placeName key="tgn,2002186" n="1.000 7" reg="rockbridge, virginia, united states">Rockbridge</placeName>, and the gentleman from <placeName reg="Bedford, Bedford, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2086267">Bedford</placeName>, not to blame <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> and <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, but to blame <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>If she had gone into counsel with them when they did seek it, the present calamities would have been averted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>But she refused it, and then the crisis came on. <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> had done her part towards saving the <rs>Union</rs>, and if <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> had done as much &mdash; had been as sensitive of her wrongs &mdash; this Convention would not have been deliberating to-day upon measures to save the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>He proceeded to pay further compliments to <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> and the gallantry of her people, and vindicated them from the charge of want of proper respect and courtesy to the <rs>Virginia Commissioner</rs>, (<persName n="Robertson,Judge,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Robertson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Robertson</surname></persName>.) </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> He presumed that by this time the <rs>Convention</rs> was satisfied that he thought the proper course was for <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> to secede forthwith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>If there was any doubt upon that subject, he would read some resolutions offered by himself in the county of <placeName reg="Orange, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002177">Orange</placeName>, on the <num value="24" type="ordinal">24th</num> of <date value="1860-11">Dec., 1860.</date> The resolutions took the ground that the <rs>Union</rs> of the <rs>South</rs> is the safety of the <rs>South</rs>, and that <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> ought to go out with her Southern sisters before the <dateStruct value="-03-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>He thought if that advice had been followed, we should not now have heard <num value="1">one</num> word about coercion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Whilst wrongs and insults had been heaped upon <placeName reg="Pah Rah Range, Washoe, Nevada" key="tgn,2565143">Virginia mountains</placeName> high, she was still here deliberating whether she should go <name>North</name> or <name>South</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>He would have had a conference of the <num value="15">fifteen</num> slave States, from which he would not have excluded all the free States, but would have admitted some of the border States, whose interests at least would have been with the <rs>South</rs>; but if they could not have been purified by the association, he would have relinquished them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Such a consultation would have led to a result calculated to secure the peace of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>[Sensation.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> He went on to consider the question, what shall <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>He had with pleasure heard the gentleman from <placeName reg="Bedford, Bedford, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2086267">Bedford</placeName> (<persName n="Goggin,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Goggin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Goggin</surname></persName>) say that in the final event of a separation he would wrap himself in the folds of the flag of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, and perish with her, if she must perish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>But his idea of a Middle Confederacy, he considered nothing less than a middle foolery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>On this subject the speaker dilated at considerable length.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Speaking of the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the <rs>Provisional Government</rs>, and <persName n="Goggin,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Goggin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Goggin</surname></persName>'s expressed caution in respect to it, he said he knew his friend did not intentionally misrepresent it, but he was surprised that he should have ventured upon the subject without more thorough information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>He then read the clause in reference to the inter-State slave trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>He was surprised that gentlemen should have endeavored to create an excitement because the <orgName n="Southern States Congress" type="congress">Congress of the Southern States</orgName> ventured to reserve the right to interdict it.--He would say, that while they opposed the <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slave trade, they should remember that if <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> refused to unite her destinies with them, the seceded States would be as foreign to her as <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>If it were left to him, and <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> refused to go with the <rs>South</rs>, he would erect a breakwater, and she should keep her negroes &mdash; they should multiply on her hands &mdash; until she felt enough interested in the institution to defend it. He reiterated the assurance of the <rs>Southern Commissioners</rs> that the <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slave trade would not be reopened. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/> He had mingled much with the people of the <rs>South</rs>, and no people were possessed of <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> higher moral integrity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>He had never seen there a single <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs>, although they were imported by cargoes to the coast of <placeName reg="Cuba, Cuba, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005380">Cuba</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>If the business had ever been carried on in the <rs>Southern States</rs>, it was done on a far greater scale by the smuggling <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> of the <rs>North</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/> With regard to the difficulty of transit alluded to, in case <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> went with the <rs>South</rs>, he believed that <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName> and the <rs>Rip Raps</rs> would belong to <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>He would rally under the lead of the gentleman near him (<persName n="Wise,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Wise,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName>,) and pluck the plume from the brow of the <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant General</rs>.--He anticipated none of the difficulties spoken of by others. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/> He again urged the necessity of secession.--Where were the interests of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> in a Northern Confederacy, when for <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> they had been warring upon her and her institutions?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>If he were to agree to a union with the <rs>North</rs>, he would consider himself base enough to bend the knee to his oppressor, to bow his neck to the yoke, to extend his hands for the manacles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>He believed in secession as a measure of peace; but if war must come, he would rather have <num value="4000000">four millions</num> of slaves and <num value="8000000">eight millions</num> of freemen, than <num value="16000000">sixteen millions</num> of freemen and not a single slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>He did not conceive that under surrounding circumstances, the ideas advanced from the other side could alarm the women or the men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/> On some future occasion he proposed to show that it would be to the material interest of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> to go with the <rs>South</rs>.--All the great interests would be promoted by it. In <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure>, <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> would reap more material advantages than she would in <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> in the <rs>Union</rs>, while <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> would become a rival of New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>In conclusion, he thanked the <rs>Convention</rs> for the patience with which he had been listened to. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>He said he was glad that almost every gentleman who had spoken had disclaimed party politics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>It was on that ground that he came to be elected; for he represented a county where the party to which he had belonged was always in a minority. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/> He proceeded to speak of the resolutions of the gentleman from <placeName key="tgn,2002186" n="1.000 7" reg="rockbridge, virginia, united states">Rockbridge</placeName>, (<persName n="Moore,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:Moore,William,T.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Moore</surname></persName>.) The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of those resolutions sets forth some of the grievances we had suffered from the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Yet it has been said, notwithstanding, that there has not been complaint enough of the acts of the <rs>North</rs>--that we have not abused them enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Gentlemen are not satisfied with resolutions denouncing Northern aggression, but would have us go farther. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/> It was true that some of the <rs>Northern States</rs>--not all &mdash; had passed what they called Personal Liberty bills, to obstruct the operation of the <rs>Fugitive Slave Law</rs>. These States we denounce, and say they ought to repeal those laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>But it was the universal practice, when alluding to our grievances, to denounce the whole people of the <rs>North</rs>, without any exception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>The Personal Liberty bills, he proceeded, were against the rights and interests of the <rs>Southern</rs> people, and we ought to demand their repeal; but we ought to remember, at the same time, that they are not Federal laws, and so far as Federal law is concerned, they are just no laws at all. No <num value="1">one</num> could say that Congress had not done ample justice to the <rs>South</rs> on the questions which involve her vital interest. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/> He had heard it said outside of this hall, as well as in it &mdash; he believed it had been said today &mdash; that <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> ought not to hesitate, but go out at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>He believed he heard the gentleman from <placeName reg="Orange, Essex, New Jersey" key="tgn,2065747">Orange</placeName> say this, and he asked him if he understood him right. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>He wanted gentlemen to state their reasons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>Nothing had been said yet sufficient to satisfy him that there was any good reason for it. He admitted that the <rs>Union</rs> was already dissolved --that <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="7">seven</num> links in the great chain had gone-- but <num value="26">twenty-six</num> yet remained, and <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> was not among the number that had gone. --The stars and stripes still floated over her, and he meant to hold on to that flag till the last hope had fled. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/> He intended to let the <rs>Convention</rs> know just where he stood on this question; but as it was now late, and as it had been the practice to adjourn over to give members a full opportunity of expressing their views, he would give way if any <num value="1">one</num> desired to submit such a motion. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/> This has been a day of excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>The unusual activity on the part of the military, and sundry startling reports during yesterday and to-day, had caused serious apprehensions, and when I tell you that the <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Daniel Webster</rs> is still hovering around our harbor, evidently with evil intent, you will not be surprised at this state of feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>But, no <num value="1">one</num> fears the <rs>Daniel Webster</rs> here; neither do they fear the petty despot at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> who rules the hour, and we, <num value="1">one</num> and all, flaunt hot, burning &mdash; aye, contemptuous defiance, in his, <persName n="Scott,,Winfield,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00254" reg="default:Scott,Winfield,,,"><foreName>Winfield</foreName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>'s, face, and dare him &mdash; defy him and his whole brood of <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> confederates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>This is just what we all feel, every man of us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/> Let me tell you what has, thus far, saved <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> and the men in it: <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, the people here, as a general thing, feel acutely for <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00255" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Maj.</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>'s position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>They would be glad, if possible, to rescue him from his perilous situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>And again, they wish to defer to your good old State and wait and see what your Peace Commissioners will do. In deference to <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> the people have acted; but, as we all believe, no good will be achieved by you, but, on the contrary, harm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>You cannot deal with or associate with a people so inferior in everything that ennobles without damage. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/> To-day the <orgName n="Floating Battery" type="battery">floating battery</orgName> was launched, and will be finished and the guns be put in place in the course of this week. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/> Another, and a still more formidable engine of destruction has just been completed, constructed by an intelligent mechanic of this city, for scaling the walls of <placeName key="tgn,2096786" n="1.000 14" reg="sumter, sumter, south carolina">Sumter</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/> I saw to-day a letter purporting to be from <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, to <q>&#x0022;a friend in <placeName reg="Orange, New York, United States" key="tgn,1002751">Orange county, New York</placeName>,&#x0022;</q> in which he brags hugely of their intentions, &#x0026;c. I confess I feel some sympathy for <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00256" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Maj.</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> in his trying position, and I would, if I could, take that young <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginian</rs>, <persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00257" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><surname>Meade</surname></persName>, out of that fort unhurt; but some of the officers there will have the <q>&#x0022;starch taken out of them&#x0022;</q> before they wish it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/> By the way, how do you and your intelligent readers like the speeches of your new <rs type="role2">President</rs> effect?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>He is an eloquent fellow, is he not?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>His speeches are remarkably chaste, and his receptions &mdash; are they not marked by elegant wit?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>It took place at <time value="3:5pm">3 &#x00BD; o'clock P.
