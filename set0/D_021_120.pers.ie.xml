Though ours cannot be fully defended, we know that the men who compose it are true to the cause; that they are the constituted authorities under the <rs>Constitution</rs>; that under them we must conquer or be conquered, and that we must give them all the support and confidence we can, trusting that they will profit by experience and make every disaster the occasion for improving their measures for defence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/> But with all the mistakes and blunders that may be alleged, what is the state of the case?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>The Southern army has not been defeated anywhere in a field fight in which the enemy was not assisted by his gunboats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>The disasters we have met have been all at isolated posts on the water, where the enemy could bring the most approved machinery of his mechanical genius to bear upon our imperfectly-constructed and imperfectly-guarded defences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>There, and there only, has he triumphed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>It is true, he has gained important advantages by our disasters at these points; but they did not establish for him any such superiority over us as to justify a hope that be would conquer us, or to warrant the fear on our part that we would be subjugated.--They forced us to draw in our lines of defence and concentrate our troops; and they force him, of necessity, to follow after us and to essay our defeat by attacking our army, thus concentrated, away from the element where his only great advantage over us is apparent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>In this new phase of the game of the war, if we may judge from the past &mdash; If we may take the result of all the great contests with the enemy <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> in the open field as indicative of the future &mdash; we may not only be hopeful, but confident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>Our armies must triumph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>We cannot doubt it. The motives, the men, the situation, all inevitably force the conclusion that victory, undisputed, clear and decisive, must finally be on our side. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/> The summer is at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>The waters must fall so as to curtail the power of the too much dreaded gunboats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>The diseases of the climate must tell upon the invader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>He has more country to guard in the far <rs>South</rs>, and must be severely harassed and weakened by pestilence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>His large armies in various directions, as they have penetrated farther than ever from their homes, must be victualled with immensely increasing difficulty, (indeed we know here how they have already suffered in the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>.) Our sufferings in our own land cannot be so great as his, but we ought to endure and bear more than he can, as we struggle for all that is dear on earth and he only for power and plunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>At such a time, and amidst such discomforts of the enemy, if we only be true to ourselves, if we only be sufficiently active and sagacious, we shall strike blows upon him from which he cannot recover.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>He is expending all his power and means to subjugate us. We have but to be constant persevering and watchful &mdash; never relaxing, never desponding &mdash; and he will inevitably break down in his mighty crusade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>It cannot be long maintained in such vast proportions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>It is a thing impossible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/> The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> great event will likely be the attempt to take this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>The fight in this vicinity will be a great struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>Our soldiers are confident, and our people rely upon them and their commanders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>If they are both in our favor they may possibly end the war; at all events, the enemy could not recover from <num value="2">two</num> such defeats this year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>Should either or both be against us, we must only gather up the remains of battle and prepare for that prolonged struggle which, with a brave people and unregenerate descendants of the men of the <name>Revolution</name> of '<num value="76">76</num>, must terminate in favor of liberty and independence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/> But we repeat, the battles thus far in the field prove that our true and brave Southern men can defeat the enemy with the odds of numbers on his side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>The continuation of the war will only continue this illustration in our favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>There is no reason for despondency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>We may regret blunders and time lost; but we have the greatest cause for consolation, nay, rejoicing, that we have accomplished so much upon such short notice, and should never fail to remember that in every contest where there was the least semblance of fairness and with the odds always against us, we have proved our power to whip the enemy, and his utter inability to conquer the country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/> Let us, therefore, take courage &mdash; cheer up &mdash; sustain the <rs>Government</rs> &mdash; strengthen and feed the army &mdash; stand by the cause to the bitter end, and we shall conquer gloriously, and ere long enjoy the peace and independence which it is to be hoped we shall have merited. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>The campaign will not be decided by little towns on the coast, but by great armies in the field, and on some point of ground the presence of <num value="10000">10,000</num> men, or their absence, may decide the fate of a battle and a campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>Now, the result of these operations on the coast is to throw <num value="15000">15,000</num> Southern troops which were idle into the active service of the field, and to withdraw <num value="15000">15,000</num> Northern troops from the field to while away their time in sea bathing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>The effect is to strengthen the comparative force of the <rs>South</rs> on the really vital point by <num value="30000">30,000</num> men. Nor is this all. What is the cost to the <rs>North</rs> of this branch of its operations?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>It is now much larger than the army at the <rs>Alma</rs>, and every man at twice the rate of pay. And what will be the position of these men a few weeks hence?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>That, when stripped of all exaggeration, was really a weighty blow and was followed by unworthy confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>On many accounts time is of vital importance, yet, what has been done?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>A Governor appointed the most offensive to the people that could have been found; <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName> is occupied, and the papers are suppressed; but meanwhile, the <rs>Southern</rs> forces have collected at <placeName reg="Jackson, Madison, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099733">Jackson</placeName>, <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>, <placeName reg="Decatur, Meigs, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098787">Decatur</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, and the main Southern <orgName n="Army of the West" type="army">army of the West</orgName> has never been engaged. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/> <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> is a central position of great value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>In the midst of a hilly country, healthy, and defensible against <num value="2">two</num>-fold numbers, it is connected by lines of railway with <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, <placeName reg="Savannah, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101410">Savannah</placeName>, New Orleans, <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>Hence an army placed here could send a division at once to any of those points, or if itself threatened could receive aid from each of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>In the event of disaster to the <rs>Northern</rs> forces that army would re-occupy <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>, nor could any large force pass further South and leave it in the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>Hence we shall be likely to find this a prominent position in the future of the war, should the <rs>Southern</rs> forces be driven out of the border States. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/> It is, indeed, true that all parties in the <rs>North</rs> assume that the loss of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> would terminate the struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>But they were equally certain that on the loss of <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee">Fort Donelson</placeName> the <name>Southerners</name> would throw down their arms, and so strong was this delusion that cotton, which had touched <measure n="40cents" type="currency">forty cents</measure> per pound, actually fell to <num value="20">twenty</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>The loss of both <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> would still leave the original Confederacy intact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>It was the view of many of the ablest politicians of the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> States that the adhesion of the <rs>Border States</rs> would be a disadvantage to them &mdash; that, standing alone, they were of <num value="1">one</num> mind on all points, while the accession of those States would introduce, to some extent, other interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>Further, they held that the <rs>Border States</rs> would be of more value as their natural allies, within the camp of their adversaries, than if enlisted on their side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>Hence, the loss of the whole of those States would simply bring back the movement to its original dimensions, and to the position which many of its ablest men deemed from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to be most advantageous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>It is true, there would be for a time a great loss of prestige, but that has not generally been much considered by men fighting for independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>In a military sense, it would bring into play the physical advantages of the <rs>South</rs>, of which their opponents have yet to experience the effects. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/> Many, indeed, believe that the moral effect would be decisive; but here the division of the country into States, each in itself thoroughly and independently organized, and in size a kingdom, acts as a barrier to the progress of moral influences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>To us, as we read or think, New Orleans and <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> come within the same field of view, but this is not so on the spot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>There they are separated by a vast distance; an occurrence at <num value="1">one</num> of them is to the other a remote event.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>If New Orleans were taken, there would be a panic for a time throughout <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, but at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> the effect would probably be a burning desire to retrieve the disgrace. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>What the effect on the money market of New York?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>Such an event is by no means as improbable as that the <rs>Merrimac</rs> in her <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sally should destroy <num value="2">two</num> frigates and <num value="3">three</num> gunboats, or that <placeName key="tgn,7013988" n="1.000 2272" reg="bull run, prince william, virginia">Bull Run</placeName> should be retrieved by returning from it a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>The archives have been removed to a place in the interior where the enemy is by no means likely to find them, and all the cotton at <placeName key="tgn,7017543" n="1.000 293" reg="baton rouge, baton rouge, louisiana">Baton Rouge</placeName> and along the river is now a mass of smouldering fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>All the sugar, too, has either been carried to a place of security or destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>Our informant did not visit the arsenal and armory and other Confederate buildings, and therefore cannot speak positively on the point, but his impression is that all the <rs type="place">Government stores</rs>, machinery, ammunition, &#x0026;c., have either been removed or left in such a condition as to be valueless to the enemy. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>The Governor does not attempt to depreciate the enemy's success, but at the same time he calls upon all citizens of the <rs>State</rs> to do all in their power to render that success as fruitless and as short lived as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>Preparations were made for a general departure to the interior, and though all excitement had passed away when our informant left, still numbers continued to leave, both by land and water, in anticipation of a visit from the fleet, no portion of which, we are assured, contrary to city reports, had visited the <rs>Capital</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/> Our informant is positive that none of the fleet have been higher up than Carroliton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>He saw none on Monday on his way down; nor could they have passed him during the night unobserved, as he was awake every hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>We conclude, then, that up to noon Tuesday Baton Rouge had not been occupied, nor had the <rs>Federal</rs> flag been hoisted on the <rs>Capitol</rs>, notwithstanding the averment of all the <q>&#x0022;reliable&#x0022;</q> in the city. </p> </div4>
