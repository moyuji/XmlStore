<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>At the same time he said that if the enemy desired to renew the exchange, they must do it on the terms and in the manner specified by the cared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/><persName n="Onid,Commissioner,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00187" reg="mostcommon:Onid,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commissioner">Commissioner</roleName> <surname>Onid</surname></persName> was perfectly right in doing what he did. Beast <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00188" reg="nearbymention:Butler,Elizabeth,,,"><surname>Butler</surname></persName> is an outlaw, and liable to be hung by the <orgName type="regiment" key="Confed1">first Confederate</orgName> officer that may lay hands on him. No honorable man can voluntarily hold any intercourse with him. At the same time, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> must not be allowed to get rid of the <hi rend="italics">cartel</hi> by such an evasion at that attempted by <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00189" reg="nearbymention:Butler,Elizabeth,,,"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> makes the following statement with regard to the prisoners captured at <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> and <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName>: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/> At <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> over <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> rebel prisoners fall into our hands, and over <num value="5000">five thousand</num> more at <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>These prisoners were paroled and suffered to return to their homes until exchanged, pursuant to the terms of the cartel.--But the rebel agent, in violation of the cartel, declared the <rs>Vicksburg</rs> prisoners exchanged without being exchanged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>The <rs type="place">Port Hudson</rs> prisoners he, without just cause and in open violation of the cartel, declared released from their parole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>These prisoners were returned to their ranks, and a portion of them were found fighting at <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, and a gain captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>For this breach of faith &mdash; unexampled in civilized warfare &mdash; the only apology or excuse was that an equal number of prisoners had been captured by the enemy; but on calling for specifications in regard to these of logged prisoners it was found that a considerate number represented as prisoners were not soldiers, but were non-combatants, citizens of towns and village, farmers, travelers, and others in civil life, not captured in battle, but taken at their homes, on their farms, or on the highway, by <persName n="Morgan,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00190" reg="default:Morgan,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Morgan</surname></persName> and other rebel raiders, who put them under a shampooer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>To balance these men against rebel soldiers taken on the field would be relieving the enemy from the pressure of war and enabling him to protract the contest to indefinite duration. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/> If it had been true that we had released from exchange all the prisoners captured at <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> and <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName>, we should have been perfectly justified in so doing.--In the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day's <rs n="Battle of Gettysburg" type="battle">battle at Gettysburg</rs> <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00191" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Sam,Jones.,Fitz,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> <measure n="6000" type="captured">captured six thousand</measure> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, who, having been paroled, were sent through the enemy's lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>Instead of respecting this parole these men were immediately ordered into the ranks by <persName n="Meade,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00192" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Meade</surname></persName>, and fought during the remaining <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure>. The excuse for this unheard of breach of faith was that a new interpretation had been put on the cartel at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>; that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisoners not having been paroled by the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs> in person the parole was worth nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>Like all cunning men, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> overreached themselves; for at the very time they committed this breach of faith the garrison of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> was about to surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>It did surrender the next day, and was paroled, as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were at <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName>, not by the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs> in person, but by subordinate officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>Of course our own officers had a perfect right to put upon the cartel the same interpretation just put upon it by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>They did so, and worsted the cunning <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> in the bargain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/><hi rend="italics"><persName n="Hine,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00193" reg="mostcommon:Hine,nomatch:0"><surname>Hine</surname></persName> alles lachrym&#x0153;</hi>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/> But we did not declare all exchanged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>A large number, probably at least half, was especially excepted, as may be seen by the exchange notices already published.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>Nor is it true that &#x0022;a considerable number, represented as prisoners, were not soldiers, but non-combatants, citizens of towns and villages, farmers, &#x0026;c.&#x0022; <persName n="Ould,Judge,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00194" reg="nearbymention:Ould,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Judge">judge</roleName> <surname>Ould</surname></persName>, in a letter to <persName n="Hitchcock,Commissioner,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00195" reg="nearbymention:Hitchcock,E.,F.,,"><roleName n="Commissioner">Commissioner</roleName> <surname>Hitchcock</surname></persName>, published in the <hi rend="italics">Enquirer</hi>, of yesterday, along with <persName n="Hitchcock,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00196" reg="nearbymention:Hitchcock,E.,F.,,"><surname>Hitchcock</surname></persName>'s answer acknowledging the receipt of the same, proposed to exclude from the list of exchanges all the classes of persons designated as above, and as <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00197" reg="mostcommon:Stanton,nomatch:0"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName> must have had this correspondence before him when he made the statement, the confusion is, that he deliberately lied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>The --ole embroilment is peculiarly characteristic of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>At <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName>, they found it very convenient to release their prisoners from parole, and they did not suffer any scruples with regard to the good faith of the transaction, to interfere with a project so advantageous to themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>In this case, as in every other, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> consideration with them was, &#x0022;will it pay?&#x0022; They found that it would, or thought they had thus found, and they hesitated no longer.--But reseals are almost always sure to overreach themselves, and they did so in this instance most egregiously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>We are deeply anxious to see the cartel resumed on fair terms, and provided there can be any guarantee for its proper observance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>But we do not wish to see a system of irregular exchanges introduced, for most assuredly such a system can have no object but to obtain an advantage at our expense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>Above all, we wish to have no correspondence with <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00198" reg="nearbymention:Butler,Elizabeth,,,"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>, that wretch who is an object of abhorrence to both hemispheres, and whose name is never mentioned anywhere, except in Yankeedom, but with Jeers and execration. </p> </div3>
