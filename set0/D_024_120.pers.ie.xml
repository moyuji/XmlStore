<head>Household industry.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> At a time like this we are glad to know that those household arts which our ancestral mothers, of Revolutionary and revered memory, plied so industriously and with so much advantage to the nation, are revived in the country generally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>There is nothing more agreeable to the true Southern man and patriot than the busy hum of the spinning wheel and the industrious clatter of the loom, as he approaches the country mansion, where those sounds have been hushed for <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The loom and the wheel had been <placeName key="tgn,2081840" n="1.000 1" reg="shandon, butler, ohio">Shandon</placeName>, and <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> cotton, <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> sheetings and shirtings, were introduced everywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The handiwork of woman was revolutionized, and her labors directed to less useful employment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>With the change in industry came a change in dress and manners, until the older inhabitants could contemplate a revolution social, as well as industrial, that was melancholy and discouraging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Simplicity and virtue are twin sisters, and adversity is their nurse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>These framed the characters and the manners of the noble women of '<num value="76">76</num>, and made them models to their sex in all ages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>They were the spirit and the soul of the <name>Revolution</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>They imbued the men with their zeal and their national devotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>They clothed and fed them, and nursed them when sick and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Untiring and unflagging in their exertions in their homes, in the hospitals, and even in the severe industry of the fields, they ministered to the wants and the sufferings of the <name>Revolutionary</name> soldiers, and thus gave an indispensable aid in securing victory and independence to the country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> It is a matter of pride to us now to see our mothers and daughters readily accepting the conditions and consequences of the war, and entering upon the part which belongs to them with an energy and patriotism &mdash; nay, piety &mdash; which makes them worthy descendants of their mothers of '<num value="76">76</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>They have reinstalled the spinning wheel and the loom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>They are reviving the long forgotten household arts, and show as much tact and capacity in them as if they had never been suspended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>They are imitating the example and displaying the virtues of what we had believed to have been a better day and a better time, and are showing that though modern art and commerce had changed their occupations and their customs, they still preserve all the constancy, all the public spirit, all the promptness at self-sacrifice, all the heroism of the women of '<num value="76">76</num>.--They are achieving wonders in their exertions to clothe, feed, and comfort the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Their means and appliances for these objects are increasing daily, and we shall find that in our country the character of woman and her important part in the great struggles of nations for independence will be more than vindicated.
