<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> last, a large crowd of <unclear></unclear> with a fine band of music, serenaded <unclear></unclear> at the <rs type="place">Charleston Hotel</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The <unclear></unclear> made a thrilling speech, in the arse of which he said: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> I said on the <date value="12-17">17th of December</date> last, on an occasion similar to this, that true <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> stood alone, but in this there was nothing to fear, for she had on a memorable occasion previous to the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> itself, stood alone and fought the <rs n="Battle of Fort Moultrie" type="battle">battle of Fort Moultrie</rs>, where she had sunk the ships of <num value="1">one</num> of the proudest nations of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>[Great applause,] And I said to you that on the bloody battle-field of <placeName reg="Churubusco, Clinton, New York" key="tgn,2068513">Churubusco</placeName> our noble regiment had marched across that field under a fiery storm, such as has seldom been seen, and that, if need be, she could now stand alone again and fight alone for her independence and her liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>And now, fellow citizens, on this, the <date value="1861-04-18">18th day of April, 1861,</date> she has again fought alone and defeated an arrogant and assuming power, and she has gloriously triumphed alone, and thus again <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Fort Moultrie</placeName>, which was so dear in our independence of <dateStruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></dateStruct>, has again answered, and is consecrated and baptized over again in our independence and freedom of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>[Applause.] </p> </q><bibl n="Governor Pickens"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> I studiously declined receiving volunteers, who so nobly and so gallantly offered themselves, from other States, because we had so many among ourselves who desired a place of danger and of peril, and demanded it as a right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>I besides desired, as we had begun it <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and alone, without consultation, and, as some said, rashly, I desired, under these circumstances, that if we had to fight for our independence again that the battle should be fought and won by <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> alone, upon the same bloody field where she had fought for her independence in the days of her <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>[Great applause.] True, true, we owe much to science and to the gallantry of <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>, who was sent to us by the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>We do owe to him all honor and all gratitude for his high and manly bearing and noble conduct; but as far as our own companies, our battalions, our regiments and our men were concerned, the triumphs of this day have been due literally to <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> troops alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>[The applause was so great at this time that it was some moments before <persName n="Pickens,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Pickens,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Pickens</surname></persName> could proceed.] I do not mean to say this (said the <rs>Governor</rs>) by way of exultation, but as due to the truth of history, and I say it because <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> has been peculiarly singled out and a bused and traduced and sneezed at as being too weak and too small to defend herself, and was accused of arrogance and presumption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>But this day shows that weak as we were supposed to be, we have defied the power of our enemies, and defied them upon their sought and chosen battle field. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> And now I here, in the name of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, return the gratitude of the <rs>State</rs> to those gallant and intelligent officers who have come forward and so generously served their State in this, her day of trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>And they are too numerous even to mention in detail; and I return the thanks and the gratitude of the <rs>State</rs> to those brave, and true, and patriotic young men who have left their business, who have sacrificed their greatest interests, to come forward and to seek eagerly to defend their country, when it was supposed that peril, danger, and even death, were inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>It is, indeed, to them not only a glorious day of triumph, but I, too, with feelings of deep gratitude, am enabled to return them back to their fond homes and kindred uninjured, and with the proud consciousness that the honor of their State has been unstained, and that their gallantry has been shown by the noble manner in which they have manned the batteries for their country's independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>It is to those men, and those officers, that we owe everything; and I do not pretend to claim anything myself, except that my heart has been filled with deep anxiety, and I have spent my nights in painful and constant examination of all the details and all the points that might be necessary not only to save the lives of our brave men, but to defend the independence of my country, and when the day had come at the proper time to strike, and to strike for her independence, at any and at every hazard, let the consequences be what they may. [Prolonged applause.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> We have now taught a great lesson to this Confederacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>It is now clear that for all purposes of justice, of equality, and of common liberty, our <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> institutions are as strong as any that have ever been offered for the government of man. But when they are perverted to the purposes of injustice and fanaticism, of insult and wrong, that those same institutions are powerless; and that when they lose that power which comes from right, that as far as the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> people are concerned, they are impotent and imbecile, because the heart, the great heart of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> people in reality, beats for what is right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>[Immense cheering.] We then stand upon the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>We stand upon the inalienable right of a people to choose their own institutions, and that all just government rests upon the consent of the governed, and that any Government that attempts to exercise power without this consent not only is unjust to a brave, true, and patriotic people, but that people can defy that power, and they can conquer, and they can triumph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> A reign of terror has been inaugurated in <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The papers of that city give detailed accounts of the lawless proceedings of the mob on <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> At <time value="1oclock">one o'clock</time> the <orgName n="Argus office" type="office">Argus office</orgName> was surrounded by an infuriated mass of human beings, who would have torn it out had not the proprietor promised to fling out the <rs>National</rs> colors as soon as he could obtain <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>These lawless proceedings caused much alarm to the order-loving citizens, reviving the memories of the riots of <dateStruct value="1844--"><year reg="1844">1844</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The mob was mostly composed of fiery youths from the outer districts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> After visiting the newspaper offices and Government property, they marched in a body up <address><street n="Market street">Market street</street></address>, bearing a flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>At all points on the route well-known Union men were obliged to make all haste to borrow, beg, or steal something <rs type="color">red</rs>, <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">blue</rs> to protect their property with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Searches were made for the publication rooms of the <rs>Southern Monitor</rs>, but as that paper has suspended, the mob were unable to carry out their intention of destroying the forms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>They satisfied themselves with breaking the signs to pieces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The ringleaders were furnished with ropes with which to hang the editor, if caught. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> Between <time value="8">eight</time> and <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time> on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time>, several <num value="1000">thousand</num> persons assembled around <placeName><persName n="Patterson,Major-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Patterson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major-General">Major General</roleName> <surname>Patterson</surname></persName>'s house</placeName>, at <address><street n="13 Street">Thirteenth</street></address> and <address><street n="Locust Street">Locust streets</street></address>, who amused themselves by shouting and groaning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Soon after this, a number of stones were thrown and several windows broken in his dwelling and green-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The General appeared and scattered the assailants by a short speech.--He said: <q>&#x0022;You have come here to fight, it appears; now, if you will enlist yourselves, I will lead you wherever you wish to go.&#x0022;</q> The police having arrived in large numbers, the crowd slowly separated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The house of the <rs>General</rs> was visited at an earlier hour by a mob much smaller in number, many of whom were boys, and who gave great annoyance to the neighbors by their rude conduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>They demanded that the <rs>General</rs> should exhibit an <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> flag, which he willingly did, stating that he wondered that any <num value="1">one</num> should doubt his loyalty to the flag he had fought under and was willing to fight under again. --This appeared to ease their minds of grave doubts as to the <rs>General</rs>'s sincerity, and for a moment left them without a target. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> The mob then visited <persName n="Cadwallader,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Cadwallader,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Cadwallader</surname></persName>, who made a Union speech and threw out a flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>At least <num value="10000">10,000</num> people gathered in <address><street n="Chestnut street">Chestnut street</street></address> all day. Happily, a heavy rain commenced to fall in the evening, and the crowds dispersed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> Several prominent Southerners, with secession proclivities, including <persName n="Tyler,,Robert,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="default:Tyler,Robert,,,"><foreName n="Robert">Robt.</foreName> <surname>Tyler</surname></persName>, have received warnings from a so-called <orgName n="Vigilance Committee" type="committee">Vigilance Committee</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> The voluntary or compulsory exhibition of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> colors was not confined to the secular newspaper offices &mdash; the <rs>Episcopal Recorder</rs> and the <rs n="Catholic" type="religion">Catholic</rs> Herald having also been visited. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/> The flag at the <rs>Continental</rs> having been taken down in consequence of the rain, a large party visited the bar-room, and demanded that it should be immediately raised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The proprietor at once acquiesced. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> The excitement seems to have extended into <unclear></unclear> districts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>To save the building from destruction, it was agreed that all the stock on hand, consisting of <num value="2">two</num> furniture car loads of primers, and other munitions of war, should be placed in the station-house, which was done.
