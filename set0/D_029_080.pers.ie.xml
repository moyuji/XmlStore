<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> There was a report yesterday to the effect that the <name>Radicals</name> in Congress would soon make a great show of magnanimity by admitting to their seats the representatives, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> from <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> from <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>, and <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> from <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, provided those from the latter car take the test oath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>I was inclined to doubt the truth of the report at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, but after investigation I believe it is well founded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>What the object in view can be does not yet appear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>It cannot be that the <name>Radicals</name> look upon it as an accession of strength to their party, for it will be the reverse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>There are <num value="3">three</num> (so-called) <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> members from <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, but they are no more <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> in their feelings than <persName n="Johnson,,Andrew,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="default:Johnson,Andrew,,,"><foreName>Andrew</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName> is.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>If the whole <num value="19">nineteen</num> members from the <num value="3">three</num> States are admitted, <num value="16">sixteen</num> will certainly vote with the <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs>, and only <num value="3">three</num> with the <name>Radicals</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The strength of parties in the <rs type="place">House</rs> will then be: Radicals, <num value="142">142</num>; <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs> and Conservatives, <num value="52">52</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Your readers can see that the <rs type="place">Radicals run</rs> no risk in the admission of the representatives from these <num value="3">three</num> States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>They will still retain an overwhelming majority, although the <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs> will receive a large accession to their numbers. </p> </q><bibl n="New York News"></bibl></cit>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>There is no prospect, however, that any of the <rs>Southern</rs> members will be admitted this session, except those from <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> and <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>, and possibly those from <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> The <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> members of the <name>Senate</name> yesterday were in caucus upon the resolutions of <persName n="Stevens,Mister,Thaddeus,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="default:Stevens,Thaddeus,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Thaddeus</foreName> <surname>Stevens</surname></persName> relating to reconstruction.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> It is expected that there will be a strong opposition to the passage of the <rs>Stevens</rs> resolution in the <name>Senate</name>, mainly on the ground that it would make the action of that body as to the admission of its own members dependent upon the concurrence of the <rs type="place">House</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>This, in fact, was the objective trait urged in a caucus of the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> members of the <name>Senate</name> today.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>But whatever modification it may undergo in point of form, there is no doubt that the principle of the restoration will be adopted and that the investigation will be read. </p> </q><bibl n="The New York Tribune"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> About the meaning of that resolution there can be no doubt; it is a declaration on the part of Congress that the representatives of the people have a word to say with regard to the reconstruction of the <name>States</name> lately in rebellion: that they mean to investigate the case for themselves, and to act upon their own judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The resolution involves neither a direct approval nor a direct censure of the policy followed by the <rs>President</rs>; but it does, indeed, indicate that the results of that policy will not be accepted without having <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> been closely scrutinized, and that the national authority will not relax its hold upon the late rebel States until the guaranties given for future good behavior are clearly understood to be satisfactory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>It is rumored here that the passage of the <rs>Stevens</rs> resolution was received with little favor in Administration circles; but, in fact, the <rs>President</rs> has no right to complain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>That the final closing up of so tremendous a revolution as that through which we have passed should be confided to the discretion of <num value="1">one</num> man, could not be expected in a country in which the exercise of Democratic government has become a fixed habit with the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> has assumed responsibilities almost without precedent in the history of this republic, and even his nearest personal friends will hardly ask for him an unqualified endorsement without a close examination of the case, where the stake consists in the future peace and happiness of the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>There was a way for him to escape this responsibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>He might have called an extra session of Congress immediately after the close of the war, and the legislative and executive branches of the <rs>Government</rs> might have unanimously proceeded together in an attempt to solve the great problem before them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>But as the <rs>President</rs> undertook the business alone, it cannot be surprising to him that the <orgName n="National Legislature" type="legislature">National Legislature</orgName>, when at the regular time entering upon its functions, should ask for an account of what has been done, and insist upon being heard concerning what is to be done hereafter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> The <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="National Intelligencer" type="newspaper">National Intelligencer</orgName></hi> thus argues specially for the admission of the <rs>Virginia</rs> members: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> When the body of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> seceded, the north<name>west</name> and <name>east</name>ern sections refused to desert the <rs>Union</rs>, but they proclaimed themselves a loyal community at the outset; and these relations with the <rs>Federal Government</rs> have never been suspended, but have continued uninterruptedly, without intermission. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> What is recognized as <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> was even before <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> in the abolition of slavery and the adoption of the constitutional amendment, and in the acts of repudiating the rebel debt and of declaring the ordinances of secession to be null and void. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> The Alexandria Legislature was entirely loyal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The <rs>Senators</rs> elect, <persName n="Segar,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Segar,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Segar</surname></persName> and <persName n="Underwood,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Underwood,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Underwood</surname></persName>, are everywhere recognized as loyal; the <rs>Governor</rs> of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, regularly elected, is of indisputable loyalty; and we can recognize no technicality which, under radical reasoning, should exclude <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> even for an instant on the score of the loyalty of the <rs>State</rs>, since it <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> unfurled the flag of the <rs>Union</rs> in a community of armed and defiant secessionists. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> We are becoming more and more sanguine that it is out of the power of politicians (even if they shall see fit to manifest a strong will to do so) to defeat the speedy triumph of restoration now nearly accomplished by the <rs>President</rs>. </p> </div3>

<head>The work of &#x0022;Reconstruction.&#x0022;</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/> While there is in progress the work of political &#x0022;reconstruction&#x0022; of the late dismembered <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, there is another kind of work of &#x0022;reconstruction&#x0022; of a purely local character, of the utmost importance to the communities interested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>The sooner they address themselves to their several undertakings, the better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>In the war, the means of the country have been nearly exhausted; but that which consists in the energy and industry of men, and their integrity, which can never be alienated or robbed, and which is the surest basis of credit and resource, as well to nations and communities as individuals, is still left our people, and can and should be employed actively. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/> This city has a heavier labor before it than probably any Southern town, owing to the destruction of so large a part of its business district.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>In this way, not only is the work for it to do increased, but the means from taxation seriously diminished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>Rightly viewed, our misfortunes impose upon us the duty of exertion in proportion to the demands they create.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>To stimulate the enterprise of our corporate authorities, they may feel assured that the great revolution just accomplished, whatever of evils it may have brought upon the country, will certainly ultimately largely increase the aggregate wealth and population of this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>Whatever of outlay a wise expenditure for the improvement of this city may involve will, therefore, be easily paid at a day not very remote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>There need be no hesitation on the part of the city authorities to proceed at once to the work plainly pointed out to them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/> <num value="1">One</num> of their most immediate duties, and which cannot, with economy or prudence, be postponed, is the widening and grading of certain streets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>In a few months the vacant lots which now are in the lines of several much-needed improvements, will be built upon, and then, if condemned, the cost of the houses will swell damages enormously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>It would, too, subject owners of property to inconceivable inconvenience and loss to grade streets after their buildings are finished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>Indeed, we imagine the city would have no idea of undertaking such an improvement then; and we should have to conduct our trade for another half century, perhaps, with all the inconveniences of bad grades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>These, and many other matters that readily suggest themselves, require the promptest attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>The low state of the <name>Treasury</name> is not a sufficient excuse for leaving things where they are. A proper system of improvement would bestow immediate advantages, and so promote the general prosperity as to return a rich compensation to both citizens and corporation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/> The State and the people of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> have herculean labors before them; but the stimulants to exertion are in proportion to the magnitude of the things that are to be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>The people have to change their systems of culture, they have to diminish the area of tillage, and to do what they do more carefully and more economically.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>They will have to keep fewer horses, fewer cattle, and to keep them better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>Many will have to diminish the extent of their household, to compact their offices, to keep their gear and <rs n="agricultural implements" type="product">agricultural implements</rs> carefully sheltered, and to attend in person all the work and movement on their farms; nay, to <hi rend="italics">do no small amount of it themselves.</hi> Many will, we regret to say, have to be more economical and less hospitable &mdash; to live plainer, less extravagantly, and to entertain fewer guests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>By selling their excess of land and resorting to these means, they will live quite free of debt and <unclear></unclear> independently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>Perhaps they will have more cash than they were wont in days gone by to have in hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>It is true they may become more selfish, and less genial; but then, upon this kind of economy through the country, there will be a larger aggregate yield, and a larger aggregate surplus to support and maintain a very much increased population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>There will be, indeed, under this state of things, more people and more general wealth, but less happiness &mdash; less individuality and personal dignity of character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>But since old things have passed away, and never to be recalled, we should, as wise and true men, make the best of the &#x0022;situation.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>By a wise employment of these great natural gifts, and the inviting of emigration and capital to assist in the work, in a year or <num value="2">two</num> we shall have gone far towards lifting up State and people from the condition of prostration in which the war left them, and to restore the vast wealth which that war and its disastrous termination swept away from us. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>Some <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> afterwards he entered the office and inquired for <num value="1">one</num> of the proprietors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>I invited him in, and he made a statement, in effect, as follows: That he was a <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> detective, from New Orleans, and that he was here for the purpose of recovering a quantity of jewelry which had been stolen; that he was employed by the firm of Brutus Long &#x0026; Co. to ferret the matter out; that he did not know but he might be detained here some time, and asked whether I could not board him cheaper than I was doing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>I informed him that he might take a room on the upper floor for <measure n="75dollars" type="currency">$75</measure> per month; and he agreed to do it. He was, I think, at the house <measure n="17days" type="date">seventeen days</measure>, but has never paid his board bill.--About a week after his arrival, <persName n="Croft,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00137" reg="nearbymention:Croft,J.,N.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Croft</surname></persName> asked me whether I knew him or not.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>I then questioned <persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00140" reg="nearbymention:Scott,Samuel,W.,,"><surname>Scott</surname></persName> about his being a detective, and he said he was here with <num value="1">one</num> of the chief detectives of <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, named <persName n="Franklin,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00141" reg="mostcommon:Franklin,nomatch:0"><surname>Franklin</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>After this, I telegraphed Deputy <orgName n="U. S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>The answer received (which is here produced) was that <persName n="Franklin,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00144" reg="mostcommon:Franklin,nomatch:0"><surname>Franklin</surname></persName> had not been in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> since the evacuation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>I then had <persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00145" reg="nearbymention:Scott,Samuel,W.,,"><surname>Scott</surname></persName> arrested, and requested him to show his authority for representing himself as a <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> detective.--He replied that he could not do so. It was in consequence of his representations that he was a secret agent of the <rs>Government</rs> that I gave him credit for his board. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/> <persName n="Corkery,,W.,F.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00146" reg="default:Corkery,W.,F.,,"><foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <surname>Corkery</surname></persName>, the other proprietor of the <name>Spotswood</name>, testified that he was present when the conversation occurred between <persName n="Millward,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00147" reg="nearbymention:Millward,James,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Millward</surname></persName> and the prisoner; that he was acquainted in New Orleans, and never heard of such a firm as Brutus Long &#x0026; Co. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/> <persName n="Croft,Major,J.,N.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00150" reg="default:Croft,J.,N.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>N.</foreName> <surname>Croft</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Chief of Police">Chief of Police</rs>, sworn.--<persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00151" reg="nearbymention:Scott,Samuel,W.,,"><surname>Scott</surname></persName> came to my office about the <date value="10-30">30th of October</date> and inquired whether I had received a package for him. I told him I had not, when he expressed much surprise, and went on to tell me that he was a <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> detective from New Orleans, and was here on very important business; that a firm there had been robbed of diamonds to a large amount, and that he was employed to ferret the matter out. He seemed to be well posted in regard to detectives in the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>I subsequently learned that he was not what he claimed to be, and that he was obtaining credit about the city through his false representations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>I then telegraphed to New Orleans, and received a reply from the <rs type="role" reg="Chief of Police">Chief of Police</rs> of that city that no such man as <persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00152" reg="nearbymention:Scott,Samuel,W.,,"><surname>Scott</surname></persName> was employed on their detective force.
