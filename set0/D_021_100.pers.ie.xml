<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> Secessionists here, who undoubtedly have means to communicate with their friends in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> and elsewhere South, speak most confidently that the rebels have another ironclad steamer just completed at <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, equal, they say, if not superior, to the <rs>Merrimac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>I give you this statement as coming to me through sources in which I place considerable reliance, as I know the parties, and am confident they are in frequent underground correspondence with their special friends in the <rs>Southern</rs> army and in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>There is not even the shadow of a doubt that our Baltimore Southern sympathizers have ample facilities of communication with rebels in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and some of them are indiscreet enough to brag of it and boast of the news they are possessed of unknown to the <rs>Government</rs> and to Union citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> It is said our authorities purpose, if they have not already done it, catting on the editors and proprietors of the <rs>Maryland</rs> <hi rend="italics">News Sheet,</hi> to demand of them what means they have of receiving contraband intelligence from the <rs>South</rs>, not known to the <rs>Government</rs>, and why they publish news accompanied with editorial sheers and inuendoes against the country giving them protection, that is denied to loyal newspapers and correspondents. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> It is fair to presume those backed up by the <rs>Government</rs> must in the end triumph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The chances, at least, are a <num value="100">hundred</num> to <num value="1">one</num> in their favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The sooner, therefore, such a consummation is reached the better it must be for all, and the nearer are we to peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Certain it is, if Secessionists had control, they would rule with an iron rod. It is a bad maxim, therefore, that will not work both ways, especially if greater good is the result in the end. </p>
