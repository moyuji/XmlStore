<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>What is the object of his visit?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Has he come to mingle with his soldiers and encourage them by his presence?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Or has he come to compose the strifes of officers, and, if need be, to institute a change in the command of the army? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> I shall not undertake to fix the responsibility for the condition of things in the army now before <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Whether <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName> possesses the requisite qualities for command, or whether his officers have with-held from him that cordial co-operation and support without which no commander, however gifted, can hope for success, are questions which may be reserved for future discussion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> This much, however, may be safely affirmed at this time: <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName> has sufficient reason to desire to be relieved from his present command, and that, too, even if he had been in the right and his opponents in the wrong upon all the points which have been raised against him. He cannot hope to be as useful to the country, or to accomplish as much for his own fame, in his present position as he might reasonably expect to do in some other command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>He and a large majority of his <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> are not in accord; and whether he is right and they are wrong, or they are right and he is wrong, the result is the same &mdash; dissatisfaction on the part of both, disorganisation in the army, and such a want of unity and co-operation as to make it impossible for either <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander in-Chief</rs>, his officers, or his troops, to render to the country as valuable service as they might and would perform under more auspicious circumstances. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> Should the <rs>President</rs> decide, therefore, to send <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName> to some other field where he can be more useful to the cause, and to call some other officer to his place, as he probably will do, such a proceeding would not necessarily imply the censure of the commander of the <orgName n="Army of Tennessee" type="army">Army of Tennessee</orgName>, any more than his refusal to make this change would involve the condemnation of his subordinates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Who the new commander will be, should such a change be deemed advisable, it is impossible yet to determine; but the prevailing opinion is that it will be either <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> or <persName n="Longstreet,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> But the new commander, whoever he may be, will not have a smooth path to tread. --<persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> is a shrewd and able officer; he has already a formidable army, and heavy reinforcements are marching to his support from every available quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Indeed, no pains will be spared by the <rs>Federal Government</rs> to maintain its armies at <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> and <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName>, and eventually to overrun and occupy <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>These preparations on the part of the enemy call for corresponding effort and resolution on our part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>If reinforcements are sent by the enemy, then reinforcements must not be withhold on our side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>Let us take &#x0022;a woodpeckers tap at this hollow beech tree.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/> &#x0022;He replied,&#x0022; so the report says, &#x0022;to the complaints of the <rs>South</rs> in regard to the recognition of the blockade, and asserted that although self-interest demanded that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> should break it, she prefers the course of honor, as it would be infamous to break it.&#x0022; Now, by the treaty of <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>, a blockade, to be respected, must be effectual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>That this blockade has not been effectual, according to <persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00129" reg="nearbymention:Russell,Earl,,,"><surname>Russell</surname></persName>'s own interpretation, is evident enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>If the treaty had been followed out, the blockade would have been broken long since.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>If there be any infamy in the matter, then it is the treaty which is infamous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>A very pretty Government that which forms a treaty which it is infamous to observe. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/> It may be doubted whether, in the opinion at least of <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName>, interest (that is, the interest of the <rs>British Government</rs>) does require the blockade to be broken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>He is a long-headed man, or fancies that he is, and there is but too much reason to believe that he thinks it the interest of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> to prolong this strife, which will exhaust both parties, throw the carrying trade into <name>British</name> hands, and make <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> more completely mistress of the seas than she ever was before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>We wonder whether he is <hi rend="italics">sure</hi> (for all men are liable to self deception) that these motives had no influence upon him. </p>

The ordinary vessel-of-war &mdash; like the <rs>Alabama</rs> &mdash; can only destroy the commerce of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and it is greatly to the interest of <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName>'s constituents that <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> commerce should be destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>It would leave the trade of the world in <name>British</name> hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are, indeed, the only rivals they have the feast cause to fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>Therefore, thinks the <rs>Foreign Secretary</rs>, by all means encourage the destruction of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> commerce, but, as for the <hi rend="italics">rams,</hi> they may pitch into New York and destroy much <name>British</name> property, &#x0026;c. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/> The distinction attempted between <num value="1">one</num> class of war vessels and another is execrably contemptible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>A swift sailing vessel, designed to prey on commerce, is as much a war vessel as a ram; and if <num value="1">one</num> be against law, so is the other.--They are only objectionable be cause they are war vessels, and to destroy a ship at sea is as much an act of war as to bombard a town or blow up a fort.
