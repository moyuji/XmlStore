<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> The subject of the defence of <placeName key="tgn,7013964;tgn,1125114" n="0.500 000001.0000	placename;tgn,7013964;Richmond, Richmond, Virginia,Richmond,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.500 000001.0000	placename;tgn,1125114;James River, Virginia, Virginia,Virginia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia,Richmond,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;James River, Virginia, Virginia,Virginia,United States,North and Central America">James river</placeName> cannot be too often and too earnestly pressed upon the attention of the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities and the people of this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>In the very beginning of the contest &mdash; indeed, before the famous Pawnes alarm, we called attention to the imperative necessity of powerful fortifications upon this river, never doubting that the approach of the enemy to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 7" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> would be by the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>, supported by a powerful fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>At that time we had not learned that ships could prove successful in an attack upon shore batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>We believed what the whole experience of naval warfare had testified, with scarcely an exception, that guns ashore were more than a match for guns afloat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The history of the present war has not proved that idea a fallacy, but it has exhibited a most mortifying succession of disasters, arising from badly constructed and badly located fortifications, in every encounter but <num value="1">one</num> between the <rs>Confederates</rs> and the <rs>Federal</rs> fleets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>That exception was a glorious <num value="1">one</num>; it was <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName>'s defence of <placeName reg="Pensacola, Escambia, Florida" key="tgn,7013972">Pensacola</placeName>, and in driving off with case the most powerful man of-war in the <rs>Federal</rs> navy, he showed what could be done by land batteries, if built and placed in a proper manner. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> But if, at the be ginning of the war, we might invoke (as we long invoked in vain) the attention of our people to the thorough fortification of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>, how much more so now with the lights of the present contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Wherever the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> gunboats have penetrated, our fortifications, with the exception of <persName n="Donelson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Donelson,nomatch:0"><surname>Donelson</surname></persName>, have been silenced, an exception which proves what powerful guns and good gunnery can effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The ordinary earthworks, without bomb-proof shelters, are no protection whatever against vessels under steam, which can shell them out with case, or run by them without difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Moreover, the enemy are now building their gunboats with iron plates, which will make them invulnerable to the missiles of ordinary guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The success of the <rs>Virginia</rs>, we confidently believe, is all that has thus far prevented the attempt of a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> fleet to ascend <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>, and has given us time to make ready for the period when they will, in spite of the <rs>Virginia</rs>, be able to make such an attempt.--What these defences should be, we cannot present to designates but must leave it to the naval and military chiefs and engineers whose business it is to give it their attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>We would like to be informed whether the forts upon <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName> are bomb-proof; provided with guns of the calibre which proved so efficient at <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee">Fort Donelson</placeName>, and manned by skillful and experienced gunners; whether means have been prepared of sinking at various points of the channels heavy vessels loaded with stone, commanded by batteries on the shore, which in their turn are protected by batteries farther in their rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>In addition to these, iron-plated vessels or rafts should be speedily built, to aid in the river defence.--There is a vast quantity of old iron among housekeepers in the city and country, which would be cheerfully contributed to such a purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>We call the attention of the city authorities to this fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>We ask the special attention of our military and civil authorities to the following extracts from an article in <persName n="Blackwood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Blackwood,nomatch:0"><surname>Blackwood</surname></persName>'s <hi rend="italics">Magazine,</hi> <date value="1859-12">December, 1859</date> on the attack of the batteries of the <rs>Peiho</rs>, by the <rs>British</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>They show what can be effected against gunboats when not allowed to run by and <unclear>en lade</unclear> batteries: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> Apart from these fortifications <num value="3">three</num> barriers had been constructed where the channel was narrowest, and admirably calculated to detain vessels immediately under the fire of the works. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> The barriers were <num value="3">three</num> in number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> extended across the channel, at an elbow where the curvature of the mud banks and direction of tide placed vessels ascending the stream stern on, or in a raking position to the face of the grand battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>It consisted of a row of front stakes, <measure n="9inches" type="distance">nine inches</measure> in girth, and with a tripod base so us to preserves an upright position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The top of each stake was pointed, as well as a sharp spur, which stuck out from its sides, and at high water these dangerous pikes were hidden.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>This barrier was <measure n="550yards" type="distance">550 yards distant</measure> from the centre of the grand battery on the left, and <measure n="900yards" type="distance">900 yards</measure> from the batteries on the right. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> barrier was placed <measure n="450yards" type="distance">450 yards</measure> above the iron piles, and immediately abreast the centre of the fortifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>It consisted of <num value="1">one</num> <measure n="8inch" type="distance">eight-inch</measure> hemp and <num value="2">two</num> heavy chain cables, placed across the stream at a distance of <measure n="12feet" type="distance">twelve feet</measure> from each other; they were <sic>hove</sic> as taut as possible, and supported by large spars placed transversely at every <measure n="30feet" type="distance">thirty feet</measure>; each spar was carefully moored both up and down stream. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> The <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> barrier consisted of <num value="2">two</num> massive rafts of rough timber, lashed and cross lashed in all directions with rope and chain, and admirably moored a few feet above <num value="1">one</num> another, so as to leave a letter S opening, above which were more iron stakes, so placed as to impedes any gunboat dashing through the opening, supposing all other obstacles overcome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The ingenuity of the arrangement was most perfect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The force of the current would only-allow the passage at this point to be effected at top of high water; at the time the iron piles were covered with water, and their position being unknown, the chances were all in favor of a vessel becoming impaled upon them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> At <time value="2pm">two p. m.</time>, the <rs>Admiral</rs>, whose flag was flying on board the <rs type="ship">Plover</rs>, signalized to the <name>Opossum</name> to-remove the iron pile to which she was secured, and then to makes passage through the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> barrier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>This was accomplished in <measure n="30minutes" type="date">thirty minutes</measure>, when the <rs>Admiral</rs> led up to the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> barrier. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> * * * * * </p> 
<p> As the stern of the <name>Plover</name> touched the barrier, a single gun served as a signal to all the works, and in a minute a concentrated fire of <num value="40">forty</num> heavy pieces opened upon the little craft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>In the words of the seamen, &#x0022;It seemed as if the vessel had struck an infernal machine&#x0022; The <rs>Plover</rs> and Opossum were wreathed in smoke, above which the red flag of the gallant leader waved defiantly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> A rush and stampede of men to their quarters sounded through the flotilla, and as the <rs>Admiral</rs> throughout the signal &#x0022;engaged the enemy,&#x0022; with the red pennant under, indicating as &#x0022;close as possible,&#x0022; the cheers of the delighted ships' companies mingled with the roar of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> hearty broadside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>All day long, through that stern fight, that signal, yet significative, flew from the mast-head of the heroic <rs>Admiral</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>So well concentrated was the enemy's fire upon the space between the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> barriers, that the <name>Plover</name> and Opossum appeared struck by every shot directed at them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Within <measure n="20minutes" type="date">twenty minutes</measure> both these vessels had so many men killed and wounded, and even so shattered, as to be almost silenced. * * * * The chattered <rs>Plover</rs> almost drifted out of her honors his position, having only <num value="9">nine</num> men left efficient out of her original crew of <num value="40">forty</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The <rs>Admiral</rs>, in spite of his wounds and loss of blood, transferred his flag to the <name>Opossum</name>, and the battle raged on either hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>By <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time> the <name>Opossum</name> had become so disabled that it was necessary to drop her outside the iron piles of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> harrier, when both she and the <name>Plover</name> received fresh crews from the reserve force, and again took their share in the fight. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> * * * * No missile could fall to reach its mark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The dull <hi rend="italics">thing</hi> of the enemy's shot as it passed through a gun boat's side, the crash of wood work, the whistle of heavy splinters of wood or iron, the screaming of the wounded and the moans of the dying, mingled with the shouts of the combatants and the sharp, decisive orders of the officers &mdash; all were fighting their best. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> * * * * The <rs>Lee</rs> and Haughty were now suffering much; the fire of the boats had been most deadly. * * * By <time value="4oclock">four o'clock</time> the <rs>Lee</rs> had a hole knocked into her side, below the bow gun, out of which a man could have crawled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Both she and the <name>Draughty</name> had all their boats and top works knocked to pieces, and many shots had passed through below the water line.--Their crews were going down fast, and the space between the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> barriers was little better than a slaughter house. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> * * * * * * </p> 
<p> That post (the most advanced) was now held by the <name>Cormorant</name>, for the <rs>Lee</rs> and <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> Haughty had been obliged to retire for reinforcements and support. * * * </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> Exhaustion was beginning to tell upon our men, just at the time that the shattered condition of their vessels called for most exertion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>By <time value="6oclock">six o'clock</time> all probability of forcing the barrier with the flotilla was at an end. The <rs>Restoral</rs> was sunk and the <rs>Lee</rs> obliged to be run on the mud to prevent her going down in deep water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Many other vessels were filling, owing to shot holes; the <name>Starling</name> and Bantam aground &mdash; <placeName key="tgn,2122139" n="1.000 3" reg="plover, portage, wisconsin">Plover</placeName> disabled. * * </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/> The <rs type="role" reg="senior-Officer">senior officer</rs> saw that nothing now remained but to withdraw the squadron from the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The difficulties in the way were almost insuperable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> It wanted yet nearly <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> before darkness would set in; the passage of the bar could not be effected before dark on account of high water not occurring until <time value="12am">midnight</time>--the probabilities great against the vessels being able to find their way in the dark down so narrow and torinous a channel &mdash; and so long as the vessels remained within the bar. so long also must be in ranges of those hard hitting long guns, the effects of which they <sic>had had</sic> that day such bitter experience. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> From this we see how gunboats may be handled, when fought even in the gallant way those of <persName n="Hope,Admiral,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Hope,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Admiral">Admiral</roleName> <surname>Hope</surname></persName> were, if they are forced by obstructions to stand and take the fire of shore batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Their force consisted of <num value="11">eleven</num> gunboats, mounting <num value="30">thirty</num> guns of heavy caliber, <num value="18">eighteen</num> howitzers, and a combined rocket battery of <num value="22">twenty-two</num> <num value="12">twelve</num> and <num value="24">twenty-four</num> pounders. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Gunboats are being designed, and the necessary means to construct them have been the subject of earnest but successful appeals not only in <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>, but in <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> and in <placeName reg="Savannah, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101410">Savannah</placeName>, where the spirit has caught the prevailing excellent and has resulted thus far in opening a fair view of its final accomplishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>But the people who have taken this sudden and active part in the good cause of national defence and the construction of iron-clad ships and batteries, are not aware generally of the immense and almost insurmountable obstacles which lie in the way of its consummation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>The industry of the <rs>South</rs>, especially in all those branches connected with a marine, has been hitherto so limited that the. Government has had its energies taxed to obtain the labor sufficiently skilled to produce ships able to compete with the fleet which belonged to the old Union at the time of its disruption. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/> This cause of delay and embarrassments is <num value="1">one</num>, however, which can be remedied, and which time alone will soon do away with throughout the length and breadth of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Our resources in every other necessity of naval construction are ample, far surpassing that of any other portion of the civilized globe; our forests of oak have been the prolific source from which the navies of the old world have been created, our pines furnish the noblest spars, and the tar and turpentine has hitherto gone to supper the wants of all <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>The iron ores of the <rs>South</rs> will compare with the best, and many mines in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName> will be found to surpass in every respect the product of <placeName key="tgn,1000097" n="1.000 73" reg="sverige">Sweden</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>With all these requisites it may be asked wherein occurs the difficulty of building up the navy which we now aspire to create? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/> I have alluded to this subject solely with the object of impressing upon the <rs>Government</rs> and the people the absolute necessity of governmental protection to the iron interest, which must be festered; nay, if not inaugurated by private enterprise, must commence from the initial point under Government creation and superintendence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> It may not be known to the mass of the people that our mines are not capable, as at present conducted, to supply the exigencies of a largely increased Government demand, notwithstanding the late advertisement for an enormous supply proceeding from the <orgName n="Ordnance Department" type="department">Ordnance Department</orgName>, is sufficient indication that the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities are awake to the importance of it and the great want existing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Furthermore, the people may not be aware that at present we have not within our broad limits <num value="1">one</num> rolling mill for the manufacture of boiler-plate iron, the importance of which is sufficiently obvious to the least interested in the various manufactures of iron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>The last from which our supplies have hitherto been drawn, has fallen a prey to the flames and the destructive energies of the invader of the <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">State of Tennessee</placeName>; and now we have not on hand sufficient to render complete the repairs, after <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> use, of the engines we already possess, or may hereafter build.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>I shall only add to the number of our wants that of wrought iron, so difficult at present to obtain, and the rails which the constant service of our roads are now subjected to will demand very soon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>I have specified these, not to cause any despondence on the part of our people, but to prepare them for the urgency of governmental assistance in the creation of this branch of industry. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/> Individual enterprise has been appealed to, to remove this want, but it, must be borne in mine that the means adequate to the establishment of the necessary works must be large; and I have heard those who were willing to engage in the undertaking express the fear that the re-establishment of peace would ruin them, and destroy that which they had sacrificed much to build up for the success of our cause alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>The Government has not failed to appreciate the importance of national armories, and to that end has devoted much time and great expense in removing the <rs type="place">Harper's Ferry</rs> works, and commencing <hi rend="italics">de nove</hi> others destined to fill the existing want. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/> A cannon foundry is equally as important an object of Government aclicitude, and in view of these deficiencies and the increased demand which an iron.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/> It has been suggested, and to-day repeated in the <hi rend="italics"><rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs>,</hi> of this city, that the iron plates should be imported if our resources will not be immediately available.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>The suggestion is timely and proper; let not the <rs>Government</rs> delay, the country will demand a vigorous exertion of the power reposed in its hands, and will not fail to condemn any hesitancy in availing itself of every prerogative of power which the crisis demands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Should the <rs>Government</rs> determine to enter into this great project, it will in the first place assure itself of the possession of arm or plates sufficient to cover all the boats we may build, and that of a description superior in quality of metal to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> ships, and of a size which now is beyond the power of our Southern works, few as they are, to produce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>The additional strength which will be given to any battery by the use of plates of a size such as the <rs>Warrior</rs> is clad with will be obvious to every <num value="1">one</num> at all acquainted with construction, and at the same time facilitate the rapidity with which it can be built.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>To the <rs>Government</rs> belongs the duty of creating or (if not commencing) fostering this branch, which has risen to colossal importance within a few months, and which will be the only barrier to the accomplishment of the noble projects which the patriotism of the women of the <rs>South</rs>, as well as of the men, have inaugurated Let no impediment occur from the procrastination of the powers that be; the enthusiasm of the people must be seized at the favorable moment, or the tide will ebb, not to flow back at the beck of <rs type="role2">Secretary</rs> or <rs type="role2">President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Let the people comprehend how the case stands, and I believe they will cause the work to be done with a will, and that right soon. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/> It is not a matter, of close speculation, but <num value="1">one</num> which every reader can make out for himself, that the success of the <rs>Virginia</rs> will insure a visitation of clouds of these iron clad vessels upon our coasts, to resist which we are powerless, unless we meet them armed with the same impenetrable mail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/> Can able-bodied men have substitutes?--Legally they can; but on the grounds of patriotism and morality, as judged by obvious common sense, there can be no substitutes for the class of individuals mentioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>In the present war every interest is at stake; property of all kinds, and freedom of the person, as well as State sovereignty, are being seized upon, and human rights become null and void under the despotism of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>Under such imminent impending danger, is it the duty of only some few persons to enter the battle field?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>And, on the other hand, is it the prerogative of some select few individuals to remain in luxurious case at home?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>While theoretically these points are rejected, yet practically they have been, and are still being, carried out by multitudes in our midst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>The true ground on which every <num value="1">one</num> should stand is, that he must fight for himself if a poor man, and if possessing property his personal responsibility increases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>It is said that <persName n="Letcher,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Letcher,John,,,:1"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Letcher</surname></persName> refused to exempt a rich man because he had more to fight for than others and therefore he could not engage another person like himself &mdash; and bound to fight for himself &mdash; to be his substitute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>This desire is only prevented, by the necessity of their remaining in front of the enemy; and yet there are <num value="1000">thousands</num> at home who still insist that trained soldiers should continue in service, and, if necessary, a draft upon the balance to fill up the required number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>If drafted, these men get substitutes for money, and thus pretend to consider their obligations to their country ended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>They know better than to make this false plea; but as the law allows it, their patriotism extends no farther The law ought to be altered, and no substitute allowed to any <num value="1">one</num> owning property to a certain amount, say <measure n="5000dollars" type="currency">$5,000</measure>. Were men of property to enlist, there would be no hesitation or drawing back of the poor, and no occasion for a draft to force men to fight for their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>The principle of substitutes is a had <num value="1">one</num>, and the sooner it is abolished the better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>and in its place pass a law that no man subject to military duty can pay another for defending his person and property, while the proposed substitute is in duty bound, if able, to fight for himself, although legally absolved from so doing. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/> Having, therefore no sympathy for us, and turning with honest contempt from the hypocritical <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>, they would look with positive indifference on the contest but for their own interests involved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/> Various causes had hitherto prevented the forcible raising of the blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>In the first place when the blockade commenced to take effect, immense stocks of cotton were in the hands of the wealthiest manufacturers.--Those men had the ear of Government, and it was decidedly to their interest that the blockade should continue until their stock on hand was sold at exorbitant prices.--Government, too was the more willing to listen to them, because it was desirous of fostering the production of cotton outside of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, even at the expense of heavy temporary suffering at home. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/> <num value="1">One</num> principal ground of miscalculation here as to the blockade had been the idea that cotton is king.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>If by this is understood <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> cotton, it is a fallacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/><rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> cotton certainly plays a mighty part in the commerce of the world, but it has not absolute away, because the staple is raised too abundantly else where.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/> We have never heard of anything in the history of man like the high prices which prevail for every article of use and necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>Everybody who has anything to sell or dispose of seems to have no other thought than to wring from the wants of the purchaser the last dime that can be squeezed out from him, and to turn the screws upon the poor victim to the last point of human endurance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/><measure n="75cents" type="currency">Seventy-five cents</measure> a pound for butter, <measure n="30cents" type="currency">thirty cents</measure> for sugar, <measure n="4.5dollars" type="currency">four dollars and a half</measure> per pound for tea, <measure n="50cents" type="currency">fifty cents</measure> per quart for salt, <measure n="50cents" type="currency">fifty cents</measure> for a string of <num value="3">three</num> miserable fish, a shilling to <measure n="25cents" type="currency">twenty-five cents</measure> a pound for beef, <measure n="75cents" type="currency">seventy-five cents</measure> a peek for sweet potatoes, <measure n="40dollars" type="currency">forty dollars</measure> for an ordinary jeans coat, <num value="25">twenty-five</num> for an indifferent pair of trowsers, <num value="12">twelve</num> and <measure n="15dollars" type="currency">fifteen dollars</measure> for shoes, are only a few specimens of the gigantic oppressions which the rapacity and avarice of man are exercising on this community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>To declare gravely that there is no necessity, no reason in such prices, would be as absurd as to aver with solemnity that the sun is the source of light, that the weather is warm in summer and cold in winter, and that when a man ceases to breathe he ceases to live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>It matters not what commodity is to be disposed of, it is the same throughout.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>The wants of the distressed and of strangers especially are taken advantage of in every shape and form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>This war, which has given rise to some of the noblest examples of human nature that were ever heard of has also developed the most intense and disgusting selfishness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>Whilst the mass of the <rs>Southern</rs> people have given up everything to the war, their time, their money, their children, their own life-blood, Congress has squabbled over the amount of its pay, the <name>Legislature</name> exempted itself from military duty, the speculators and land sharks drained the soldiers who were fighting for them of their life-blood, officers sacrificed the general good to their personal jealousies, and thus marred and imperilled the noblest cause that man over drew the sword for. Of this fair structure of our young Republic, it may be said to the extortioners and speculators of every grade, as was said to their predecessors in the <rs n="Jewish" type="religion">Jewish</rs> temple, &#x0022;You have made it a den of thieves.&#x0022; Oh, for a lash of cords in some Divine hand, to scourge the whole ravenous crew from the edifice that they have polluted and almost destroyed! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/> At all events, the high prices ought to be recorded in some enduring form, with authentic testimonials, and filed among the archives of the <rs>State</rs>, in order that future generations may be enabled to believe what would otherwise appear incredible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>That such a deluge of greed and extortion should sweep over any community, and that community a Southern community, and that Southern community in the midst of a life and death struggle like this war, is absolutely astounding and appalling.--If our country falls, it will be through the accursed principle of selfishness, manifesting itself in so many forms of ambition, jealousy, and love of lucre, and making victims of the noble and generous masses who have joyfully given up their all to the cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>The heart sickens when it turns from a pure and disinterested people, whether on their farms or in the ranks, to the greedy birds of prey who darken the whole air and drown with their discordant screams for prey the groans of the suffering and even the roar of the battle. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>The suggestion to raise <measure n="150000000dollars" type="currency">$150,000,000</measure> yearly, by direct taxation, does not deceive them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>Such a possible revenue, even if it were not based upon the wild improbability that the <rs>Western States</rs> will consent to pay any such taxes, would be a very poor security for half the debt which has already accrued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>In this state of things the commercial adage, &#x0022;the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> loss is the best,&#x0022; comes into play, and the capitalists of New York are now watching for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> opportunity when it may be safe to say openly, &#x0022;This war must be settled somehow.&#x0022; </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/> This &#x0022;<num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> loss&#x0022; is indeed bad enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>Still there would be some hope if they could stop where they now are. Peace might restore to them some trade relations with the <rs>South</rs>, and while the more indolent Southerners have wealth the sharp Nor harner may always hope that he will get some of it. How the frightful current expenditure can be stopped, or how the war can be settled, it is, perhaps, premature to speculate.
