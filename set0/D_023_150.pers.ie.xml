<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> Nothing would give me more pleasure than to unite in the festival in honor of the recent victory in <unclear>Pen </unclear>; but the short notice and some personal considerations with which I <unclear></unclear> not trouble you, prevent it. Let me hope that before <unclear> </unclear> I may congratulate you on the fruit of the political success to the restoration of the <unclear>fac </unclear> Constitutional Government at the <rs>North</rs>, and an honorable peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>It is my firm belief that the paramount wish of the masses of the <rs>North</rs> in <unclear></unclear> --though timidity or considerations &mdash; mistakes in my opinion &mdash; of expediency prevent them from saying so. It has been part of the policy of the <name>Administration</name> to crush out this <unclear>cra </unclear> of a common humanity and to denounces as traitors those who think as I do; that blood enough has been shed already.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>This has been acquiesced in the long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>There are <num value="1000">thousand</num> who think with me, whose property is endangered &mdash; whose industry is paralyzed &mdash; fathers and mothers who are praying anxiously for the return of their soldiers from the battle-field or waiting for the stern doom that takes from them those who are left at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>This prayer will soon find <unclear></unclear>--and the community, weary of war and bloodshed &mdash; weary <unclear></unclear> doubt and taxation, of the tax collector and the recruiting <unclear>Se </unclear>--weary of the ambulance of the wounded and the <unclear>h </unclear>of the dead &mdash; will <unclear></unclear>with ecstasy beyond control the hour when flags of permanent trace shall be displayed at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>I am old enough to remember the peace of <dateStruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></dateStruct>, and the joy it excited; but it was nothing in <unclear> compa </unclear> with what ours will be when this brothers' war is over. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> When peace comes &mdash; or before it comes &mdash; if the <unclear></unclear> of those in power prolongs this dreary conflict &mdash; will come the day of responsibility; and part of the duty of the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> will be to enforce this stern account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>On it will devolve the duty to inquire into the conduct of this war, so far as <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> is concerned, and to know if her authorities have been faithful to their local trust.--The bitter cry of the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> <rs type="role2">Emperor</rs> for his lost legions is echoed by <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, asking why her gallant resources were sacrificed and cut to pieces on distant battle-fields, and her own frontier left open to invasion and insult.

It was bloodless by mere accident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>It was not the less discreditable because it was bloodless. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> But another outrage on the dignity and the sovereignty of the <rs>State</rs> demands inquiry and redress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>They were incarcerated in a distant prison and finally discharged without an <unclear></unclear> or any succor, and for them, our own immediate fellow citizens, no word of remonstrance or even intercession was uttered by the <rs>Executive</rs> or his advisers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> Had I no other cause for rejoicing at the restoration of Democracy to legislative power in this State, I find it in the prospect of inquiry, and, if need be, punishment of those whose neglect and indifference have inflicted there kindred ignominies on an ancient Commonwealth where the step of invasion has not been felt for more than <measure n="70years" type="date">seventy years</measure>, and where personal liberty, as secured by law, has never before been violated. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>I told him that circumstances were such as to induce me to ask him distinctly whether any action was in contemplation by <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, or by <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> conjointly with other Powers, in reference to the condition of things in our country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>He said no; that everything remained as it had done for some time past; that <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>; in common with the other Powers of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> very much regretted the war and its continuance, but they had no purpose to intervene or interfere in anyway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>I then said to him I had seen it Stated that <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName> were conferring upon the propriety of offering mediation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>He said that the wish that the war could be ended, or that something could be done, with the assent of the belligerent parties, had been spoken of, and it was yet spoken of, but nothing had been resolved upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>In further conversation he said that <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> reserved to herself the right to express this wish to the parties if it should be thought advisable to do so, or that good would grow out of it. I told him that this at once brought us back to the starting point; that the expression of such wish would be, I presumed, but an offer of mediation in another form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>He said no; if there was any word which could express less than <q>&#x0022;mediation,&#x0022;</q> that such word should be used in its place. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/> To test the character of this offer, or suggestion, which he reserved to himself the right to make, I said, <q>&#x0022;Suppose your offers, or suggestion, if made, shall be refused, what will be the consequences?&#x0022;</q> He said <q>&#x0022;nothing;&#x0022;</q> that we would be friends as we had been before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>I told him that I had just seen it stated in the <rs>English</rs> press that some such offer of mediation was to be made by the <num value="3">three</num> Powers, and, in the event of our refusal to accept it, the independence of the <rs>South</rs> was to be acknowledged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>He said that was not so; that no such consequences would follow a refusal upon our part; that things would remain as before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>I told him that we should look upon an acknowledgment of the <rs>South</rs> as but a form of intervention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>To this he assented, and said they did not think of intruding into our affairs in any way, or intervention in any form; that their intent would be comprised in the expression of a wish to be useful, if is could be done with the assent of both parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>I told him that the <rs>Emperor</rs>, at an early day, had expressed such a wish, and that he had been willing to act the part of a friend between the <num value="2">two</num>, if they should mutually request it. He said that such was yet his disposition, and nothing more, except that the calamities of civil war had increased and strengthened the wish on his pact. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/> I may add that I said to M <persName n="L'Huys,,Drouyn,de,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00050" reg="default:L'Huys,Drouyn,de,,"><foreName>Drouyn</foreName> <foreName>de</foreName> <surname>L'Huys</surname></persName>, unofficially, however, as I told him, that such an offer, if it should even he made, would come to nothing. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/> The citizens of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> have been great sufferers by the horrid devastation inflicted upon that town by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>Not only have their dwellings been destroyed, or rendered uninhabitable, but, in almost every instance, their furniture, clothing, and personal effects of every kind, have been torn to pieces or stolen, so that a community in which such a thing as poverty was once unknown is now homeless, comfortless, and, in the case of many of its inhabitants, actually requiring the assistance of others for food and lodging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>The rich inhabitants, though much impoverished, may not be thus destitute; but the rich are but a small minority of any community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>The great mass of them who have been dispossessed of their habitations and homes by the sudden convulsion which, like an earthquake, has swallowed up <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, have no surplus means to provide against such an exigency, and must, therefore, either perish for want of the absolute means of subsistence, or be relieved;--we will not say by the charity &mdash; but by the justice and humanity of their fellow-citizens. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/> That which adds immensely to the distress of a people thus ejected from their homes is the famine prices at which all articles, whether of necessity or comfort, are now held.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>If the last year, instead of being productive, had been a year of dearth, prices could scarcely range higher than they do now. How can those who have lost their furniture replace it, or even their clothing, at present prices?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>It is just as rampant in the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>The unfortunate refugees are between <num value="2">two</num> fires, with <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> behind them and <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> before them; for, of all contemptible <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> in the world, the most contemptible are those who, professing to hold <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> averice and meanness in the most sublime scorn, are themselves the meanest and most avaricious of mankind. </p>
