<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> In commencing a slight account of the capture of <placeName reg="Roanoke Island, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014345">Roanoke Island</placeName>, with the forces there, I wish to say that, so far as my opinion goes, the place was entirely indefensible, without the aid of a naval force strong enough to cope with the <rs>Federal</rs> gunboats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>In these days of diving bells and sub-marine batteries, the ordinary channel obstructions are of little avail unless protected by ships-of-war, for they can be readily removed at night after a day's fight is over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>With a clear channel, and no batteries within a mile, a gunboat will put on a full head of steam and pass the shore fortifications with chances of more than <num value="2">two</num> to <num value="1">one</num> in favor of going by them without serious injury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Taking all things into consideration, I believe that, had no force been landed upon <placeName reg="Roanoke Island, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014345">Roanoke Island</placeName>, it must have fallen inevitably in the course of a few days by cutting off communication with the main land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>It is evident to any <num value="1">one</num> who will study the position of the island and the surrounding waters, that so soon as the <rs>Federal</rs> ships passed <placeName reg="Roanoke River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,2621311">Roanoke</placeName> it was literally in the hands of the enemy, and that the more men there were upon the island the sooner must it have capitulated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>In a subsequent letter, I will give my reasons for this statement more fully, and will endeavor to convince every <num value="1">one</num> that, with the present resources of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, it is impossible to hold such a point as <placeName reg="Roanoke Island, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014345">Roanoke Island</placeName>, where a large hostile fleet can be brought, into action. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> On <date value="02-06">the 6th of February,</date> <persName n="Lynch,Commodore,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Lynch,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commodore">Commodore</roleName> <surname>Lynch</surname></persName> received intimation that <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>'s fleet was slowly feeling its way up <placeName reg="Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, North Carolina" key="tgn,1115016">Pamlico Sound</placeName>.--He at once sent the <rs>Curlew</rs> down to make a reconnaissance, and <persName n="Hunter,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Hunter</surname></persName> reported the fleet at anchor some <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure> below the island.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The evening was cloudy, misty, and very dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Judging that the fleet would advance immediately upon the approach of clear weather, <persName n="Lynch,Commodore,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Lynch,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commodore">Commodore</roleName> <surname>Lynch</surname></persName> sent word to <persName n="Shaw,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Shaw,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Shaw</surname></persName>, the commander of the island, to be ready for an engagement, on the morrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The next morning, also, was dark and misty, but our fleet was drawn up in line of battle, the flag-ship on the right and the others according to rank on the left, waiting for the approach of the enemy, when the fog cleared away. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> After a time the sun lighted up the dense masses of clouds that hung over the sounds, and soon after the wind lifted them in air, and sent them drifting seaward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>This was at <time value="10:30">half-past 10</time>, and at that hour the fleet of the enemy got under way and advanced slowly up the channel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Some <num value="20">twenty</num> gunboats came up in line of battle, with <num value="2">two</num> black steamers on either side, as flankers, some distance in advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>At <num value="11.95">11.95</num>, they arrived within about <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> of our fleet and commenced firing with rifled guns of long range and heavy calibre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Gradually falling back to bring the ships within range of the guns in the <q>&#x0022;<placeName reg="Pork Point, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2593704">Pork Point</placeName>&#x0022;</q> battery, our ships finally made a stand, and at <num value="12">12</num>. <num value="40">40</num>, commenced the fight.--Then the engagement became general, and rapid firing was kept up on both sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Our steamers joined the battery in sending defiance to the thunder of the enemy's guns. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> Meanwhile preparations were going on to make a defence on land, and word was sent to <persName n="Wise,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="nearbymention:Wise,O.,J.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName> to send over reinforcements immediately from <placeName reg="Nags Head, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2075828">Nag's Head</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>As soon as possible the <orgName type="regiment" key="59VARegiment">59th Virginia regiment</orgName>, under <persName n="Anderson,Colonel,Frank,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="default:Anderson,Frank,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <foreName>Frank</foreName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>, with <num value="2">two</num> companies of the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA46">46th Virginia</orgName>, under <persName n="Wise,Captain,O.,J.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="expanded:Wise,O.,Jennings,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>O.</foreName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName>, were embarked on barges for the island.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The fight had begun before the troops reached the point of <placeName reg="Roanoke River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,2621311">Roanoke</placeName>, and as the upper portion was rounded the whole scene burst upon the eye. Ah!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>what a beautiful sight it was!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Below, some <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> away, was our little fleet in line, and beyond was the enemy, rapidly pouring out shot and shell at them or at the batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Still farther on, just gleaming through the sunlight, was the forest of masts and the white sails of the transports, kept far in the rear out of the reach of danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The Federal gunboats fired rapidly and with great precision, the shell exploding with admirable accuracy around our little boats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>They replied spitefully and effectively, and made a most gallant and determined fight, skirmishing to the right and left to destroy the range and aim of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The guns of <placeName reg="Fort Bartow">Fort Bartow</placeName> fired slowly, but steadily, and seemed waiting for a nearer approach before turning lose all the heavy <q>&#x0022;dogs of war&#x0022;</q> that, shotted and aimed, crouched in readiness to spring upon the foe. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> The barges containing the soldiers, towed by a small steamer, ran around the point of the island towards the engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The channel at that point was tortuous and narrow, and, there being but <num value="1">one</num> approach to the landing place near <placeName reg="Fort Huger">Fort Huger</placeName>--the <orgName n="Upper Battery" type="battery">upper battery</orgName>--it was necessary to proceed with great caution to prevent being grounded on the shoal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>It became necessary to approach nearer the fight than was anticipated, and, almost before the fact became known, the barges were within range of the guns of the ships, and the shells began to explode around them at a furious rate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>About that time <persName n="Lynch,Commodore,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Lynch,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commodore">Commodore</roleName> <surname>Lynch</surname></persName> determined to skirmish to the rear behind the channel barricade, in order to draw the enemy on within a fair distance of <placeName reg="Fort Huger">Fort Huger</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>At the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> intimation of retreat the enemy's ships started forward and our boats huddled together as much as possible to protect the barges, at the same time signaling them to retire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>That moment was a fearful <num value="1">one</num> for all. The shells came <num value="1">one</num> after the other with terrible force and rapidity, their explosion ringing through the air, scattering the fragments in every direction over the water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Occasionally a large <num value="120">one hundred and twenty</num> pounder thundered across the waves, and sent its ponderous shot in the midst of the flotilla.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The air was filled with heavy reports, and the sea was disturbed in every direction by fragments of shell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>The following is an extract from a letter dated <date value="02-14">Feb. 14,</date> written by a person who witnessed the naval engagement: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>The <term type="ship">flagship</term> <rs type="ship">St. Louis</rs> took the advance, and was hugging the western shore; then came our own (the <rs>Louisville</rs>,) then the <rs>Pittsburgh</rs> and <rs>Carbondale</rs>, in order, as near side by side as was possible, in a river scarcely wide enough for <num value="2">two</num> boats to pass each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>In this order we formed a straight battery of <num value="12">twelve</num> guns in front, while the <num value="2">two</num> <term type="ship">gunboats</term>, <rs type="ship">Conestoga</rs> and <rs type="ship">Lexington</rs>, followed in our wake, pouring in their quota of missiles from their bow columbiads at a safe distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>We could see nearly every <num value="1">one</num> of our shots take effect within or near the rebel batteries, the more deadly and certain as we slowly steamed up toward them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>Thus we proceeded side by side, our fire never slackening or our determination faltering, until we arrived within <measure n="300yards" type="distance">three hundred yards</measure> of the <orgName n="Lower Battery" type="battery">lower battery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>At this time the firing on both sides was truly terrific. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>The enemy's shot and shells were screaming through the air or ravaging our sides and decks without cessation, while ours were divesting them of their more exposed batteries, ploughing up their hill sides and decimating their camps in terrible haste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>I saw <num value="1">one</num> large shell from the <rs>Louisville</rs> fall and explode directly under <num value="1">one</num> of their guns, sending a score of rebel soldiers to their long homes, demolishing the battery and scattering those not killed or wounded in indecent haste to the nearest covers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>When we had attained the last named position, viz: within <measure n="300yards" type="distance">three hundred yards</measure> of their works, we stopped our headway, and when the boats were motionless we poured in our last and most destructive fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>It really seemed at this time that the quintessence of destruction was contained in those <num value="12">twelve</num> great iron thunderers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>With each discharge a rebel gun was silenced, at each broadside a host of frightened rebels would scud up the hill to a place of safety behind the upper earthworks, and all but <num value="2">two</num> of the lower guns had ceased to deal us their destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>Now a new battery of <measure n="120l." type="pounds"><num value="120">one hundred and twenty</num> pound</measure> guns opened upon us from the left and rear of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> works. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/> We were within point blank range, and the destruction to our fleet was really terrible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/><num value="1">One</num> huge solid shot struck our boat just at the angle of the upper deck and pilot house, perforated the iron plating, passed through the heavy timbers and buried itself in a pile of hammocks just in front and in a direct line with the boilers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>Another (a shell) raked us from bow to stern, passed through the wheel-house, emerged, dropped, and exploded in the river just at our stern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>Then a <measure n="10inch" type="distance">10 inch</measure> solid shot entered our starboard how port, demolished a gun carriage, <measure n="3" type="killed">killed three</measure> men, and <measure n="4" type="wounded">wounded four</measure> others, traversed the entire length of the boat, and sunk into the river in our wake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>Then a shell came shrieking through the air, striking fair into our forward starboard port, killing another man and wounding <num value="2">two</num> more, past aft, sundering our rudder chains, and rendering the boat unmanageable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>Now we were compelled to drop astern, and leave the scene of action; but our gunners sent their respects to the rebels as long as their fire could be the least effective; and, so far as we were concerned, the battle was over. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>The surrounding country is a succession of hills, heavily timbered in places, but for the most part covered with small trees and brushwood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>This had been levelled to allow the play of artillery, but, as was subsequently found, seriously interfered with the movements of the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>In front of the fort, at a distance of half a mile or thereabouts, were our lines of entrenchments, and beyond, still further, the lines of the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/> Our troops numbered about <num value="18000">eighteen thousand</num>, and were under the command of <persName n="Floyd,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00310" reg="mostcommon:Floyd,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Generals</roleName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName>, <persName n="Pillow,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00311" reg="mostcommon:Pillow,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Pillow</surname></persName>, <persName n="Buckner,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00312" reg="nearbymention:Buckner,S.,B.,,"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Buckner</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Johnson,General,Bushrod,R.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00313" reg="default:Johnson,Bushrod,R.,,"><roleName n="General"></roleName><foreName>Bushrod</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>Most of the regiments were from <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> and <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, but <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>, also contributed their quota, and swelled the dimensions of the army to the size I have named.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>Active hostilities commenced as early as <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, but were confined to the outposts and pickets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>A battalion of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> cavalry, under command of <persName n="Forrest,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00314" reg="mostcommon:Forrest,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Forrest</surname></persName>, that day encountered a strong skirmishing party of Federals, but finally succeeded in repulsing them with considerable loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>At night, the fires of the <rs>Federal</rs> camps were plainly visible, and at dusk long lines of troops could be discerned moving into position. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/> On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> our artillery opened fire upon the enemy, and both armies prepared for serious work, but nothing in the shape of infantry encounters interrupted the cannonading, which continued during the day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/> Thursday witnessed a repetition of the events of <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>There was some fighting between the infantry and sharp shooters of both armies that were engaged in picking off those who exposed themselves to this species of certain death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>The gunboats on this day came up the river and opened a vigorous fire on <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee">Fort Donelson</placeName>; but after a severe exchanging of shots for several hours, fell back disabled. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/> Friday the cannonading was more terrible than at any time during the week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>Again the gunboats renewed their attack, and again they were compelled to retire, this time thoroughly <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">hors du combat.</hi></foreign> The infantry also engaged, and the blaze of musketry was visible along our entire lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>During the fight a desperate charge was made by <num value="2">two</num> <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> regiments upon the <orgName type="regiment" key="KY2">Second Kentucky</orgName> and <orgName type="regiment" key="TN10">Tenth Tennessee</orgName>, but they were met almost hand to hand, and sent back howling to their entrenchments, leaving a frightful proportion of their number dead and mangled upon the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>The day closed without any practical advantage to either party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>We held our own and the enemy maintained their position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>The loss was less than <num value="100">one hundred</num> on our side, principally from shell, and that of the <rs>Federals</rs> severe. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/> Saturday was the <name>Rubicon</name> of <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee">Fort Donelson</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>The enemy had received strong reinforcements during the week, and now they numbered, according to their own estimates, <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> men. Snow lay on the ground to the depth of <measure n="3inches" type="distance">three inches</measure>, and a cold, blinding sleet poured incessantly in the faces of our soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>Still, with all these odds, they faltered not. Early in the day the order came from headquarters to make a vigorous attack on the right flank of the <rs>Federal</rs> army, which, <num value="35000">thirty-five thousand</num> strong, was posted on the opposite hills, under command of <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00315" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>Not more than <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> of our men engaged in this movement, but such was the impetuosity of their advance that the enemy fled in confusion from their entrenchments. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/> Charge after charge was made by our regiments, and the ground was covered with the slain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/><measure n="300" type="prisoners">Three hundred prisoners</measure>, including several officers belonging to an Illinois regiment, <num value="4">four</num> batteries, and <num value="3500">thirty-five hundred</num> stand of arms, were captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>The former are now in a Confederate prison.--The <num value="2">two</num> latter may have been retaken, but this fact is not yet known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>Everywhere, in the earlier part of the day, our flag was victorious. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>The Federal commander finding that his right had been turned, and that the day would be lost but for some decisive effort, concentrated his troops in the afternoon on our right, and making a sudden plunge, after a long and desperate struggle redeemed his morning's loss by capturing a portion of our entrenchments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>The dead lay piled up in heaps, their gore trickling in red lines along the snow in every direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>Still our troops fought on, contesting inch by inch the ground they were compelled to vacate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>At nightfall the firing ceased, and at <time value="12oclock">twelve o'clock</time> <placeName key="tgn,6002083" n="1.000 95" reg="fort pillow, lauderdale, tennessee">Pillow</placeName> telegraphed to <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>: <q>&#x0022;The day is ours; we have repulsed the enemy with great loss to them and with considerable loss to ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>We want reinforcements.&#x0022;</q> Reinforcements were not forthcoming, however, and <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> found the <rs>Federal</rs> army strengthened by <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> fresh men, encompassing the place and completely surrounding our forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>The fight was renewed at <time value="5am">five o'clock, A. M.</time>, but it being useless to contend against such odds, the fort and army capitulated to the enemy on their own terms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>They were everywhere, animating their men, constantly under fire, and encouraging them by their example and presence.--As the regiments moved on to the charge, <persName n="Floyd,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00318" reg="mostcommon:Floyd,nomatch:0"><surname>Floyd</surname></persName> would rise in his stirrups and shout: <q>&#x0022;Be steady, boys, and aim low &mdash; fear not, the day will be ours.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>The total number of our killed and wounded is estimated at from <num value="2500">twenty-five hundred</num> to <num value="3000">three thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>That of the <rs>Federals</rs> at from <num value="4000">four</num> to <num value="6000">six thousand</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/> We had <num value="4">four</num> field batteries and several regiments of cavalry, all of which have doubtless fallen into the hands of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>The former were commanded by <persName n="Porter,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00319" reg="mostcommon:Porter,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captains</roleName> <surname>Porter</surname></persName>, <persName n="Graves,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00320" reg="nearbymention:Graves,G.,W.,,"><roleName n="Captain"></roleName><surname>Graves</surname></persName>, <persName n="Jackson,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00321" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain"></roleName><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and --. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/> To distinguish friend from foe, our men had a white band tied around the arm, and in the regiments there was carried by the side of the <rs>Confederate</rs> flag a banner of blue with a white globe in the centre. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/> As rapidly as possible the wounded were removed to the town of <placeName reg="Dover, Stewart, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098865">Dover</placeName>, above alluded to, and from thence by steamers to <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>The care bestowed upon them was excellent, there being an abundance of both physicians and refreshments. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>The enemy are represented to have fought nobly, far better than the <rs>Northern</rs> soldiers have ever fought before; but most, if not all of them, were from the <rs>West</rs>, sturdy farmers and backwoodsmen, and, like ourselves, accustomed to the use of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>The safety of <persName n="Floyd,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00322" reg="mostcommon:Floyd,nomatch:0"><surname>Floyd</surname></persName> and <persName n="Pillow,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00323" reg="mostcommon:Pillow,nomatch:0"><surname>Pillow</surname></persName>, with a portion of their command, is beyond doubt.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/> Had reinforcements been sent forward, so that <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> fresh men could have stood the brunt of the battle on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time>, instead of our jaded soldiers, <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee">Fort Donelson</placeName> would not have fallen; but the lack of this effective strength enabled the enemy to completely hem our little army in, and extend their lines in crescent shape from river bank to river bank around us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>The news of the surrender reached <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville, Tenn.</placeName>, by telegraph, on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> about church time, while many of the citizens were on their way to their accustomed places of worship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>Instantly, of course, every other consideration gave place to the thought of personal safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>Every means of transportation at hand was employed to remove furniture and valuables; the depots were thronged with men, women and children, anxious to leave the city; train after train was put in motion; Government stores were thrown open to all who chose to carry them away, and negroes, <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> laborers, and even genteel looking persons, could be seen <q>&#x0022;toting&#x0022;</q> off their pile of hog, clothing, or other property belonging to the army, though, by order of the military authorities, much of this was recovered on the ensuing day. In a single word, the city was crazy with a panic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/>Still there were some in the city who manifested a determination to make a stand and apply the torch to every house before it should be surrendered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/>This state of affairs lasted, without much modification until <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time>, when the excitement began to subside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/>All the rolling stock of the railroads converging in <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName> was brought into requisition, and the machinery in the <rs type="place">Armory</rs>, guns, and much valuable provisions. </p> <milestone unit="column" n="7"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/> As soon as it was supposed that the enemy were advancing &mdash; in fact, early <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>--a meeting of prominent citizens was held and a committee of gentlemen, consisting of <persName n="Brown,Ex-Governor,E.,S.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00327" reg="default:Brown,E.,S.,,"><roleName n="Ex-Governor">Ex-Governor</roleName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>, <persName n="Ewing,the Honorable,Andrew,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00328" reg="default:Ewing,Andrew,,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">Hon.</roleName> <foreName>Andrew</foreName> <surname>Ewing</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Ewing,the Honorable,Edwin,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00329" reg="default:Ewing,Edwin,,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">Hon.</roleName> <foreName>Edwin</foreName> <surname>Ewing</surname></persName>, decided that the surrender should be made only on condition that private persons and property should be respected; but these terms had not, at the latest advices, been submitted to the <rs>Federal</rs> commander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>The following day, owing to the non-arrival of the gunboats and reinforcements sent by water, no attack was made; but the investment was extended on the flanks of the enemy, and drawn closer to his works, with skirmishing all day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>The remaining <num value="2">two</num> were very much disabled also, having received a number of heavy shots about the pilot house and other parts of the vessels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>He was very weak, however, during the morning, and had it not been for the free administration of <unclear>stimulants,</unclear> it would have been necessary to carry him to the gallows. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/> The body remained suspended <measure n="27minutes" type="date">twenty-seven minutes</measure>, and at the end of that time, life having been pronounced extinct, the corpse was lowered and placed in a coffin, preparatory to being delivered over to his friends. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/><num value="1">One</num> of the points insisted on for the defence of the unhappy <rs>Nathaniel</rs> was, that his nativity was not proved to be <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs>, as he was born at sea, and in <name>British</name> waters, under the <rs>British</rs> flag. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>It is said &mdash; how truly we do not know &mdash; that on <num value="1">one</num> occasion, when he was leaving the coast of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>, with a cargo of slaves, he was pursued by a British man-of-war, his vessel was captured, and <persName n="Gordon,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00446" reg="nearbymention:Gordon,Nathaniel,,,"><surname>Gordon</surname></persName> escaped in female attire. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/>He received them in a most affectionate manner, and spoke most tenderly of his little son, who was absent &mdash; He seemed to care little about his own fate, but for the well-being of his wife and child be appeared most solicitous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>The idea of dying a felon's death, and the stigma that would naturally rest upon his innocent off-spring, overwhelmed him with grief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>Even the <unclear> </unclear> were moved to compassion, and the sobs of the broken-hearted wife found an echo in every breast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>The final separation took place about <time value="7oclock">seven o'clock</time>, and is said to have been a most painful scene to all within hearing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/> About <time value="3am">3 o'clock A. M.</time>, the keepers of the prison were alarmed by <persName n="Gordon,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00449" reg="nearbymention:Gordon,Nathaniel,,,"><surname>Gordon</surname></persName> being suddenly seized with convulsions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> it was supposed that he was trying to strangle himself, but, on a close examination, it was evident that he was suffering from the effects of poison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>He became quite rigid, his pulse could scarcely be felt, and it was thought that after all the gallows would be cheated of its victim; but, finally, by means of the stomach pomp and the use of brandy, the patient was sufficiently recovered to be able to articulate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/>It was not until <time value="8oclock">eight o'clock</time>, however, that the physicians had any hope of saving <persName n="Gordon,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00450" reg="nearbymention:Gordon,Nathaniel,,,"><surname>Gordon</surname></persName>'s life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>From that hour the prisoner gradually recovered, although he was subject to fainting <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> for hours afterwards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/>When sensible, he begged of the doctors to let him alone, preferring, he said, to die by his own hand rather than suffer the ignominy of a public execution. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/> A few minutes after <time value="11oclock">eleven o'clock</time>, when it was apparent to <persName n="Gordon,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00451" reg="nearbymention:Gordon,Nathaniel,,,"><surname>Gordon</surname></persName> that the execution would certainly take place, notwithstanding his attempt at suicide, he sent for <persName n="Murray,Marshal,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00452" reg="mostcommon:Murray,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Marshal">Marshal</roleName> <surname>Murray</surname></persName>, and said he had something of a private nature to communicate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>The <rs>Marshal</rs>, with becoming alacrity, repaired to the bedside of the culprit, and asked if anything could be done to alleviate his sufferings <persName n="Gordon,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00453" reg="nearbymention:Gordon,Nathaniel,,,"><surname>Gordon</surname></persName> raised himself slowly from his cot, and with much difficulty said: <unclear> </unclear> Cut a lock of hair from my head and give it to my wife.&#x0022; Then taking a ring from his flagger, he requested was <sic>that that</sic> also should be sent to his wife in remembrance of her husband.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>The request was cheerfully complied with, and the official, quite overcome with emotion, left the unhappy man to his fate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/> As the fatal moment drew nigh, the excitement of the spectators was only equalled by their sympathy for the condemned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/>At <time value="11:30oclock">half past 11 o'clock</time> <persName n="Dean,Judge,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00454" reg="mostcommon:Dean,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Dean</surname></persName>, <num value="1">one</num> of <persName n="Gordon,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00455" reg="nearbymention:Gordon,Nathaniel,,,"><surname>Gordon</surname></persName>'s counsel, gained admittance to the prison, and seeking <persName n="Murray,Marshal,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00456" reg="mostcommon:Murray,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Marshal">Marshal</roleName> <surname>Murray</surname></persName>; informed the latter that <persName n="Morgan,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00457" reg="mostcommon:Morgan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Morgan</surname></persName> had interceded for the prisoner, and had telegraphed to the <rs>President</rs> asking for a respite <persName n="Dean,Judge,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00458" reg="mostcommon:Dean,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Dean</surname></persName> begged that the execution might not come off until the last moment, with the hope of a reprieve being granted; but the <rs>Marshal</rs> was inexorable, and said the sentence of the <rs type="place">Court</rs> should be carried into execution at <time value="12pm">noon</time>. <persName n="Dean,Judge,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00459" reg="mostcommon:Dean,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Dean</surname></persName> urged that a reprieve might be on its way from the <rs>President</rs>, and cautioned the official not to exercise too much haste, but in vain. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/> All being in readiness, <persName n="Draper,Mister,Simeon,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00460" reg="default:Draper,Simeon,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Simeon</foreName> <surname>Draper</surname></persName> volunteered to notify <persName n="Gordon,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00461" reg="nearbymention:Gordon,Nathaniel,,,"><surname>Gordon</surname></persName> that the fatal moment had arrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>The culprit seemed surprised that the execution should take place so soon, it being only <time value="12:10oclock">ten minutes past twelve o'clock</time>, and said, <q>&#x0022;I thought it was not to take place until <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time>.&#x0022;</q> Whereupon <persName n="Draper,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00462" reg="nearbymention:Draper,Simeon,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Draper</surname></persName> informed him that the change in the time had been brought about by his attempt at suicide, and that he must prepare to die. The prisoner then said that it was hard to die a felon's death, and made some incoherent remarks about the injustice of his sentence and the unfair manner in which he had been treated by the <orgName n="U. S. District Attorney" type="org">United States District Attorney</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>He stated that the <rs type="role" reg="District Attorney">District Attorney</rs> had promised to use his influence with the <rs>President</rs> to procure a commutation of his sentence; but, instead of doing so, he urged all he could against it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/> As the procession moved through the yard all eyes were fixed upon the condemned who tottered to the <unclear>scaffold</unclear> like a man half dead with fear or stupefied with liquor, it is hard to say which.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/>The feebleness of the culprit, the agony with which he viewed the preparations which had been made for his execution, the solemn and careworn appearance of the <rs>Marshal</rs> and his deputies, the presence of the military drawn up in line, all contributed to render the scene a most impressive and painful <num value="1">one</num>.
