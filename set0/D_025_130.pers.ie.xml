<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> The Confederates have sustained to-day the most ignominious defeat of the whole war &mdash; a defeat for which there is but little excuse or palliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>For the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time during our struggle for national independence our defeat is chargeable to be troops themselves, and not to the blunders or incompetency of their leaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>It is difficult for me to realize how a defeat so complete could have occurred on ground so favorable, notwithstanding the great disparity in the forces of the <num value="2">two</num> hostile armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The ground was more in our favor than it was at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, where <persName n="Longstreet,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Longstreet</surname></persName> is said to have estimated that <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> was equal to <num value="300000">300,000</num> men.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> But let us take up the painful narrative at the beginning, and see how this great misfortune, if not this grievous disgrace, has be fallen the <rs>Confederate</rs> arms. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>It was found necessary to extend his right well up towards the <rs>Chickamauga</rs>, near its month, in consequence of the heavy forces which the enemy had thrown up the river in that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The <rs type="place">Tennessee and Missionary Ridge</rs> approach nearer in each other as <num value="1">one</num> goes up, or rather down the valley the width of which at some points does not exceed <num value="1">one</num> <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> of a mile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Across this valley, how almost an open plain, varying from a <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> of a mile to <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> in width, the <rs>Federals</rs> advanced to the assault, their ranks exposed to an artillery fire from the ridge while in the plain, and to the infantry fire when they attempted the ascent at the hill or mountain. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> The only objection that can be urged against our line was its length and weakness, the latter being the result of the former, and the former the result of circumstances beyond our control, it being necessary for as to guard the passes in the <rs type="place">Ridge</rs> and to uniform to the length of the line presented by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The ridge varies in height from <num value="4">four</num> to <measure n="600feet" type="distance">six hundred feet</measure>, and is crossed by several roads leading out from <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The western side next to the enemy was steep and rugged, and in some places almost bare, the timber having been cut away for firewood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Our pickets occupied the breast works below, while the infantry and artillery were distributed along the crest of the ridge from <placeName reg="McFarlan's Gap">McFarlan's Gap</placeName> almost to the mouth of the <placeName reg="Chickamauga river">Chickamauga</placeName>, a distance of <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure> or more.--In addition to the natural strength of the position we had thrown up breastworks along the ridge wherever the ascent is easy. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Had these been present with their steady leader at the head of them, we should have won a victory gone as complete as our defeat has been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>As it was we ought to have won the day, and should had done so if our men had done as well as usual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Possibly a mistake was committed when <persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName> was sent away, and possibly it would have been better not to have accepted battle to-day, but have retired last night.

But what could he expect from a battle where the odds were so much against him?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Not only did <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> have <num value="3">three</num> to <num value="1">one</num> in numbers, but the geographical configuration of the ground, in man&#x0153;uvering an army, was as favorable as he could desire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Nature had provided an ample protection for his flanks and rear, and rendered his front almost impregnable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>He possessed the additional advantage of bring able to man&#x0153;uvre his army upon the cord of a semi-circle, whilst <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,Branton,,,:1"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName> could move only upon the arc. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> But let us proceed with the battle, the strangest, and singular and unsatisfactory conflict in which our arms have been engaged. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/> When things get to their worst, they generally begin to brighten a little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>Our affairs in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> wear, certainly, a more cheerful aspect than they have done since the <rs n="Battle of Chickamauga" type="battle">battle of Chickamauga</rs>, <measure n="2.5months" type="date">two months and a half</measure> ago. The splendid achievement of <persName n="Cleburne,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00204" reg="nearbymention:Cleburne,Pat,,,"><surname>Cleburne</surname></persName> proves that there is spirit left in the army &mdash; enough of it, if properly fostered and directed, to accomplish great things, in spite of late disasters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>The victory in question is a great comfort &mdash; the retreat of the enemy, and the apparent postponement of his advance upon <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> is a greater. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/> It is a great satisfaction to the country to know that <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00205" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Branton,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName>'s desire to be recalled has been compiled with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>We have no doubt that <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00206" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Branton,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName> is a brave soldier and a true patriot, and that he has done the best he could do. No blame ought to be attached to him, for he has felt for a long time that he was in a false position, and has repeatedly desired to be recalled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>That wish ought long since to have been complied with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>It was cruel to keep him in a position which was painful to him, and in which he seems to have been conscious that he would acquire nothing but disgrace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>No General who has entirely lost the confidence of his officers and his men can succeed in any enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>If he merely remain passive, without undertaking anything, he is almost sure to be followed up by his enemy, and to incur defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/><persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00207" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Branton,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName> ought to have been removed long since.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>He had been guilty of the greatest crime that can be laid to the charge of a soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>He had been unfortunate &mdash; whether as a just consequence of his own management, it matters not. He bore with him the taint of that original sin, which soldiers are not apt to forgive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>If <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00209" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Branton,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName> had been the greatest <rs>Captain</rs> that ever wore a sword, it would have been unjust to him and to his soldiers to have retained him in command. </p>

He is in the very prime of life, about <measure n="45years" type="date">forty-five years</measure> of age, in full possession of his faculties, in excellent health, prompt, energetic, and daring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>He graduated in <dateStruct value="1838--"><year reg="1838">1838</year></dateStruct>, and was several times breveted during the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> war for gallantry and meritorious conduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>He has been in constant service during this war, and has participated in as many battles perhaps as any man in it. In all of them he has conducted himself with distinguished valor, and it is said that his cool courage and admirable judgment were eminently conspicuous in the retreat after the late disastrous battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>He is believed, moreover, to possess, in a high degree, the regard and confidence of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>Such is his character as it has been represented to us. We merely state what we have heard, and know nothing of our own knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>We have not the smallest doubt that he will be able to restore the discipline of the army, and successfully resist the farther advance of the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/> Although the news is in general so cheering, there is still a very natural anxiety felt about <persName n="Longstreet,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00212" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>It is evident, therefore, that <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName> is the destination of these troops, who are marching on the south side of the river and of the railroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>The same telegram says that <persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00215" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName> has been reinforced by <persName n="Buckner,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00216" reg="mostcommon:Buckner,nomatch:0"><surname>Buckner</surname></persName> and another division.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>We have hopes, therefore, that he may be strong enough to meet the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> on equal terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>But our principal hope lies in the celerity of his siege operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/><placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName> being taken he can then turn upon those who came to relieve it. It is probable that the danger of <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName> may have caused the retreat to <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, as well as <persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00217" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><surname>Meade</surname></persName>'s retreat across the <rs>Rapidan</rs>. </p>
