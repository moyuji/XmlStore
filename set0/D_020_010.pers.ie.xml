<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> I am constrained to express surprise to see so little mention made of, and attention bestowed upon, that most magnificent phenomenon that has so suddenly made its appearance in the <rs>Northern</rs> heavens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>It was noticed by us for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time about <time value="11:30">half-past 11</time> <time>yesterday</time> evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>At that early hour it displayed but little of that brilliant appendage which a few hours later streamed far out, reaching far beyond the zenith, and holding the delighted looker-on perfectly entranced by its grandeur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>I know of nothing so soothing to the feelings, and at the same time so well calculated to elevate the mind of man above terrestrial objects and sordid considerations, and gently, yet surely, drawing and fixing it on things above, as a contemplation of the glorious heavens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>What can surpass in loveliness or sublimity a clear blue sky bedecked with countless myriads of shining orbs &mdash; some in great and picturesque modesty holding themselves in the distant background, and from their far-off positions shedding mild and genial rays upon us, whilst others, more bold, send forth floods (so to speak) of celestial radiance, and standing out in bold relief against the dark blue vault?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>But how much must even such a scene as this be heightened in grandeur, when a magnificent comet of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> magnitude burst suddenly into full view, holding not only the astonished gazer in deep awe, but even drawing reverence from the stars themselves, as they behold for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time his unheralded presence among them, with his brilliant train almost spanning the heavens, and before whose splendor the host of stars seem to pale?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Its immense trail covered a space of not less than <num value="85">eighty-five</num> degrees of the heavens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>This would give an actual length of <num value="148">148</num> <measure n="750000miles" type="distance">750,000 miles</measure>. When <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> seen, the comet seemed about <num value="30">thirty</num> degrees above the horizon, and its position was between the right hand star in the <q>&#x0022;Dipper&#x0022;</q> and the <orgName n="North Star" type="newspaper">North star</orgName>, considerably nearer the former. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> Every <num value="1">one</num> is doubtless extremely anxious to know the name and orbit of this grand celestial visitor, and we suppose the astronomers will soon favor us with that information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>It is particularly adapted to the condition of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>Many of the people of that State have advocated strict neutrality between the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs>, believing, that they would be enabled to keep themselves free from the controversy, and save their State from the horrors of war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/> The <orgName n="State Legislature" type="legislature">Legislature of the State</orgName> adopted resolutions declaring that <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> would remain neutral in the contest, and would not permit the passage of troops over her soil from another party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>The Governor, in accordance with these resolution, issued a proclamation warning both parties from violating this neutrality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>Inasmuch as all of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00048" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abe,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s acts were gross usurpations of power and clearly in derogation of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> had a perfect right to assume this position, because any allegiance she owes to the <rs>Federal Government</rs> is under and by virtue of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and when that is violated and disregarded, she is at perfect liberty to refuse obedience to an unconstitutional authority. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/> But it was a delusion to suppose that the usurper would respect this neutrality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>Assuming that, while a State remains in the <rs>Union</rs>, it is bound to obey all its edicts, no matter how arbitrary or unconstitutional, he claims perfect allegiance and demands the right to prosecute hostilities against the <rs>Southern States</rs>, across <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> soil.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/> The objection to it, as thus stated, is that it will prevent <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00049" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abe,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> from carrying on a war of invasion against States which lie beyond the neutral territory.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/> The proportion of Tories in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> is about the same as it was in <dateStruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>The history of their prototypes had no terrors for the <name>Tories</name> of the present struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>The spirit and conduct of these are after the example set by their odious predecessors in the times that tried men's souls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>The infamy of their course is, indeed, much greater; for the allegiance of the colonies <hi rend="italics">was</hi> due the <rs>King</rs>, according to then received maxims, and the contest was much more a contest of principle than of feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>The people of the colonies were warmly and affectionately attached to those of the mother country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>They were in the habit of thinking and speaking of the old country as <q>&#x0022;home,&#x0022;</q> and their fondest sentiments were centred upon the scenes and people of fatherland. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/> The Revolution of <dateStruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></dateStruct> cost the colonists a struggle of feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>They loved <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and were bound by a <num value="1000">thousand</num> ties to her people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>Unlike the <rs>North</rs> to the <rs>Southerner</rs>, <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> was no less their country than <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>.--There was not <num value="1">one</num> sentiment of repulsion or antagonism between the <num value="2">two</num> peoples.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>All was affection, kindness, and mutual attachment.--<placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> was then unfortunately cursed by the most imbecile, corrupt, and unscrupulous Government which that often misruled empire ever knew before, and by a King who, although endowed with some few good qualities as a ruler, was yet, on the whole, <num value="1">one</num> of the worst <rs>Kings</rs> and <num value="1">one</num> of the worst men who ever sat upon a throne. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/> The quarrel of the colonies was with the <rs>King</rs> and his Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>It was not with the people of Britain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>The policy of the <rs>Government</rs> towards them had always been narrow and injurious; and now it had begun to be tyrannical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>Under great statesmen, like <hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName reg="Chatham, Kent, England" key="tgn,7011586">Chatham</placeName>, </hi> under less arbitrary kings, like the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> monarchs of the <rs type="place">House of Hanover</rs>, whose interests impelled them to conciliation; and during the pressure of the great wars that had taxed the energies of the <rs>Empire</rs>, the colonies complained but little of the policy of the home government; but when the government fall into such hands as the <hi rend="smallcaps">Graftons, </hi> Rockinghams and <hi rend="smallcaps">Norths;</hi> when peace had succeeded to war; when the violent temper of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><foreName>George</foreName> <genName n="3">III</genName></persName>.,</hi> which was the beginning of his insanity, began to wreak itself upon the colonies, and hatch and unnecessary measures of oppression began to be put into practice by the <rs>Government</rs>, then it was that the colonists began to take measures for separation and independence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/> Their quarrel was altogether with the <rs>King</rs>, his ministers, and with Parliament which was then not a Parliament elected by the people but a Parliament virtually appointed by the <rs type="place">Court</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>It was the <rs>Government</rs> and the <rs>Government</rs> alone that was the oppressor of the <name>Colonies</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>The people of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> did not approve its policy nor sympathize with its temper. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/> Nothing, therefore, could have been more natural than the fact that a large class of the colonists should, disregarding the conduct of the <rs>British Government</rs>, and cherishing an affectionate attachment for the home country itself, refuse to take up arms against it. Nor is it to be forgotten that the old notions of the divine right of kings and of perpetual and inalienable allegiance were then predominant in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>There is no doubt that many good men were conscientiously Tories, looked upon revolution as a sin and a crime, and opposed it from pure motives of religion and patriotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>The judgment of their contemporaries was severe upon them, and they very often underwent a fate as summary as ignominious; but in later times the judgment of the country, though it cannot forgive, has been less severe on their conduct, and the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> mind has been disposed, in some sort, to excuse their mere Toryism where it did not assume the form of active hostility to their own flesh and blood and native soil. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/> But, notwithstanding these palliating considerations, which all now acknowledge, the name of Tory is still the name most odious to the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> ear, and execrable to the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>If the judgment of the country be thus severe upon the men who refused to make common cause with their countrymen against the <rs>Government</rs> and people of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, what must it be upon the <name>Tories</name> of '<num value="61">61</num>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>The quarrel of the <rs>South</rs> is not with the <name>Governments</name> of the <rs>North</rs> and their minions' but with the people of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>It is not the <rs>Washington Government</rs> alone that has trampled under foot their constitutional rights; but it is the <rs>Northern</rs> people who, for <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure>, by acts of every day, and by insults in every form, have outraged and injured them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>The cruel and inhuman war that is now waged against them, is <num value="1">one</num> urged and forced upon the <rs>Government</rs> by the people of the <rs>North</rs>, who are the real and the bitterest enemies and haters of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>Nor is there any shadow of right of divine rule pretended for the <rs>Government</rs> at this culightened day. The superstitions of the last century on that subject are banished even in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/> The doctrine of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> continent is, that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> allegiance of the citizen is due to the <rs>State</rs>; and that he is bound to support the <rs>Federal Government</rs> only when it observes the provisions of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>There is, therefore, neither the sense of duty to the <rs>Government</rs>, which by the act of the seceding States has become a foreign <num value="1">one</num>, nor of affection for the people of the <rs>North</rs>, to tempt or excuse the <rs>Southern Tery</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>His taking sides with the <rs>North</rs> against the <rs>South</rs> is an act of pure meanness and beastly treason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>The men who will espouse the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> side of this controversy, would join the negroes in an insurrection; for hearts that are black enough to sympathize with <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are depraved enough to make common cause with slaves. --Indeed, the sequel will show that these men, if ever the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> gain a foothold in a slaveholding region of country, will make common cause with them, the free negroes and the slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>Compared with the <name>Tory</name> of '<num value="61">61</num>, the <name>Tory</name> of <dateStruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></dateStruct> was a patriot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>The saltpetre and sulphur are <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> refined, the former by solving in water and the latter by fusing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>Each of the ingredients are then ground to powder and bolted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>They are then carefully weighed and mixed in a trough made for the purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>The compound is then put into the mill, <measure n="50pounds" type="mass">50 lbs.</measure> at a time, which is made of <num value="2">two</num> revolving cast-iron rollers of <num value="3">three</num> tons weight, revolving on a cast-iron plate, and ground <measure n="3hours" type="date">three hours</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/> Nearly <measure n="80years" type="date">eighty years</measure> ago, <num value="2">two</num> <rs n="Mohegan" type="nativeamerican">Moravian</rs> missionaries, stationed in <placeName reg="Labrador" key="tgn,7013071">Labrador</placeName>, at a place called <placeName reg="Nain, Frederick, Virginia" key="tgn,2113169">Nain</placeName>, set out on a journey in a sledge, over the ice, to <num value="1">one</num> of their settlements further North.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>Their sledge was drawn by dogs, and driven by an Esquimaux <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs>.--Another sledge followed, in which were other natives who were friends of the missionaries; and among them were a woman and her child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>They had <measure n="150miles" type="distance">one hundred and fifty miles</measure> to go, which they expected to accomplish in about <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure>, as most of the way was over the frozen sea, and the sledges ran with ease, and the dogs were fresh and in full vigor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/> After they had journeyed some, hours, and were a long distance from the shore, upon the clear, glistening ice that covered the ocean, they met a sledge containing some strange Esquimaux <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indians</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>These natives were hastening for the land as rapidly as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>They barely stopped a moment, and advised the missionaries to return at once to the shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>They gave no reasons for their advice; and as the missionaries could see no cause for returning, it was not heeded by them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>The weather was fair; hardly a cloud was seen in the sky; the frozen ocean, as far as the eye could reach, was motionless as though the treacherous waves beneath were chained forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>Not many moments passed, however, before their driver thought he perceived what was called a ground-swell under the ice. He jumped from his sledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>Lying down, he placed his ear upon the frozen surface.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>He then distinctly heard a hollow grating and roaring noise, that seemed as if ascending from the abyss beneath. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/> The travelers now quickened the pace of their dogs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>Soon the motion of the sea under the ice was more perceptible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>The drivers turned for the shore, and urged the dogs to their utmost speed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/> The ground-swell increased so much that the vast body of ice, upreared by a troubled ocean beneath, heaved fearfully in many places, and rose slowly like gathering waves; the sledges no longer moved swiftly and smoothly along, but could with difficulty be preserved from overturning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>It soon appeared evident that the ice would burst midway between them and the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>As they neared the coast, the prospect before them was truly terrific; the ice was grinding and breaking into a <num value="1000">thousand</num> pieces against the precipices, with a tremendous noise, which, added to the raging of the wind and the snow storms driving about in the air, utterly prevented their hearing or seeing anything distinctly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>It was with the utmost difficulty the terrified dogs could be urged onward amid the rising and falling of the icy sea. The drivers paused a few seconds, in a kind of mute despair; then, seizing the critical moment, when the trembling mass dashed wildly to the level of the coast, they drove their sledges furiously along it, and succeeded in their hazardous attempt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/> They had hardly time to look around them after gaining the land, when that part of the ice from which they had just made their escape burst asunder, and the water forced itself in from below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>In an instant the whole frozen mass, in the wildest imaginable ruin, broke loose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>The vast surface as far as the eye could reach, was crumbling, crushing, piling, and tossing itself madly, amidst a clamor utterly indescribable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>The missionaries were overwhelmed with amazement at their marvellous escape; and even the pagan <rs>Esquimaux</rs> expressed gratitude to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> on account of their deliverance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/> After remaining <measure n="6days" type="date">six days</measure> in this miserable place, they resolved to return to <placeName reg="Nain, Frederick, Virginia" key="tgn,2113169">Nain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>There was no way to effect this but <num value="1">one</num>; and their Esquimaux driver ran forward as a kind of pioneer to find the track.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>The brethren followed with their sledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>It was a weary, fearful journey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>They made a last meal of the remainder of their provisions; and by dint of boldness and skill arrived at <placeName reg="Nain, Frederick, Virginia" key="tgn,2113169">Nain</placeName>, to the great joy of the whole settlement, and especially of their own families, who had been reduced almost to despair of ever beholding them again. </p>
