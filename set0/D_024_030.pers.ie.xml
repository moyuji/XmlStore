<head>The Terrors of the sea &mdash; Career of the <rs>Florida</rs> &mdash; description of her officers and style.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> papers have a new sensation in the <rs>Florida</rs> and <num value="2">two</num> Confederate sailing privateers, which are just out &mdash; the <rs>Retribution</rs> and <rs>Dixie</rs> &mdash; These sailing vessels are schooners of about <num value="150">150</num> tons, both painted black.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The captain and crew of the <term type="ship">brig</term> <rs type="ship">Estelle</rs>, which was destroyed by the <rs>Florida</rs>, have arrived in New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The <rs>Estelle</rs> was bound for <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, with sugar and honey, and <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> descried the <rs>Florida</rs> on the <dateStruct value="--19"><day reg="19">19th ult.</day></dateStruct>, off <placeName reg="Cape Antonio">Cape Antonio</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The following is a description by her <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> mate of the <rs>Florida</rs>'s style of taking prizes: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The brig was all the time under close reefed sails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/><persName n="Brown,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Brown,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>, her commander, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thought the stranger might be the <rs>Alabama</rs>; but, as she had the <orgName n="Stars and Stripes" type="newspaper">Stars and Stripes</orgName> flying, this opinion gave way to the belief of her being a Federal cruiser. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> Shortly before <time value="3pm">3 o'clock P. M.</time> the steamer, which had come up abreast of the brig to a distance of <measure n="75yards" type="distance">75 yards</measure>, fired a shot across her bows, and lowering the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> flag ran up that of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Her guns were brought to bear on the <rs>Estelle</rs>, whose captain thus was made aware of his fate.--The <rs>Estelle</rs> at once backed her topsail and hove to, when <num value="5">five</num> boats were lowered from the <name n="Confederate States">Confederate</name> steamer and pulled towards the doomed brig.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-2">second lieutenant</rs> of the <rs>Florida</rs> stopped on board, and respectfully saluting the captain, remarked, &#x0022;<rs type="role2">Captain</rs>, you are a prize to the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Pack up your private properly with all dispatch and let your crew do the same.&#x0022; This order was at once complied with, when the crew were ordered on board the steamer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The lieutenant sent the chronometer, charts and instruments of the brig on board the steamer, and selected from the ship chandlery stores and cargo such articles as were wanted on the steamer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>He then set his crew to work in stripping the brig of part of her rigging, all her sails, except foretopgallantsail, royal and mainstaysail and foretopstaysail, which were sent en board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>A fire was then kindled on the deck, both fore and aft, and in a few minutes the brig was a mass of flame. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> When the crew of the brig arrived on the steamer, they were at once informed by the <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-1">first lieutenant</rs> that they would be treated as prisoners of war, and allowed the liberty of the ship, provided they would conform to the rules of the vessel.--They were divided among the crew of the steamer as messmates, and had the same fare as their captors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The captain of the brig was at once invited to partake of the hospitalities of the cabin, and a <rs n="state room" type="product">state-room</rs> was at once arranged for himself and mate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> male was sent to mess with the subaltern officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The fare of the officers and crew of the <rs>Florida</rs> was nearly the same &mdash; salt beef, peas, and rice, with an allowance of hard bread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The officers, however, said that in <placeName reg="La Habana, Ciudad de la Habana, Cuba" key="tgn,7006453">Havana</placeName> they would be fully supplied with all necessaries for a long cruise. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The officers of the <rs>Florida</rs> treated their prisoners with great delicacy and kindness and, during frequent conversations on the war, regretted, with tears in their eyes, that the stern necessities of war obliged them to fight their brethren of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>They are mostly ex- officers of the navy, and exact the same discipline of their crew as on the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> men- of-war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>No profane or insulting language is allowed, and the offender punished severely. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>He is said to be very proficient in his business. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The officers of the <rs>Florida</rs> state that they ran out of <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName> on a clear, starlight night, with a fresh breeze, and that they ran past <num value="7">seven</num> Federal gunboats, none of which fired a single shot at them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>They were chased until next morning by <num value="2">two</num> gunboats, but then they left their pursuers far astern and hull down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The crew is a mixture of all nationalities, but the <rs>English</rs> and <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> element predominates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>There is also <num value="1">one</num> Chinaman on board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Most of the crew have been prisoners of war at the <rs>North</rs>, and some of them were in <placeName reg="Fort Columbus">Fort Columbus</placeName>, or in the <name>Pea</name>-Patch, near <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>They are well drilled in the use of the guns, and are far superior to many of our merchant crews. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The <placeName reg="La Habana, Ciudad de la Habana, Cuba" key="tgn,7006453">Havana</placeName> correspondent of the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName> writing on the <dateStruct value="--23"><day reg="2">23d</day></dateStruct>, says that the <rs>Florida</rs> was in that port, having been chased up to the very walls of <placeName reg="Moro Castle">Moro Castle</placeName> by the <rs>Mobile</rs> blockadeing squadron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>He is vigorous, energetic, bold, quick, and dashing, and the sooner he is caught and hung the better will it be for the interests of our commercial community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>He is decidedly popular here, and you can scarcely imagine the anxiety evinced to get a glance at him. He was at the <name>Dominico</name> this morning in citizen's clothes, and was the observed of every <num value="1">one</num>.

<head>Parties in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/> The difference between the <num value="2">two</num> parties in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> seems simply <num value="1">one</num> as to the mode of prosecuting the war, not, so far as we have been able to discover, as to the war itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>We are aware that the <orgName n="Republican Press" type="newspaper">Republican press</orgName> charge the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> with being allies of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, and seeking to bring about a peace on the basis of the recognition of Southern Independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>But we have yet to see a single particle of evidence adduced in support of that proposition.--It is nothing but a political accusation, intended to make capital for party effect against the <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>The party accused stoutly denies the charge, and protests its unfaltering devotion to &#x0022;the <orgName n="Stars and Stripes" type="newspaper">Stars and Stripes</orgName>.&#x0022; The denial is entitled to at least as much credit as the accusation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>The war has been carried on hitherto by Democratic capital and Democratis men, in greater proportion to the numbers of the <num value="2">two</num> parties than by the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>The ablest <rs>Generals</rs> of the invading army are approved <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs>, and the most brutal of all their military leaders, the beast <rs>Butler</rs>, was a supporter of <persName n="Breckenridge,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00194" reg="mostcommon:Breckenridge,nomatch:0"><surname>Breckenridge</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/> We repeat, the mode of carrying on the war, and not the war itself is the bone of contention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>The motives of the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> are envy, hatred, revenge, malice, and all the wheat impulses of human nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>In the made desire to gratify their vindictiveness and spite, they are perfectly blind to consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>If they could only get the <rs>South</rs> under their feet and crush it out of existence, they would be willing to see &#x0022;the <rs>Union</rs>&#x0022; itself go to destruction in <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure> afterwards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>Hence they are ready to light the torch of insurrection, careless whether it consumes the staples which have always been the basis of their own wealth, so long as it sweeps from the face of the earth every vestige of the hated <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>The motives of the <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs>, on the other hand, are political, commercial, and mercenary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>They desire to avail themselves of the blunders, mismanagement, and despotism of the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> to get once more in power, and obtain the enormous patronage of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>They have also the intelligence to perceive that the overthrow of slavery would involve the commercial ruin of the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>They would be willing to give any guarantee that the <rs>South</rs> might desire for the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>, provided she would return to the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>But it is always &#x0022;the <rs>Union</rs>.&#x0022; When they speak of peace, which we do not doubt that they desire, it is peace by the restoration of the <rs>South</rs> to its former relations to the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/><persName n="Buren,,John,,,Van" id="n-0001.0000.00000.00195" reg="expanded:Buren,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <nameLink>Van</nameLink> <surname>Buren</surname></persName> alone has professed a willingness (after the capture of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>) to call a Convention of all the <name>States</name>, and in the event of the <rs>Southern States</rs> still insisting upon separation, to say to them, in the language of <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00196" reg="mostcommon:Scott,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>, &#x0022;Wayward sisters depart in peace.&#x0022; We have heard no each of that sentiment from the <rs>Northern Democratic</rs> journals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>Their invocation is, &#x0022;Wayward sisters, come back, and you shall have all you want; but come back you must.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/> The pacific professions of sundry private soldiers and officers in the <rs>Federal</rs> army are of no earthly importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>Perhaps they are in reality tired of the war &mdash; as who is not &mdash; but their practice does not accord with their professions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>A gentleman from <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> states that the very <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> officers and soldiers who were loudest before the late battle in declaring to Confederate citizens that our people had nothing to fear from Federal violence, and that they were anxious for peace, were foremost in the destruction of private property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>No confidence can be placed in anything that these men say. The Father of Lies seems to have full possession of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>Their actions alone are the reliable exponents of their purposes, and those all indicate only the most hostile and destructive intent, so that it may be said of the most smooth spoken and polite of them, in the language of Scripture, &#x0022;their words are sober than butter but there is war in their hearts.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>
