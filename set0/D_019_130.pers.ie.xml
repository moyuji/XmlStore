<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Besides their deeds of plunder, they resort to other and more vile and inhuman crimes in the outrages of our women and children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>A young lady, daughter of a respectable farmer living in the vicinity of <orgName n="Newport News" type="newspaper">Newport News</orgName>, was taken by these reckless villains and imprisoned in <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName> where, judging from what has already been done, a most foul and inhuman outrage will be perpetrated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Southern oppose troops were boiling at the latter point, while others more reasonably surmised that guns were being taken from the <rs>Fort</rs> &mdash; a belief to which I incline after noticing their recent movements on our coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>That their idea is to fortify <orgName n="Newport News" type="newspaper">Newport News</orgName> and make it as impregnable as possible, is found in the fact that already quite an embankment has been thrown up, and negroes, doubtless from the farms near by, assist in the fortification. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing which struck our attention was an editorial in the <name>Traited</name> d' Union, of the last date, which contains some significant references to political affairs in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>If the spirit therein displayed should prevail in the <rs>Government</rs>, it will be very unexpected to the <rs>Lincoln Administration</rs>, who have been counting on <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> sympathy.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> &#x0022;If <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> should receive him as representing at once the <name>States</name> of the <rs>North</rs> and of the <rs>South</rs>, it would thereby discredit the legitimate authority of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> and of the <rs>Government</rs> at <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName>; and this is not more possible for them. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>That question may be handled later.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The only question for the present is that of his reception, and frankly the case seems to us a very embarrassing <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Perhaps it will be submitted to Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>This argument may now be returned against the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs>; for the authority against <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abe,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> is certainly very far from reaching over the whole of the country which once formed the <orgName n="United States Confederation" type="federation">confederation of the United States</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> <q>&#x0022;This reasoning is strengthened by other considerations less potent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>That promise was ignored by the incoming Ministry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>The Southern Commissioners insisted on it that, apart from the compact of <persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00033" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName>'s Cabinet, a pledge had been given to the <rs>South</rs> that no attempt would be made to reinforce the forts without notice to the <rs>Government</rs> at <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName>, and, so far as can be ascertained, the authorities at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> did cause to be conveyed to the <rs>Southern Confederation</rs> the expression of their intention to victual <placeName key="tgn,2335552" n="1.000 10" reg="Fort Sumpter, Baker, Oregon">Sumpter</placeName>; but whether they do so in respect to their pledge, if it existed, or in consequence of the decision at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> to prevent the issuing of further supplies to the garrison, is uncertain.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/> &#x0022;The tube or barrel is formed of several cylinders or rings of cast or wrought iron, its longitudinal cylindrical parts affording the means of uniting the rings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>The interior of the tube is rifled by means of a number of projecting spiral rods, shaped in triangular prisms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>The tube can be lengthened at pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>The breech of the gun is a mortar, to which the tube is attached, and from which it may be detached, either for the purpose of loading it at the breech or of making use of it as a mortar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>It is alleged that this cannon cannot become heated, that the process of cleansing after each discharge is unnecessary, except as regards the breech, and that it may be fired <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> times during the space now required to fire any other gun once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>Another consequence said to follow from the non-heating of the barrel of the gun is, that there is no danger of bursting, either from defect in the metal or from overcharge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>The gun may otherwise be lengthened or shortened at pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>The inventor states that a gun throwing a shot of <num value="120">120</num>-lb.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>weight may be taken to pieces and conveyed on the back of a horse or mule over roads impassable for carriages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>He shows that there is a considerable saving in the construction of this gun in consequence of the tube being of open work, and of iron in place of bronze.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>It may be as light as is consistent with the resistance which its weight must necessary oppose to the recoil produced by its discharge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>The inventor expects that this gun will supercede mortars, and that every cannon mounted on a ship's deck may be used both as a cannon and a mortar, and that a ship which carries <num value="40">forty</num> guns may be said to carry <num value="40">forty</num> guns and <num value="40">forty</num> mortars. </p> </q><bibl n="London Times"></bibl></cit> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>Here, then, we have a large fund for indemnity, and the suggestion to which we invite attention, is the reimbursement of our citizens from this property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>Leaving the plan to be elaborated by others more competent, we can safely assert that a procedure of this kind would not only amply protect our citizens, but have a beneficial effect upon our blockading squadrons, as they will soon be taught that they are <hi rend="italics">capturing from their own people.</hi> Nor would it work oppressively to individuals, as they would have a valid claim against their own Government for the value of the property sold, in consequence of their unjust act towards others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>Prompt action is essential, as our indemnity is daily decreasing by the transfer of bonds held North to Southern purchasers.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/> <q>&#x0022;Did I put on a sober face?&#x0022;</q> asked the husband, with an attempt to smile, that was anything but a success. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/> <q>&#x0022;Yes, sober as a man on trial for his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/>Why it's as long as the moral law. There, dear, clear it up, and look at least as if you had <num value="1">one</num> friend in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/>What money lovers you men are?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/> <q>&#x0022;How much will it cost?&#x0022;</q> inquired <persName n="Whitman,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00332" reg="mostcommon:Whitman,Charles,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Whitman</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/>There was another effort to look cheerful and acquiescent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/> <q>&#x0022;A bout <measure n="40dollars" type="currency">forty dollars</measure>.&#x0022;</q> </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/> <q>&#x0022;I declare, <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName></persName>,&#x0022;</q> said his wife, a little impatiently, <q>&#x0022;you look at me as if I were an object of affection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>I don't think this is kind of you. I've only had <num value="3">three</num> silk dresses since we were married, while Amy Blight has had <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="7">seven</num> during the same period, and every <num value="1">one</num> of her's cost more than mine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>I know you think me extravagant, but I wish you had a wife like women I could name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>I rather think you would find out the difference before long.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/> &#x0022;There, there, don't talk to me after this fashion ! I'll bring you the money at dinner time; that is, if-- </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/> <q>&#x0022;No its nor buts, if you please.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>The sentence is complete without them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>Thank you, dear ! I'll go this afternoon and buy my silk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/>So don't fail to bring the money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>I was in at Silksin's yesterday, and saw <num value="1">one</num> of the sweetest patterns I ever laid my eyes on. Just suits my style and complexion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>I shall be in consolable if it's gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>You won't disappoint me?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/> And <persName n="Whitman,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00335" reg="mostcommon:Whitman,Charles,,,:1"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Whitman</surname></persName> laid her soft, white hand on the arm of her husband, and smiled with sweet persuasion in her face. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/> <q>&#x0022;Oh, no. You shall have the money,&#x0022;</q> said <persName n="Whitman,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00336" reg="mostcommon:Whitman,Charles,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Whitman</surname></persName>, turning off from his wife, as she thought, a little abruptly, and hurrying from her presence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/>In his precipitation he had forgotten his usual parting kiss. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/> <q>&#x0022;That's the way it is always !&#x0022;</q> said <persName n="Whitman,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00337" reg="mostcommon:Whitman,Charles,,,:1"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Whitman</surname></persName>, as the sound of the closing street door came jarring on her ears; <q>&#x0022;Just say money to <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName></persName>, and at once there is a cloud in the sky.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/> She sat down, pouting and half angry. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/> <q>&#x0022;<measure n="40dollars" type="currency">Forty dollars</measure> for a new dress&#x0022;</q> mentally ejaculated the husband of vain, pretty, thoughtless <persName n="Whitman,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00338" reg="mostcommon:Whitman,Charles,,,:1"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Whitman</surname></persName>, as he shut the door after him. <q>&#x0022;I promised to settle <persName n="Thompson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00339" reg="nearbymention:Thompson,Richmond,,,"><surname>Thompson</surname></persName>'s coal bill to-day, <measure n="33dollars" type="currency">thirty-three dollars</measure>, but don't know where the money is to come from.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>The coal is burnt up, and more must be ordered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>O, dear ! I'm discouraged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>Every year I fall behind-hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/>This winter I did hope to get a little in advance; but if <measure n="40dollars" type="currency">forty dollar</measure> silk dresses are to be the order of the day, there's an end to that devoutly-to-be-wished-for circumstance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>Debt, debt ! How I have always shrunk from it; but steadily, now, it is closing its Barbarian arms around me, and my constricting chest labors in respiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>Oh, if I could but disentangle myself now, while I have the strength of my early manhood, and the bonds that hold me are weak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>If <persName n="Ada,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00340" reg="mostcommon:Ada,nomatch:0"><surname>Ada</surname></persName> could see as I see &mdash; if I could only make her understand rightly my position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>Alas that is hopeless, I fear.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/> And <persName n="Whitman,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00341" reg="mostcommon:Whitman,Charles,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Whitman</surname></persName> hurried his steps because his heart beat quicker, and his thought was unduly excited. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/> Not a long time after <persName n="Whitman,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00342" reg="mostcommon:Whitman,Charles,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Whitman</surname></persName> left home, the city postmaster delivered a letter to his address.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/>His wife examined the writing on the envelope, which was in a bold masculine hand, and said to herself, as she did so-- </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/> <q>&#x0022;I wonder who this can be from?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/> Something more than curiosity moved her. There intruded on her mind a vague feeling of disquietude, as if the missive bore unpleasant news for her husband.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>The stamp showed it to be a city letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>A few times of late such letters had come to his address, and she had noticed that he read them hurriedly, thrust them without remark into his pocket, and became silent and sober-faced. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/> <persName n="Whitman,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00343" reg="mostcommon:Whitman,Charles,,,:1"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Whitman</surname></persName> turned the letter over and over again in her hand in a thoughtful way, and as she did so, the image of her husband, sober-faced and silent, as he had become for most of the time of late, presented itself with unusual vividness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/>Sympathy stole into her heart. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/> <q>&#x0022;Poor <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName></persName> !&#x0022;</q> she said, as the feeling increased, <q>&#x0022;I am afraid something is going wrong with him.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/> Placing the letter on the mantelpiece where he could see it when he came in, <persName n="Whitman,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00344" reg="mostcommon:Whitman,Charles,,,:1"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Whitman</surname></persName> entered upon some household duties, but a strange impression, of a weight, lay upon her heart &mdash; a sense of impending evil &mdash; a vague, troubled, disturbance of her usual inward self-satisfaction. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/> If the thought of <persName n="Whitman,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00345" reg="mostcommon:Whitman,Charles,,,:1"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Whitman</surname></persName> recurred, as was natural, to the elegant silk dress of which she was to become the owner on that day, she did not feel the proud satisfaction her vain heart experienced a little while before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>Something of its beauty had faded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/> <q>&#x0022;If I only knew what that letter contained,&#x0022;</q> she said, half an hour after it had come in, her mind still feeling the pressure which had come down upon it so strangely, as it seemed to her. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/> She went to the mantel-piece, took up the letter, and examined the superscription.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>It gave her no light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/>Steadily it kept growing upon her that its contents were of a nature to trouble her husband. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/> <q>&#x0022;He's been a little mysterious of late,&#x0022;</q> she said to herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/>This idea affected her very unpleasantly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/><q>&#x0022;He grows more silent and reserved,&#x0022;</q> she added, as thought, under a kind of feverish excitement, became active in a new direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/><q> &#x0022;More indrawn, as it were, and less interested in what goes on around him.--His coldness chills me at times and his irritation hurts me.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/> She drew a long deep sigh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>Then with an almost startling vividness came before her mind in contrast her tender, loving, cheerful husband of <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> before, and her quiet, silent, sober-faced husband of to-day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/> <q>&#x0022;Something has gone wrong with him!&#x0022;</q> she said aloud, as feeling grew stronger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/><q>&#x0022;What can it be?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/> The letter was in her hand. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/> <q>&#x0022;This may give me light.&#x0022;</q> And with careful fingers she opened the envelope, not breaking the paper, so that she could seal it again if she desired so to do. There was a bill for <measure n="60dollars" type="currency">sixty dollars</measure>, and a communication from the person sending the bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/>He was a jeweler. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/> <q>&#x0022;If this is not settled at once,&#x0022;</q> he wrote,&#x0022; <q>&#x0022;I shall put the account in suit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>It has been standing for over a year; and I am tired of getting excuses instead of money.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/> The bill was for a lady's watch which <persName n="Whitman,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00346" reg="mostcommon:Whitman,Charles,,,:1"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Whitman</surname></persName> had almost compelled her husband to purchase. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/> <q>&#x0022;Not paid for ! Is it possible?&#x0022;</q> exclaimed the little woman in blank astonishment, while the blood mounted to her forehead. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/> Then she sat down to <unclear>k</unclear> Light began to come into her mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>As she sat thus thinking, a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> letter for her husband came in from the penny-post man. She opened it without hesitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>Another bill, and another duaning letter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/> <q>&#x0022;Not paid ! Is it possible?&#x0022;</q> She repeated the ejaculation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/>It was a bill of <measure n="25dollars" type="currency">twenty-five dollars</measure> for gaiters and slippers, which had been standing for <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/> <q>&#x0022;This will never do !&#x0022;</q> said the awakening wife--<q>&#x0022;never, no, never !&#x0022;</q> And she thrust the <num value="2">two</num> letters into her pocket in a resolute way. From that hour until the return of her husband at dinner time, <persName n="Whitman,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00347" reg="mostcommon:Whitman,Charles,,,:1"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Whitman</surname></persName> did an unusual amount of thinking for her little brain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>She saw, the moment he entered, that the morning cloud had not passed from his brown. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/> <q>&#x0022;Here is the money for that new dress,&#x0022;</q> he said, taking a small roll of bills from his vest pocket, and handing them to <persName n="Ada,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00348" reg="mostcommon:Ada,nomatch:0"><surname>Ada</surname></persName>, as he came in. He did not kiss her, nor smile in the old bright way. But his voice was calm, if not cheerful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>A kiss and a smile just then would have been more precious to the young wife than a <num value="100">hundred</num> silk dresses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>She took the money, saying: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/> &#x0022;Thank you, dear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>It is kind of you to regard my wishes.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/> Something in <persName n="Ada,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00349" reg="mostcommon:Ada,nomatch:0"><surname>Ada</surname></persName>'s voice and manner caused <persName n="Whitman,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00350" reg="mostcommon:Whitman,Charles,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Whitman</surname></persName> to lift his eyes, with a look of inquiry to her face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>But she turned away, so that he could not read its expression. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/> He was graver and more silent than usual, and eat with scarcely an appearance of appetite. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/> <q>&#x0022;Come home early, dear,&#x0022;</q> said <persName n="Whitman,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00351" reg="mostcommon:Whitman,Charles,,,:1"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Whitman</surname></persName>, as she walked to the door with her husband after dinner. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/> <q>&#x0022;Are you anxious to have me admire your new silk dress?&#x0022;</q> he replied, with a faint effort to smile. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/> <q>&#x0022;Yes; it will be something splendid,&#x0022;</q> she answered. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/> He turned off from her quickly, and left the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/>A few moments she stood, with a thoughtful face, her mind indrawn, and her Whole manner completely changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>She went <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> to her room and commenced dressing to go out. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/> <measure n="2hours" type="date">Two hours</measure> later and we find her in a jewelry store on <placeName key="tgn,2110813" n="1.000 2" reg="broadway, rockingham, virginia">Broadway</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/> <q>&#x0022;Can I say a word to you?&#x0022;</q> She addressed the owner of the store, who knew her very well. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/> <q>&#x0022;Certainly,&#x0022;</q> he replied, and they moved to the lower end of <num value="1">one</num> of the long <rs n="show cases" type="product">show cases</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/> <persName n="Whitman,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00352" reg="mostcommon:Whitman,Charles,,,:1"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Whitman</surname></persName> drew from her pocket a lady's watch and chain, and laying them on the show case, said, at the same time holding out the bill she had taken from the envelope addressed to her husband. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/> <q>&#x0022;I cannot afford to wear this watch; my husband's circumstances are too limited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/>I tell you so frankly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>It should never have been purchased, but a too indulgent husband yielded to the importunities of a foolish young wife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/>I say this to take the blame from him. Now, sir, meet the case, if you can do so in fairness to yourself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/>Take back the watch, and say how much I shall pay you besides.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/> The jeweler dropped his eyes to think.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>The case took him a little by surprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>He stood for nearly a minute; then, taking the bill and watch, he said: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/> <q>&#x0022;Wait a moment,&#x0022;</q> and went to a desk near by. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/> <q>&#x0022;Will that do?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/> He had come forward again, and now presented her with the receipted bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/>His face wore a pleased expression. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/> <q>&#x0022;How much shall I pay you?&#x0022;</q> asked <persName n="Whitman,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00353" reg="mostcommon:Whitman,Charles,,,:1"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Whitman</surname></persName>, drawing out her pocket-book. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/> <q>&#x0022;Nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>The watch is not defaced.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="868"/> <q>&#x0022;You have done a kind act, sir,&#x0022;</q> said <persName n="Whitman,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00354" reg="mostcommon:Whitman,Charles,,,:1"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Whitman</surname></persName>, with feeling trembling along her voice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="869"/><q>&#x0022;I hope you will not think unfavorably of my husband.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="870"/>It's no fault of his that the debt has not been paid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="871"/>Good morning, sir.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="872"/> <persName n="Whitman,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00355" reg="mostcommon:Whitman,Charles,,,:1"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Whitman</surname></persName> drew her veil over her face, and went with light steps and a light heart, from the store.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/>The pleasure she had experienced on receiving her watch was not to be compared with that now felt in parting with it, From the jeweler's she went to the boot makers and paid the bill of <measure n="25dollars" type="currency">twenty-five dollars</measure>; from thence to her milliner's, and settled up for her last bonnet. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/> <q>&#x0022;I know you're dying to see my new dress,&#x0022;</q> said <persName n="Whitman,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00356" reg="mostcommon:Whitman,Charles,,,:1"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Whitman</surname></persName>, gaily, as she drew her arm within that of her husband, on his appearance that evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/><q>&#x0022;Come over to our bed-room, and let me show it. Come along Don't hang back, <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName></persName>, as if you were afraid. &#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/> <persName n="Whitman,,Charles,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00357" reg="default:Whitman,Charles,,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Whitman</surname></persName> went with his wife passively, looking more like a man on his way to receive sentence than in expectation of a pleasant sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/>His thoughts were bitter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="878"/> <q>&#x0022;Shall my <persName n="Ada,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00358" reg="mostcommon:Ada,nomatch:0"><surname>Ada</surname></persName> become lost to me,&#x0022;</q>--he said in his heart--<q> &#x0022;lost to me in a world of folly, fashion, and extravagance?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/> <q>&#x0022;Sit down, <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName></persName>.&#x0022;</q> She led him to a large, cushioned chair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/>Her manner had undergone a change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>The brightness of her countenance had departed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>She took something, in a hurried way from the drawer, and catching up a footstool, placed it on the floor near him, and looked tenderly and lovingly in his face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>Then she handed the jeweler's bill. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/> <q>&#x0022;It is receipted, you see.&#x0022;</q> Her voice fluttered a little. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/> <q>&#x0022;<persName n="Ada,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00359" reg="mostcommon:Ada,nomatch:0"><surname>Ada</surname></persName> ! how is this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/>What does it mean?&#x0022;</q>--He flushed and grew eager. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/> <q>&#x0022;I returned the watch, and Mr. R. receipted the bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>I would have paid for damages, but he said it was uninjured, and asked nothing.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="889"/> <q>&#x0022;Oh, <persName n="Ada,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00360" reg="mostcommon:Ada,nomatch:0"><surname>Ada</surname></persName> !&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="890"/> <q>&#x0022;And this is receipted also &mdash; and this,&#x0022;</q> handing other bills she had paid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="891"/><q>&#x0022;And now, dear,&#x0022;</q> she added, quickly, <q>&#x0022;how do you like my dress?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="892"/>Isn't it beautiful?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="893"/> We leave the explanation and scene that followed to the reader's imagination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="894"/>If any fair lady, however, who, like <persName n="Ada,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00361" reg="mostcommon:Ada,nomatch:0"><surname>Ada</surname></persName>, has been drawing too heavily upon her husband's slender income for silks and jewels, is at a loss to realize the scene, let her try <persName n="Ada,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00362" reg="mostcommon:Ada,nomatch:0"><surname>Ada</surname></persName>'s experiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="895"/>Our word for it she will find a new and glad experience in life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="896"/>Costly silks and jewels may be very pleasant things, but they are too dearly bought when they come at the cost of a husband's embarrassment, mental disquietude, or alienation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="897"/>Too often the gay young wife wears them as the sign of these unhappy conditions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="898"/>Tranquil hearts and sunny homes are precious things &mdash; too precious to be burdened and clouded by weak vanity and love of show.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="899"/>Keep this in mind, <unclear>O ye</unclear> fair ones, who have husbands in moderate circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="900"/>Do not let your pride and pleasure oppress them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="901"/>Rich clothing, costly laces and gems, are poor substitutes for smiling faces and hearts unshadowed by care.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="902"/>Take the lesson and live by it, rather than offer another illustration in your own experience of the folly we have been trying to expose and rebuke. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
