<head>The salt question.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> This question, we observe, is again under hammer in the <name>Legislature</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>A joint committee of both Houses, to whom was referred sundry allegations of the <rs>State Superintendent</rs> and suggestions of the <orgName n="Public Works Board" type="board">Board of Public Works</orgName>, and who were instructed to ascertain the causes of the obstructions in furnishing a supply of salt to the people, have, after a protracted investigation, submitted a report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>In this report the committee state: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The whole evidence conclusively shows that the lessors have repeatedly failed to deliver brine to the <rs>State</rs> furnaces, according to the terms of their contract of lease, whereby said furnaces could not be worked up to their full boiling capacity, and were in fact often &#x0022;blown out&#x0022; entirely for the want of a supply of salt water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The committee are clearly of opinion that there is a legal liability resting on <orgName><persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,nomatch:0"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName>, <persName n="Buchanan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,nomatch:0"><surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> &#x0026; Co.</orgName> to make good to the <rs>State</rs> the loss resulting from this failure on their part to comply with their contract.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The tenor of the evidence estimates the loss from this source at from <num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num> to <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> bushels of salt. </p> </q><bibl n="Committee"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The Superintendent, in his communication to the <name>Board</name> of Supervisors, of date <date value="1863-09-04">September 4, 1863,</date> complains that the lessors delivered a portion of the leased furnaces in very bad order, the flues of some of the furnaces requiring extensive repairs, almost, or quite equivalent to rebuilding them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>These allegations are fully sustained by the evidence, and the loss accruing therefrom at <num value="1">one</num> of the furnaces, estimated by <num value="1">one</num> of the witnesses at &#x0022;from <num value="400">four hundred</num> to <num value="500">five hundred</num> bushels of salt per day for <num value="10">ten</num> or <measure n="12days" type="date">twelve days</measure>,&#x0022; when the <rs>State</rs> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> took possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Your committee would be derelict of their duty, if they failed, in this final report, to bear their emphatic and unqualified testimony to the zeal, energy, intelligence, and skill in the whole complicated business, and no less the integrity and fidelity to his trust, which has marked, in a conspicuous manner, the administration of <persName n="Clarkson,,John,N.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="default:Clarkson,John,N.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>N.</foreName> <surname>Clarkson</surname></persName>, the <rs>State</rs> <rs type="role" reg="Superintendent">Superintendent</rs> of Salt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> But when the <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName> calls to mind the distressful and almost alarming condition of our people throughout the year <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct> and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> half of <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>; the absolute suffering of man and beast for want of salt; the repeated failures to obtain it from the owners of the <rs>Salt Works</rs>, under county contracts and contracts by the <rs>Governor</rs> &mdash; and now, on the other hand, find that the people and the markets are so fully supplied with a sound; merchantable article, that despite a deprecated currency and fabulous prices for all other articles of human consumption, salt alone is quoted in the price lists as &#x0022;dull and flat&#x0022; and &#x0022;cheap,&#x0022; they will find in this the highest vindication of their legislative policy, and proof that they have been fortunate in their selection of agents to carry out that policy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The Committee it seems made sundry efforts to make satisfactory arrangements with the proprietors of the salt works for continuing the <rs>State</rs> operations in making salt after the expiration of the present lease, on the <date value="06-08">8th of June</date> next, but they say the proprietors so fettered their proposals with terms and stipulations as virtually, in the judgment of the committee, to render the whole scheme nugatory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>A portion of your committee favored the condemnation of this entire salt property to the public use, State and Confederate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>But the committee prefer to confine themselves to so much only as shall be ample to insure a full supply of this indispensable necessary of life to our own people and to the armies of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and should any surplus be left over, then to furnish that surplus to our sister <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>This they proposed to do by commencing at a point in the cellar, near a chimney.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>The party were by no means undaunted, and with penknives and <rs n="pocket knives" type="product">pocket-knives</rs> they commenced operations upon the stone and mortar.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>The <rs>Dannewerk</rs> is the great <placeName key="tgn,1000066" n="1.000 10" reg="Danmark,Europe">Danish</placeName> bulwark of the <name>Duchy</name> of Schleswig.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>It is of very ancient origin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>It is situated at the extreme southern part of the <name>Duchy</name> of Schleswig, and is now an enormous earthwork that stretches almost across the entire country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>The length of the peninsula of Schleswig-<persName n="Holstein,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00066" reg="nearbymention:Holstein,Schleswig,,,"><surname>Holstein</surname></persName> to the end of Jutland is said to be near <measure n="300miles" type="distance">three hundred miles</measure>; so that it extends almost as far as the base line of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> from the <name>North Foreland</name> to <persName n="Land,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00067" reg="mostcommon:Land,nomatch:0"><surname>Land</surname></persName>'s End. The breadth of the peninsula, however, is but <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of its length, and the <name>Dannewerk</name> is a fortification that reaches very nearly across the land from the <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> Ocean to the <name>Battle</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/> This &#x0022;border wall&#x0022; is said to have been erected in the <num value="9" type="ordinal">ninth</num> century, and, according to the accounts given of it in &#x0022;Olat Trygbeson's Saga,&#x0022; it was built of wood, stone, and earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>In the year <dateStruct value="937"><year reg="937">937</year></dateStruct> the wall, we are told, was strengthened by <persName><roleName n="Queen">Queen</roleName> <foreName>Thyra</foreName></persName>, whom the people, in their thankfulness for the national defence, christened Danabod, which, literally translated, means the pride of the <rs n="Dane" type="group">Danes</rs>; and, as a proof of the extreme antiquity of the structure, there has been seen at Flensburg a splendid collection of flint arrow heads and axes collected from the barrows or earth mounds in the immediate neighborhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>There were spear points wrought out of splinters of flint no thicker than paper knives, and worked sharper than the best steel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>Here, too, were shown the knuckle bone like stones which had been used to separate the fine layers of <sic>alliceous</sic> earth from the solid mass, and which were found embedded in these same barrows with the very flint chip beside them that the people, <num value="1000">thousands</num> of years before, had broken from the integral block. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/> Here, moreover, were the slabs of stone that the old Celts had used to grind their spear heads on to the sharpest possible points, grooved with the toils of the workmen, and seeming as if they were destined to tell the present age how this wonderfully fine workmanship of the hardest possible material was executed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>Indeed, in this collection of works long precedent to history, were arrow heads made out of flint hardly thicker than mother of pearl, and wrought as sharp as a needle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>The fortress consists at the present day (without going into all the niceties of historical detail) of <num value="3">three</num> enormous earthworks stretching across the entire breadth of the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>They are so arranged as to form the neck, or tunnel, with a long outwork to protect the narrow channel through which the troops are ultimately intended to be driven.--Towards the <rs>Baltic</rs>, or <placeName reg="Yam Hamela,Asia" key="tgn,7018638">East Sea</placeName>, there runs the &#x0022;Oster-Wolden,&#x0022; (or east rampart.) This lies towards the &#x0022;Eckenforde,&#x0022; and is sometimes called the &#x0022;Camel-Dannewerk.&#x0022; It is about <num value="2">two</num> <name>English</name> miles long, the earthworks being from <num value="4">four</num> to <measure n="5feet" type="distance">five feet</measure> high and <measure n="16yards" type="distance">sixteen yards</measure> broad, and beset with a ditch, the depth of which varies from <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> to <measure n="10feet" type="distance">ten feet</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/> Beyond this is the great bay formed by the river <rs>Schley</rs>, which is so wide that no troops could possibly attempt to pass it. Stretching immediately in front of this is the &#x0022;Kurgraben, &#x0022; which is upwards of a mile in length, beginning at the end of the <rs>Selker Luke</rs>; it is from <measure n="10feet" type="distance">ten feet</measure> to <measure n="12feet" type="distance">twelve feet</measure> broad, and from <measure n="4feet" type="distance">four feet</measure> to <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> high.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>Behind this lies the great &#x0022;Dannewerk&#x0022; itself, which consists of an earthwork not less than <measure n="14miles" type="distance">fourteen miles</measure> long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>In some parts it is from <measure n="30feet" type="distance">thirty feet</measure> to <measure n="36feet" type="distance">thirty-six feet</measure> high, and the ramparts are from <measure n="16feet" type="distance">sixteen feet</measure> to <measure n="20feet" type="distance">twenty feet</measure> broad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>The whole of these earthworks are immediately in connection from <num value="1">one</num> side of the peninsula to the other, with the river <rs>Schley</rs> on the eastern side, and with the river <rs>Treene</rs>, which falls into the <rs>Northern Ocean</rs>; so that the <rs>Danish</rs> forces have it within their power to flood not less than <num value="64">sixty-four</num> square miles of land in front of the great bulwark of Schleswig at a moment's notice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/> &#x0022;But,&#x0022; say the <rs>Saxon</rs> soldiers to the writer, &#x0022;what are the uses of the sluice gates in this time of frost?&#x0022; Talking with <placeName key="tgn,1000066" n="1.000 10" reg="Danmark,Europe">Danish</placeName> engineers, they say they had flooded the country with the thinnest pellicle of ice, and let the water out immediately afterwards, so that any troops attempting to cross the country would be mowed down by the artillery like corn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>Indeed, there is not the least doubt that <num value="40000">forty thousand</num> men could hold the <name>Dannewerk</name> against <num value="100000">one hundred thousand</num> opposing troops, and it would require as strong an army as united <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> could possibly muster to wrest Schleswig from <placeName reg="Danmark, Europe, " key="tgn,1000066">Denmark</placeName>. </p> </div4> </div3>

<head>Currency and prices.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/> The fact is patent to all persons who have been compelled to purchase anything that prices have been greatly enhanced since the passage of the act of Congress to reduce the amount of the currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>Some persons who know better may have used the bill as a pretense for raising their prices, but there is in the community generally a lamentable ignorance on the subject of currency, and their fears of what is to be the effect of the bill are leading them to do great injustice to themselves or to others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>We believe it is demonstrable that the bill must operate in favor of the holders of treasury notes, notwithstanding the tax of <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> upon their amount, and that in fact they will reap the whole benefit of the tax upon property which shall be applied to the reduction of the amount of the treasury notes in circulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>Our opinion is based upon a few elementary and recognised principles, of the correctness of which we believe there is little or no difference of opinion among writers upon the currency, and to these principles we ask the attention of our readers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/> The wealth of a country consists of its property and labor, including its skill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>Currency is merely an instrument to facilitate the exchange of property and the employment of labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>The material of which currency is composed may be a part of the wealth of a country, but the currency as such is no part of that wealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>The currency value of the material is distinct from the intrinsic or real value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>The currency value may be immense, whilst the intrinsic value of the material may be very small.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>We can readily comprehend this fact when paper is the currency; but it is also true of <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>If the whole world should at once put an end to the currency of <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs>, their value would be fixed, like that of iron and lead, by the uses to which they could be applied. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/> Again: It is the experience of the world that the prices of property and labor are regulated by the amount of the currency in the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>This is the general law, though there may be partial and temporary exceptions to it, as by the excess or failure of <num value="1">one</num> of the staple crops of the country, or a temporary obstruction to the transportation of supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>The amount of currency which is necessary in any country to facilitate the exchanges of property and the employment of labor will depend upon the amount of property, the activity of commerce and labor, and the extent of credits employed in carrying on business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>All these vary from time to time, and therefore the amount of currency actually employed varies also, as prices are affected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>If the amount of currency is unchanged, whilst property is increased and commerce and labor are active, prices go down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>If the amount of currency is increased, whilst property, commerce, and labor is diminished, prices go up. And if the currency increases in greater progression than property and labor, prices continue to rise; and by the inflation of prices and the facility of obtaining money, with the apprehension that the currency will fail, a spirit of speculation is aroused which carries prices much higher than is required to meet the increase of the currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>This is our condition now. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/> It is immaterial what the currency is &mdash; whether paper or gold &mdash; the result is substantially the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>It requires only so much currency to carry on the business of a country, and when that is increased, whatever it may be, the necessity of finding employment for it compels the rise of prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>It is true that where commerce is open there never can be this great accumulation of gold in <num value="1">one</num> country, because the demand for it in other countries will carry it off. But if a country were wholly separated from the rest of the world, and gold accumulated in it, the effect on prices would be the same as it is in the case of paper money. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/> And whilst it is true that the accumulation of gold in a country would affect prices just as the accumulation of a paper currency would and does affect them, it is equally true that though the currency is wholly of paper, yet if it is not greater in amount than is required for carrying on the business of the country, prices will be as moderate and stable as if it was gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>From <dateStruct value="1796--"><year reg="1796">1796</year></dateStruct> down to <dateStruct value="1822--"><year reg="1822">1822</year></dateStruct> specie payments were suspended in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>; but until about <dateStruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></dateStruct>, we believe, the currency was not increased beyond the demands of the business of the country, and there was no depreciation of the currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>At that time the amount of the currency was increased, and it immediately began to depreciate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/> It is, then, a fact that the prices of property and labor are regulated by the currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>If there is more currency than the business of the country requires, prices will go up, and where the currency becomes very much inflated, speculation will carry up prices even higher than the due proportion between the amount of currency and the property and labor of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>It is estimated that the amount of currency in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> at the commencement of the war, was from <num value="80">eighty</num> to <num value="100000000">one hundred millions</num>.--The better authority is, we think, in favor of the last amount.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>But at the present time, deducting that part of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> occupied by the enemy, where our currency does not now circulate, probably the currency at the commencement of the war amounted to from <num value="70000000">seventy</num> to <num value="80000000">eighty millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>At this day we have within this territory a currency of <num value="800000000">eight hundred millions</num> of treasury notes; or <num value="10">ten</num> times as much as we had at the commencement of the war.--No doubt the change in the mode of doing business from extensive credits to cash, involves the necessity of a larger amount of currency than we then had, and has had some effect in keeping prices below what they would otherwise have been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>But we have in the present prices of all property and labor the evidence that the currency is greatly beyond what the necessities of the country require. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/> If the foregoing facts and principles are true, then, it follows inevitably that if the <num value="800000000">eight hundred millions</num> of treasury notes are reduced to an amount not more than enough to perform the legitimate office of currency, which is to facilitate the exchanges of the property and the employment of the labor of the country, this reduced amount will purchase the same amount of property, and employ the same amount of labor, as the whole <num value="800000000">eight hundred millions</num> now does. --We say the same amount &mdash; though, in fact, it would do more, because it would put an end to the wild spirit of speculation and extortion which exists in the country, and enhance prices above what the mere increase of the currency would have done. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/> The object of the act of Congress is to reduce the currency to the proper amount.--As to what that amount is, there may be some doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>For reasons which we cannot state here, we suppose that it is about <num value="2">two</num> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> <num value="150000000">hundred and fifty millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>There is some doubt too as to the extent of the reduction which will be effected by the act. But it we have not over estimated the amount of currency which will be necessary to carry on the business of the country, there is little doubt that the effect of the act will be to reduce it sufficiently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>Even if there shall have been issued <num value="840000000">eight hundred and forty millions</num> of Treasury notes by <date value="04-01">the first of April,</date> the tax on property will reduce this amount by <num value="250000000">two hundred and fifty millions</num>, leaving <num value="590000000">five hundred and ninety millions</num>; and <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> deducted from this amount leaves but <num value="394000000">three hundred and ninety-four millions</num>, or about <num value="150000000">one hundred and fifty millions</num> above what we suppose to be necessary, to be retired by the investment of the <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">one hundred dollar</measure> notes in <num value="0.04">four per cent</num> bonds, which shall not be paid in for taxes, and in the <num value="0.06">six per cent</num>, bonds authorized by the act, and which are exempted for all time from taxation.--That this amount of Treasury notes will be so invested we do not doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>And the effect of the whole operation will be to enable the holders of Treasury notes which, after paying the tax, will be <num value="66">sixty six</num> and <num value="2">two</num> <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>'s cents in the dollar, to buy property at a price regulated by a currency equal to less than <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of its present amount.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>That is, whilst the holders of Treasury notes have lost by the tax but <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of their amount, and therefore hold <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num>, they will buy property and employ labor at less than <num value="1">one</num> <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of its present prices; and the holders of property after paying the taxes assessed upon it, will sell it at <num value="1">one</num> <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of its present prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>This, we believe, must be the true operation of the act, though at the present moment the opinion seems to be general that anything is more valuable than money. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
