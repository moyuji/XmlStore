<div3 type="article" n="1"> 
<head>Ships and batteries.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> We gave some months ago a minute history of the conflicts between ships and batteries in the great wars of modern times, both in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> and in our own country, from which it appeared that, in the great majority of cases, vessels of war were unable to compete with strong land fortifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>In all the wars of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 9" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> with the continental nations, and in the war of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Revolution and <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>, there was scarcely <num value="1">one</num> exception to this general rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>That such does not seem to be the experience of the present war, is attributed by some to the introduction of steam, and the greater perfection in the mechanical agencies both of the ship and armament, and the more powerful and destructive character of the materials of war. This is an important subject in a country so assailable by sea as our own, which has no navy, and can only rely upon its shore defences to meet the numerous fleets of an enemy who has the whole navy and the whole mercantile marine, now armed, of the all <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> at his command. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> We confess that we have seen nothing <unclear></unclear> of the experiences of this war to change our conviction of the superiority of land fortifications, when properly constructed and efficiently armed, to ships-of-war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The introduction of steam and other naval improvements has not reversed the relative strength of fortifications and vessels, though it undoubtedly requires the former, in order to maintain their old superiority, to be something more than mere earth works, without bomb-proof coverings, which, at <placeName key="tgn,3000601" n="1.000 10" reg="cape hatteras, dare, north carolina">Hatteras</placeName> and <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName>, were easily reduced by the vigorous shelling of the ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The conflict at <placeName reg="Pensacola, Escambia, Florida" key="tgn,7013972">Pensacola</placeName> was the only fair illustration of the question which the present war has furnished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>There the fortifications were properly constructed, the men were sheltered by those defences which military art has provided against the descent of shells, the guns were of proper range, and handled by skillful and practised gunners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The consequence was, that some of the enemy's most powerful ships-of-war were perfectly riddled by the fire of the fortifications, and abandoned the contest precipitately, having failed to inflict the slightest injury upon the works of the <rs>Confederates</rs>, and only killing <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> men. We believe that the result would be the same in every similar engagement between shore and <orgName n="Floating Battery" type="battery">floating batteries</orgName> if the former are properly built, provided with bomb-proofs, and guns of equal range with the enemy, and manned by experienced gunners, who have been disciplined and practiced to the skillful performance of their duties. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> If the application of steam to ships of war and other naval improvements accounts for the success of the enemy in his <num value="2">two</num> assaults upon inconsiderable earthworks, how is it that the great naval squadrons of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> were unable to assail <placeName reg="Sebastopol, Luzerne, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2650582">Sebastopol</placeName> and other <placeName key="tgn,2634462" n="1.000 2" reg="russian river, kenai peninsula, alaska">Russian</placeName> seacoast fortifications with any success, but came off worsted in every encounter, whilst <persName n="Napier,Admiral,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Napier,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Admiral">Admiral</roleName> <surname>Napier</surname></persName> did not even attempt to cope with <placeName key="tgn,7013405" n="1.000 4" reg="kronshtadt,kotlin,leningradskaya oblast',rossiya,rossiya,asia">Cronstadt</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>There was scarcely a sailing vessel in either of these magnificent fleets, the equal of which in numbers, guns, and all the equipments and appliances of war, had never before floated upon the waves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The single ship which bore the broad pennant of <persName n="Napier,Admiral,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Napier,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Admiral">Admiral</roleName> <surname>Napier</surname></persName>, the largest and most powerful war ship in the world, would be more than a match for <num value="3">three</num> of the best ships in the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Every <num value="1">one</num> recollects the impression produced upon the public mind of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 9" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> by the magnificent naval review which took place before <persName n="Napier,Admiral,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Napier,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Admiral">Admiral</roleName> <surname>Napier</surname></persName> sailed for the <rs>Baltic</rs>, and never did Old England seem more completely mistress of the seas than when that vast squadron of magnificent steamships-of-war, led by the colossal flag-ship of the <rs>Admiral</rs>, set sail for the enemy's waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>It would be ridiculous to compare the <num value="50">fifty</num> ships-of-war which comprise the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> navy, and their fleet of old merchantmen, patched up for fighting purposes, with the grand <orgName n="English squadron" type="squadron">English squadron</orgName> of <persName n="Napier,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Napier,nomatch:0"><surname>Napier</surname></persName> in any <num value="1">one</num> particular that gives efficiency to a ship in these times; in machinery, guns, armament and missiles, crews or gunners; and yet it came back to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 9" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> without having reduced or even engaged a single <placeName key="tgn,2634462" n="1.000 2" reg="russian river, kenai peninsula, alaska">Russian</placeName> fortification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>We must evidently look to some other cause than naval improvements for the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> successes at <placeName key="tgn,7005502" n="1.000 7" reg="haiti">Haiti</placeName><unclear></unclear> <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName>, and that cause is to be <unclear>fo</unclear> the weakness of the fortifications, rather than in the strength of the ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>If <persName n="Hatteras,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Hatteras,nomatch:0"><surname>Hatteras</surname></persName> and <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName> had been provided with proper defences against the shell and-shot of the enemy, the result would have been different, as it will be hereafter, if we do not neglect the common provisions against naval assault which have elsewhere rendered shore batteries invulnerable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> We do not recollect but <num value="1">one</num> single success which the combined fleets of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, both in the <rs type="place">Baltic</rs> and the <rs type="place">Black Seas</rs>, achieved during the <rs>Russian</rs> war. That was the reduction of the fortification of Kinburn by the iron-plated vessels introduced by <persName n="Napoleon,,Louis,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="default:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><foreName>Louis</foreName> <surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>That experiment served to demonstrate the capacity of vessels sheltered with that metal to resist the fire of the forts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>But it is, of course, clear that fortifications sheltered in the same armor would be equally invulnerable by ships of war, and an English periodical has lately argued that this defence can be provided as readily and even more economically for fortifications than ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>We earnestly hope that our Government and engineers will give this subject their prompt and serious attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>We have our choice of <placeName reg="Pensacola, Escambia, Florida" key="tgn,7013972">Pensacola</placeName> and <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName> in future conflicts between fortifications and ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>It is hardly worth while to construct coast and river defences merely as slaughter pens for our brave soldiers, and only to invite the enemy to make an attack in which he has every advantage of assault, and little peril.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>If we do not wish to build defences merely that they may be taken, and involve in their destruction the loss of both life and prestige, let us construct them upon proper principles, and we shall have no future repetitions of <placeName key="tgn,3000601" n="1.000 10" reg="cape hatteras, dare, north carolina">Hatteras</placeName> and <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName>. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>The guns were cast in obedience to law, and the early shipment of them in advance of the full completion of the forts, though not in advance of the readiness of the forts to receive their armament, was due more to the fact that the <rs>Pittsburg</rs> iron founders were bound by their contract to deliver them before receiving their pay, than to the special eagerness of the <rs>Secretary</rs> to get them off.
