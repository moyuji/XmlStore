<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> It was the fortune of <persName n="Washington,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName>, whilst conducting the <measure n="7Years" type="date">Seven Years</measure>. War of the <name>Revolution</name>, to be the object of especial hate and vengeance to the <rs>British Crown</rs>, and, at the same time, to be exposed to misrepresentation, detraction and obloquy at the hands of his own countrymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Few of us, not family with the details of the trying ordeal through which he passed, can form an adequate idea of the fiery furnace in which that great soul was tested, and from which it came forth, known and <unclear>nized</unclear> of all men, as pure gold. --There were many hours of his history in which it seemed far more probable that he would die the death of a felon and be only remembered as the unskillful and unsuccessful leader of an insane revolt, than become the admiration of all nations and of all ages, and be described by the pen of <num value="1">one</num> of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>'s most <unclear>ed</unclear> nobles in words like these: &#x0022;Surely <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> was the greatest man that ever lived in this world uninspired by <unclear>vine</unclear> wisdoms unsustained by supernatural virtue.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> It is difficult to realize that the man of whom this is now said, even in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, was once ill-stressed, harassed and presented by his own countrymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>No human eye penetrated the secret chambers of that great soul to see the poignant wounds of the spirit, and how it was compelled to wrestle with and overcome its private grief at the same moment that it above the weight of a nation's burthens and marshalled it the way to victory and independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The sorrows of the great have few who appreciate, few who sympathize with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>They are supposed to be exalted above the lot of common suffering; they are too proud to reveal the vultures that are tugging at their heartstrings and ask the compassion and support of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>And <unclear></unclear> the fortitude and virtue of a man in high position, struggling with adversity, and, what is more painful to bear, misunderstanding and obloquy, when he has reason to expect confidence and regard, is a spectacle which appeals more to the admiration of good and heroic minds than those sorrows which lie upon the surface, and which attract at once the sympathy and consolations of the world. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> We have never been of those who attempted to make a demigod or a Washington of the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>We know that, like other men, he is fallible; that he can err; has erred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>But we will not, in this dark hour of national distress, felt by him as keenly, we doubt not as by the most sensitive of his countrymen, help to add to his afflictions by the voice of reproach and denunciation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>We will not make him the scapegoat of the nation's misfortunes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>We must have the evidence all before us that be ordered this and that unfortunate movement before we bring in a verdict of guilty against <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>. &#x0022;They say&#x0022; and &#x0022;the reliable gentleman&#x0022; will not do forus. &#x0022;They say&#x0022; is a notorious har, and &#x0022;the reliable gentleman&#x0022; is generally an ass or a knave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Wiro put him where he is?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Who made him <rs type="role2">President</rs> by acclamation?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Who fabricated this idol?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The very people who are now called upon to chop it into firewood!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>How do we know that any other idol which the same hands construct will be any more a good?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/><persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> is the creation, not the creator of the <name>Revolution</name>; and if the <name>Revolution</name> fails it is as fair to attribute <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> it to its own inherent weakness as the incompetency of its chief agent; neither of which would be true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>It will be time enough to discuss the cause when the effect is produced, and if we are faithful, united and determined that we can never be. In any event, this dark hour is the last in which we will saddle the <rs>President</rs> with the responsibility of all our misfortunes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>In the first place, we do not believe he is responsible; in the next, whilst <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> fancies he has his clutches upon his throat, we will not say &mdash; we cannot say with truth--&#x0022;Yes, <orgName n="Father Abraham" type="newspaper">Father Abraham</orgName>, that is the chief sinner; accept him as a victim, and restore us to thy favor.&#x0022; On the contrary, we can tell the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> that we are all as great offenders as the <rs>President</rs> of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, who is but our servant and our agent; and that if this war of defence has been conducted with as signal humanity and moderation as skill and valor it is because our servant and our agent has steadily maintained, under the most extraordinary provocation, the humanity and moderation of the <rs>Southern</rs> character. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> But if <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> cannot claim the credit of inaugurating this Revolution; if he is but the honored instrument selected by the people themselves for their chief; if he has manifested a persistent desire to harmonize and alleviate the horrors of war, he has conducted his administration of affairs with as much judgment, energy and devotion to the cause as any other man who could have been selected for his position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Who could have done better?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Let us hear the name of the man, and also the reason why the public intelligence did not select that man for the <name>Presidency</name> instead of the present incumbent?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>We have no doubt that we did the best we could in making <persName n="President,Mister,Davis,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="default:President,Davis,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Davis</foreName> <surname>President</surname></persName>, and that he has tried to do the best he could in the <name>Presidency</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>We see no more reason in attributing to him all the disasters in the <rs>West</rs> than all the glories in the <rs>East</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>If we are true to ourselves, the <rs>Ship</rs> of State will yet ride the waves buoyant and victorious; but if she goes down, let us refrain from pelting the helmsman, whom we ourselves put at the wheel of ship which we ourselves built and launched, and meet our fate with at least the fortitude and resignation of Turks, if not of Christians. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> &#x0022;On the afternoon of the <dateStruct value="--28"><day reg="28">28th</day></dateStruct>, the entire command reached <placeName key="tgn,2335379" n="1.000 11" reg="fort lyon, bent, colorado">Fort Lyon</placeName>, a distance of <hi rend="italics"><measure n="260miles" type="distance">two hundred and sixty miles</measure>, in less than <measure n="6days" type="date">six days</measure>,</hi> and so quietly and expeditiously had the march been made that the command at the fort were taken entirely by surprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>When the vanguard appeared in sight, it was reported that a body of <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indians</rs> was approaching, and precautions were taken for their reception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>No <num value="1">one</num> upon the route was permitted to go in advance of the column, and persons who it was suspected would spread the news of the advance were kept under surveillance until all danger from that source was past. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> &#x0022;At <placeName key="tgn,2335379" n="1.000 11" reg="fort lyon, bent, colorado">Fort Lyon</placeName> the force was strengthened by about <num value="250">two hundred and fifty</num> men of the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 1">First regiment</orgName>, and at <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time> in the evening the command set out for the <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> village.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The course was due north, and their guide was the <name>Polar</name> star.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>As daylight dawned they came in sight of the <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> camp, after a forced midnight march of <measure n="42miles" type="distance">forty-two miles</measure>, in <measure n="8hours" type="date">eight hours</measure>, across the rough, unbroken plain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>But little time was required for preparation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The forces had been divided and arranged for battle on the march, and just as the sun rose they dashed upon the enemy with yells that would put a Camanche army to the blush.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Although utterly surprised, the savages were not unprepared, and for a time their defence told terribly against our ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Their main force rallied and formed in line of battle on the bluffs beyond the <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>, where they were protected by rudely-constructed rifle-pits, from which they maintained a steady fire until the shells from <orgName type="company" n="Company C">company C</orgName>'s (<orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 3">Third regiment</orgName>) howitzers began dropping among them, when they scattered and fought each <num value="1">one</num> for himself, in genuine <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> fashion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>As the battle progressed, the field of carnage widened until it extended over not less than <measure n="12miles" type="distance">twelve miles</measure> of territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indians</rs>, who could, escaped or searched themselves; and by <time value="3oclock">3 o'clock</time> in the afternoon the carnage had ceased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>It was <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> estimated that between <num value="3">three</num> and <num value="400">four hundred</num> of the savages got away with their lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Of the balance, there were neither wounded nor prisoners.
