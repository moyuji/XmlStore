<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> --The <orgName n="Confederate States Congress" type="congress">Congress of the Confederate States</orgName> have, by a joint resolution, invited me to appoint a day of public fasting, humiliation and prayer, with thanksgiving to Almighty <name n="God" type="God">God</name>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> It is our solemn duty, at all times, and more especially in a season of public trial and adversity, to acknowledge our dependence on His mercy, and to bow in humble submission before His footstool confessing our manifold sins, supplicating His gracious pardon, imploring His Divine help, and devoutly rendering thanks for the many and great blessings which He has vouchsafed to us. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> The final extinction of <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slavery in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, which would follow the overthrow of the <rs>Confederate</rs> cause, would be an experiment in philanthropy, from the results of which the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> would be as likely to suffer as the people who are to be robbed of their laborers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> When a proud and high-spirited race, like that which for <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> has struggled so heroically for its rights, shall be deprived of liberty and independence, their anguish and humiliation cannot be increased or embittered by the loss of property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>When they can no longer walk the earth as freemen, it would be a poor consolation that they could still be permitted to retain an institution which has ever been more valuable to their enemies than themselves, and which, even if it gave them a bare support, would increase the wealth and greatness of their oppressors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The reflection that he is a slave himself would not be mitigated in the mind of the cotton planter by a gracious permission to have under him slaves whose labor, guided by his intelligence and experience, would render him a more profitable chattel to his new masters than he could otherwise become.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>It may be safely averred that slavery, even in the cotton States, has been a source of greater profit to the <rs>North</rs> than the <rs>South</rs>, which, with all its magnificent productions, has had no large cities, no colossal fortunes, no flourishing commerce and manufactures, but has been a mere tributary to <persName n="Lowell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Lowell,nomatch:0"><surname>Lowell</surname></persName>, New York and the revenues of the <rs>General Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>These have been the reservoirs into which that vast, golden tide has been poured, while the planter has lived in a modest mansion, deriving little more money from his princely possessions than would enable him to feed and clothe the <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">black</rs> members of his establishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The legislation of the <rs>General Government</rs> was always shaped to produce this result, and the moderate amount of work exacted of the laborers by their masters has borne no proportion to the outlay required for their support. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> So far as the negro is concerned, we do not expect to be believed by fanatics in the <rs>North</rs> when we aver that his physical and moral condition can only be injured,--hopelessly, we fear, --by the successful inauguration of universal abolition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>It took <measure n="500years" type="date">five hundred years</measure> to qualify our white <name>English</name> forefathers for the rights and responsibilities of freemen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>We are not prepared to believe that <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slaves can be fitted for that condition in an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Even the <rs>British Government</rs> allowed some years for the pupilage of its <placeName reg="Jamaica, Queens, New York" key="tgn,7015863">Jamaica</placeName> serfs before conferring upon them the boon of liberty; and the <rs>Northern States</rs>, when they abolished the slavery of their handful of chattels, were careful to make their legislation prospective, and, in most cases, made the period much longer than that required by the <rs>British Government</rs>. --Even with this gradual training for liberty, the result was a complete failure, so far as the moral elevation and comfort of the negro was concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Yet here they propose to liberate (and, if successful, will do it,) <num value="4000000">four millions</num> of <rs n="African" type="ethnic">Africans</rs>, without a day's preparation for the condition of freemen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>It is easy to see that the condition of the blacks of <placeName reg="Republicana Dominicana" key="tgn,7005388">St. Domingo</placeName> will be the only result of emancipation in the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> We are not so unsophisticated, however, as to imagine that the future welfare of the negro population is a matter of the slightest concern to any <num value="1">one</num> in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> but a few sincere fanatics like <persName n="Smith,,Gerrit,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="default:Smith,Gerrit,,,"><foreName>Gerrit</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>That which perplexes us in the abolition policy about to be <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> ingrafted upon the <rs>Constitution</rs> of that country is the apparent ignoring of the great <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> question, &#x0022;Will it pay?&#x0022; We can see in the measure blind fanaticism and sweet revenge; but is the gratification of vindictive sentiments worth purchasing at such a cost?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>We take it for granted that the shrewd, money-loving politicians of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> must be as well aware as any <num value="1">one</num> living in the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> States that cotton and rice cannot be as profitably cultivated by free as slave labor; if, indeed, these staples can be cultivated by free labor at all. The white man cannot work in a great portion of that country, and the black man will not unless he is compelled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>If the emancipation decreed by the <orgName n="Washington Congress" type="congress">Washington Congress</orgName> is to be real, genuine freedom of the blacks, then the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, in its eagerness for vengeance upon the <rs>South</rs>, will involve itself, if successful, in the common ruin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The South will become a desert waste, and the great fountain of Northern manufacturing industry and commercial enterprise be forever dried up. <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> will obtain all she has sought by her persistent instigation of this war, and compel the world to look to her for cotton and manufactures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>We can scarcely believe that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> will consent to such a result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>On the contrary, <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> ingenuity will devise a system which, under a new name, will be the old thing in a more rigorous form than it ever before existed in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>It may be an apprenticeship, such as has been already established in such portions of the cotton States as they have already subjugated, and in which the negro receives a small sum for his labor, subject to deductions for any loss of time, the result of which often is, that when pay day comes the amount of indebtedness to the laborer is next to nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>We have not heard, however, that the yield of the staple, under the present plan, comes up to the expectations of the friends of liberty.--If not, it is easy to see that, should the cotton cultivation ever fall generally into <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> hands, some new plan must be adopted, which, perhaps retaining the name of apprenticeship, will be a system of enforced labor of the harshest kind, and produce more cotton, rice and sugar than ever before, and kill off more <rs n="African" type="ethnic">Africans</rs> than the revival of the <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slave trade can supply. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> There is no portion of the <rs>Confederate</rs> community more interested in the defence of the country than its slave population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Of all the sufferers by subjugation, their fate will be the most hopeless and irremediable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>They will sigh in vain for the <rs>Christian</rs> sympathies and physical comforts which once elevated their lot. No class of laborers in the world is as well fed and happy as they now are. No class of laborers in the world is as poorly fed and as miserable as they will become should the <name>Genius</name> of Universal Emancipation ever enfold them in its deadly embrace. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> To be saved from demagogues is <num value="1">one</num> of the prayers which the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> will hereafter put up every day. To be saved from ward committees and cross-road politicians; to be saved from candidates for Congress and the <name>Legislature</name>; to be saved from candidates for office of any kind, will be their unceasing supplication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>To be mercifully let alone; never to see a patriot; never to be complimented on their intelligence and virtue; never to feel that the simplicity of their understandings is to be made game of by place hunters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>This they will devoutly ask, and, come all other calamities, they will endeavor to submit, if this calamity can be avoided. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> All monarchs have their vicissitudes and misfortunes; but none of them all &mdash; not <persName n="Alexander,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Alexander,nomatch:0"><surname>Alexander</surname></persName>, C&#x00E6;sar, <persName n="Hannibal,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Hannibal,nomatch:0"><surname>Hannibal</surname></persName>, nor <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>,--ever came to such days of humiliation as <persName><roleName n="King">King</roleName> <foreName>People</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Only a few years ago, and he sat upon his throne, surrounded by courtiers who prostrated themselves to the earth at his feet, considered it a privilege to black his boots and powder his wig, declared that he was the most virtuous and intelligent of the sons of men, that the king could do no wrong, and that his voice was the voice of a <name n="God" type="God">god</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>He was clothed in purple and fine linen, and held a royal sceptre in his hand, and had more patronage in his gift than any king of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and permitted no man to tell him the truth, or, if he did, dismissed him <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> from his service, and lived a most jolly and satisfied life, thoroughly convinced that though other kings had come to grief, there should be no end to the dominion of <persName><roleName n="King">King</roleName> <foreName>People</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>And now, alas, poor soul, he is eating grass, like Nebuchadnezzar; asking himself for a pass, like a negro slave; dressed in an old blue coat, dodging from conscript officers, and as drooping and disconsolate as chanticleer in a hail storm; so helpless, forlorn and miserable that there are &#x0022;none so poor as do him reverence.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> If ever this deposed and unfortunate monarch be restored again to authority, he will be a sadder but a wiser man.--He will eschew the flatteries of courtiers, and esteem that man his best friend who induces him to put checks and balances upon his own authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>He will turn an evil eye upon fanatics and demagogues, and when they prate to him of his infallible virtue and intelligence, will hold up to them the bloody record of this war, and scourge them from his presence. </p> </div3>

Wherever else the paralyzing suggestions of despondency and doubt are heard, they cannot affect the iron nerves of those heroes who have borne the brunt of this war; who have endured the winter's frosts and the summer's heart; who have slept on the bare ground, have lived on the coarsest food, marched weary miles in bare feet, poured out their blood like summer rain, and stood like a living wall between their country and its enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>These are the men who send forth words of hope and cheer and high resolve, and whose heroic souls, like the &#x00C6;olian harp, give forth stronger strains as the tempest increases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Whatever others may dream, subjugation is a word which is not found in their vocabulary, and which it would not be safe for friend or foe to utter in their presence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>They proclaim their fixed and unchangeable determination to conquer or die; and it is the army which is the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>They have no thought of permitting all their labors, privations, perils, to go for naught, nor of suffering the blood of their fallen comrades to cry in vain from the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Whatever others may do, the heroes of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> neither intend nor desire to survive their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>They love her, and they believe in her also; their faith and hope are equal to their valor and devotion, and their trust in <name n="God" type="God">God</name> is firm and unwavering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/> <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>: A discussion of the resolution might properly include the whole conduct of the <rs>Confederate</rs> civil administration and the operations of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>The civil administration has been so signal a failure, and is so dead in the popular affection, that I shall forbear to drag the lifeless <rs>Hector</rs> around the walls of our <placeName reg="Troy, Rensselaer, New York" key="tgn,7014660">Troy</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>The chief characteristic of that administration is, that it has separated the <rs>Government</rs> from the people, and has made a more vigorous and effective war on the resources of the country than it has made on the public enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>I do not believe that such was the design of the men in authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>I do not doubt their patriotism or earnest desire to succeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>Such has been the effect of the public measures, to the deplorable extent seen in the well-known fact that in this agricultural country--<num value="1">one</num> of the richest on earth &mdash; the production of provisions is so reduced that the public sentiment, most conspicuously, is a painful anxiety for continued subsistence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>The atrocious sentiment expressed in the <orgName n="African Church" type="church">African Church</orgName> by <persName n="Benjamin,the Honorable,Judah,P.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="default:Benjamin,Judah,P.,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">Hon.</roleName> <foreName>Judah</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Benjamin</surname></persName>, that the people have no rights, and all belong to the <rs>Government</rs>, is the exact exponent of the administrative policy which has alienated the people from the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>That other idea, expressed at the same time by <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00035" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, that <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> might be captured and yet no remediless ill ensue to our cause, is another phosphorescent emanation from passionate imbecility which can float and flare only in the socket of a disordered imagination; and such delusive light ought to be put out.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>Afterwards, when the balances in the chances of war were hanging in equipoise, and a peace party, to all appearances, <milestone unit="column" n="6"/> was gaining in the <rs>North</rs>, he went with his &#x0022;offensive-defensive&#x0022; into <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, and roused the enemy and united the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>When the people were lending all the labor of the country, and abstracting it from the production of tobacco and cotton to produce subsistence, a scheme of impressment to supply the army was inaugurated, which has annoyed, and irritated, and discouraged the producers, until they have been forced, most reluctantly, to discover that the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities do actually believe that the community &mdash; unrewarded adequately for their labor, and not allowed subsistence for themselves,--will, nevertheless, continue to produce subsistence for the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>Space fails to tell <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> of the sad story of the loss of confidence by the people in the <name>Administration</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/> Our military operations have elicited the admiration of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>Our army has gathered to its flag extensive renown, and to the fields of its gallantry immortal glory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>But that army cannot be sustained without a civil administration of wisdom as sagacious as comprehensive, and which shall display its enlarged and well-directed exertions with quickly-effective energy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>We have nothing now left of any life to assure hope and kindle and keep expectation alive but that army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>That army, courageous and unconquered, as it is, if supported adequately by the civil administration, as it might be, will find <hi rend="italics">in the extent of our country</hi> an unfailing resource, affording all else that is requisite to give it a victorious career to a triumphant treaty of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>That extent of country, if the civil administration can be got into competent hands, will be an invulnerable shield against any force the public enemy can bring against us to subjugate us. I will say no more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>If what I have said shall have success whereunto it is addressed, we will win the great success of independence and self-government.
