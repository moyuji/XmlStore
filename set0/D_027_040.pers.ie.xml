<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/> For <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> past there has not been a rumor in circulation to furnish a theme for gossip, nor have any exciting events occurred to form the staple of a readable article on the &#x0022;situation&#x0022; and the progress of the war. The consequence is, we have very little to give in this department this morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Like the impatient mariner, who, in a dead calm, looks aloft and whistles for a breeze, we might have whistled in vain for news &mdash; it would not have come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/> The shelling of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> was almost entirely suspended last week, and the people enjoyed an interval of quiet to which they had for a long time been strangers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>Various conjectures are indulged as to the reason of this cessation of a barbarous practice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>Many think the enemy has removed his heavy guns, having become somewhat conscientious upon the subject of shelling a city known to be occupied only by women and children, and aged, unarmed men. Hardly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>A <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> has no conscience, and particularly a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> like <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00086" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, whose entire military reputation is staked upon the success of his present enterprise.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/> The heavy firing heard down the river on Saturday was caused by an engagement between the enemy's gunboats and our iron-clads, in which our land batteries participated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>The enemy, it appears, had commenced cutting a canal across the narrow neck of land formed by a bend in the <rs>James</rs> and known as <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> Gap; and the object being supposed to be to flank our position at <placeName reg="Howlett">Howlett</placeName>'s, our forces determined to interrupt their digging operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>Our fleet opened at <time value="7am">seven o'clock A.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were driven from a portion of their works, and the firing ceased at <time value="8pm">eight o'clock P.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>It appears that it was determined to attack <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00115" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> on his left, and for this purpose <persName n="Logan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00116" reg="mostcommon:Logan,nomatch:0"><surname>Logan</surname></persName>'s, <persName n="Blair,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00117" reg="mostcommon:Blair,J.,D.,,:1"><surname>Blair</surname></persName>'s and <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Dodge,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00118" reg="mostcommon:Dodge,nomatch:0"><surname>Dodge</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName> were shifted from the left to the right to make the assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>To cover this movement, a general advance of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> skirmishers along the whole line was made on the <num value="27" type="ordinal">27th</num> and was repulsed, as, the correspondent thinks, was expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>This device, however, did not seem to deceive <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00119" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName>, who also massed troops where the assault was to have been delivered, and pounced on <persName n="Logan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00120" reg="mostcommon:Logan,nomatch:0"><surname>Logan</surname></persName> before he got into position, whipping him and going back to his works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>After this disaster, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> determined not to make the proposed assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>The correspondent winds up with the usual consolation, that &#x0022;the loss of the rebels was nearly equal to ours.&#x0022; These disasters in front, and the inability to flank <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00125" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName>, seem to have opened the eyes of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>The Board of Supervisors yesterday came to the conclusion, by a formal vote, not to send agents to the rebel States for the purpose of recruiting among the accessible colored population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>The decision is <num value="1">one</num> supported by various valid reasons, without requiring a recourse to be had to imputations on the fighting qualities of the negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>The disaster suffered by the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 9">Ninth army corps</orgName> on the morning of <date>Saturday</date>, the <dateStruct value="--30"><day reg="30">30th ultimo</day></dateStruct>, is not a pertinent argument against the policy of employing black troops-- not more pertinent, at least, than the accidental success of the <orgName n="Colored Division" type="division">colored division</orgName> would have been a sound argument on the other side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>The majority of the <name>Supervisors</name> seem to think otherwise; or rather, instead of taking the simple ground that negroes are not to be had in numbers sufficient to make up more than the merest fraction of the call, for reinforcements, they choose to make a party vote of it.--This is unwise, to say the least.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>It should be suffi- <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> cient, surely, for those who have the responsibility of dealing with this question, to know that dependence upon negro recruits, even in the matter of filling up the enrollment lists, would prove a delusion.
