<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>He concludes as follows: </p> <cit><q rend="break">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> The immediate question now presented is, peace or war. Whether the right of a State or States to dissolve connection with the federal system be a reserved right, or <num value="1">one</num> growing out of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, or the right of revolution; the great fact lies before us, that the act has been done; and we are not permitted to doubt that in a few weeks <num value="7">seven</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> States, containing a larger population than the <num value="13">thirteen</num> Colonies at the epoch of the <name>Revolution</name>, will have withdrawn from the <rs>Union</rs> and declared their independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Under whatever name disguised, a collision of arms with them will be war. </p> </q><bibl n="Vice-President John C. Breckenridge"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> The dominant party here, rejecting everything, proposing nothing, are pursuing a policy which under the name of &#x0022;enforcing the laws&#x0022; and &#x0022;punishing traitors,&#x0022; threatens to plunge the country into all the calamities of civil war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> The <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName> cannot be preserved by arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The attempt would unite the <rs>Southern States</rs> in resistance, while in the <rs>North</rs> a great multitude of true and loyal men never would consent to shed the blood of our people in the name and under the authority of a violated compact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>A serious collision upon existing issues would destroy whatever hope may yet remain of preserving or restoring the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>An attempt to hold it together by the bayonet would exceed any thing yet recorded in the annals of human madness and folly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>It would bring on a war of unexampled ferocity, in which every vital principle of the <rs>Union</rs> would disappear forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>If the <rs>South</rs> should succeed in maintaining her independence, the fends and animosities engendered by the contest between the sections would be transmitted to succeeding generations, while, if she should be subjugated, the <rs>Government</rs> would become in form and in fact consolidated, and would soon reach the usual historical termination in a military despotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>But her subjugation is impossible without extermination; and that is impossible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> And yet the danger of civil war is imminent, unless it shall be arrested by prompt and energetic action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>If, before the passions of men become aroused, and a series of untoward events drift us into strife, <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and the other border States shall calmly and firmly present a united front against it, I believe it may be arrested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/><num value="15">Fifteen</num> States are potent to prevent war. This, too, would strengthen all the true men in the <rs>Northern States</rs> who resist the atrocious policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The force party believe that <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and other Southern States are seriously divided on this subject.--Unless this can be quickly shown to be a delusion, it may become the parent of a brood of woes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> The wisdom of the <name>Legislature</name> will doubtless provide whatever is needful; yet, at a time like this, it becomes the duty, as it is the right, of every man to express his opinions; and, as <num value="1">one</num> citizen of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>, I give my voice for a <orgName n="State Convention" type="convention">State Convention</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>It is only by the direct action of the several States, in their sovereign capacity, that anything effectual can now be done; and, for <num value="1">one</num>, I desire that <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> may have an opportunity to determine, in the most solemn manner, her judgment of her rights, and her attitude in the present condition of affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>She has not been an inactive nor inglorious member of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>; she is in the presence of great and startling events, and it is not her nature to sit in listless apathy, borne along by rapid currents, without the power to direct her course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The &#x0022;calamity&#x0022; of which he speaks &mdash; firing the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gun &mdash; has already occurred: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> I pray the authorities and people of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> to put aside passion, and hear patiently and thoughtfully what I have to say upon the present critical position of our beloved State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The chances are that I am wrong in my views; for, so far as I have been enabled to collect the popular sentiment in this quarter, at least <num value="8">eight</num> out of <num value="10">ten</num> of the wisest heads of the land are against me, and I have reached that period of life when the wisdom of age begins to give place to its weaknesses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>But the correctness of opinions is not to be estimated by number, or by age, but by the standard of reason; and to this standard I would respectfully invite all who differ with me. This much is certain, that almost every man with whom I have conversed upon the points of difference between us, shows manifest excitement &mdash; the poorest accompaniment of reason and argument that could be selected from the armory of mind. </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> It seems to be generally understood (and approved of,) that if the <rs type="place">Harriet Lane</rs> attempts to enter this port she will be fired into; and, if rumor is to be credited, this is to be done without parley or explanations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>If I have not lost my senses, this is the most dangerous, useless, ill-advised measure which could possibly be adopted just at this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Thus far the war between <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> and the <rs>Federal Government</rs> has been constructive; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gun fired makes it actual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Thus far <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> has maintained a purely defensive position; this measure is openly aggressive, and is to draw the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> blood from a citizen of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; and, for aught that we know, from some champion of the cause of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The character in which the <rs type="place">Harriet Lane</rs> approaches us, we do not know, and cannot know, if she comes with sealed instructions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> This thing is to be done just as <num value="4">four</num> States are hastening to our embrace as fast as they can come, and when it is almost certain that all the slave States will be united with us in <num value="1">one</num> grand Confederacy in less than <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>; and after our warmest supporters among them have implored us to wait for concert of action with them, when the <rs>Northern States</rs> are still obedient to the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, and likely to be while <persName n="Buchanan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="nearbymention:Buchanan,James,,,"><surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> remains in office; when that Government is reeling, and in <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> time may become impotent for good or evil, when <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> is the peculiar object of <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> vengeance, and when they want only a tolerable pretext to visit her with a war of extermination before the other States can in due form come to her help; when all the help she can hope for is impotent at sea.--Her aggressive step will alarm the <name>States</name> which are at the point of secession, and perchance kindle dissension in their bosoms; certainly enkindle their ire against her. It will unite the <rs>North</rs> and the world against her. It will verity the dismal predictions of the submissionists, and blast the reputation of the secessionists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>It will precipitate <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> from the highest pinnacle of fame to the lowest depth of humiliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>When I think of the probability of it, my soul is so heavily burdened with the awful responsibility of the act, that I can hardly bring my thoughts to decent order, or my pen to decent style.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>If nothing else would stay the act, I would cheerfully surrender the power of speech and of hearing for the balance of my life to avert it. What do the advocates of this desperate measure promise themselves from it? &#x0022;It will unite the <rs>Southern States</rs>.&#x0022; Are they not united already?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Do not the rankest cowards say there must be resistance?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Does <num value="1">one</num> of them disapprove of the step which <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> has taken, save as to time?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>And has she not, up to this time, repelled the objections to her haste?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Her people forced her to quick secession; and here they were satisfied with dispatch, and perfectly willing to await the action of her sister States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Their representatives have been in no hurry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Why, then, just as we are about to reap the best fruits of our labors, are we going to become rash indeed, and fling them away for the apples of <placeName key="tgn,7016893" n="1.000 1" reg="">Sodom</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Take away the apology of &#x0022;uniting the <rs>South</rs>,&#x0022; and the act stands before the world without excuse. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> You cannot say that the <rs type="place">Harriet Lane</rs> comes with a warlike intent; and if you could, firing into her is not going to defeat her intent, or advance the independence of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> the thousandth part of a hair's breadth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/><milestone unit="column" n="2"/> But it will furnish your enemy with an admirable apology for filling your harbor with armed ships, turning <placeName key="tgn,2096786" n="1.000 14" reg="sumter, sumter, south carolina">Sumter</placeName> upon <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Moultrie</placeName>, laying waste your city, and lining your coast with <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> hirelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Of this I informed you on the same evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>I stated to you my reason for this suspension, which you knew, from its nature, would be speedily removed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>In consequence of your request, however, I promised that these orders should not be renewed &#x0022;without being previously considered and decided in Cabinet.&#x0022; This promise was faithfully observed on my part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>In order to carry it into effect, I called a special Cabinet meeting on <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct>, <date value="1861-01-02">2d January, 1861,</date> in which the question of sending reinforcements to <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> was amply discussed both by yourself and others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>The decided majority of opinions was against you.--At this moment the answer of the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> &#x0022;Commissioners&#x0022; to my communication to them of <date value="12-31">31st December</date> was received and read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/> As against assault from the water, it is defended by an ample number of <num value="32">thirty-two</num>-pounders, much better mounted, and in a much higher state of efficiency, than any <num value="1">one</num> had supposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>Not simply the casemates, but the quarters at present occupied by the officers and privates, are bomb-proof &mdash; the arched ceilings, <measure n="13feet" type="distance">thirteen feet</measure> in thickness, and covered with a stiff bank sod. The open area within the fort is not paved; the earth covered with a yielding sod, formed by grass and mud thrown upon what was originally a sand-bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>If a bed had been artistically prepared for the purpose of receiving, capturing and utterly demoralizing a shell, it could not have been better devised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>A shell falling upon it must be buried in the sand beneath from <num value="2">two</num> to <measure n="8feet" type="distance">eight feet</measure>, and by the sod above will be stripped of the power even of throwing sand into the eyes; if, indeed, the fuse should not be extinguished and the shell should explode.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>The shells, to dodge which in their descent became after a while rather a pleasurable excitement, buried themselves in the sand; their fuses were generally extinguished, and the casualties resulting from their explosion, when they did explode, were but few.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>That hope has been diminished by every hour of delay; and as the prospect of a bloodless settlement fades away, the public distress becomes more and more aggravated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>As evidence of this, it is only necessary to say that the <name>Treasury</name> notes authorized by the act of <date value="12-17">17th (seventeenth) December</date> last were advertised according to the law, and that no responsible bidder offered to take any considerable sum at par at a lower rate of interest than <num value="0.12">twelve per cent.</num> From these facts it appears that, in a Government organized like ours, domestic strife, or even a well-grounded fear of civil hostilities, is more destructive to our public and private interests than the most formidable foreign war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/> In my annual Message I expressed the conviction, which I have long deliberately held, and which recent reflection has only tended to deepen and confirm, that no State has a right, by its own act, to secede from the <rs>Union</rs>, or throw off its Federal obligations at pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>I also declared my opinion to be, that even if that right existed, and should be exercised by any State of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, the <orgName n="Department of the Executive" type="government">Executive department</orgName> of this Government had no authority, under the <rs>Constitution</rs>, to recognize its validity by acknowledging the independence of such State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>This left me no alternative, as the <rs>Chief Executive</rs> officer under the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, but to collect the public revenue and to protect the public property, so far as this might be practicable, under existing laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>This is still my purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>My province is to execute, and not to make the laws. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/> It belongs to Congress exclusively to repeal, to modify, or to enlarge their provisions, to meet exigencies as they may occur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>I possess no dispensing power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>I certainly had no right to make aggressive war upon any State; and I am perfectly satisfied that the <rs>Constitution</rs> has wisely withheld that power even from Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>But the right and the duty to use military force defensively against those who resist the <rs>Federal</rs> officers in the execution of their legal functions, and against those who assail the property of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, is clear and undeniable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/> But the dangerous and hostile attitude of the <name>States</name> towards each other has already far transcended and cast in the shade the ordinary Executive duties already provided for by law, and has assumed such vast and alarming proportions as to place the subject entirely above and beyond Executive control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>The fact cannot be disguised, that we are in the midst of a great revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>In all its various bearings, therefore, I commend the question to Congress, as the only human tribunal, under <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, possessing the power to meet the existing emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>To them exclusively belongs the power to declare war or to authorize the employment of military force in all cases contemplated by the <rs>Constitution</rs>; and they alone possess the power to remove grievances which might lead to war, and to secure peace and Union to this distracted country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>On them, and on them alone, rests the responsibility. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/> The Union is a sacred trust left by our revolutionary fathers to their descendants, and never did any other people inherit so rich a legacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>It has rendered us prosperous in peace and triumphant in war. The national flag has floated in glory over every sea. Under its shadow <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> citizens have found protection and respect in all lands beneath the sun. If we descend to considerations of purely material interest, when, in the history of all time, has a Confederacy been bound together by such strong ties of mutual interest?--Each portion of it is dependent on all, and all upon each portion, for prosperity and domestic security.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>Free trade throughout the whole supplies the wants of <num value="1">one</num> portion from the productions of another, and scatters wealth everywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>The great planting and farming States require the aid of the commercial and navigating States to send their productions to domestic and foreign markets, and to furnish the naval power to render their transportation secure against all hostile attacks. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/> Should the <rs>Union</rs> perish in the midst of the present excitement, we have already had a <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> sad foretaste of the universal suffering which would result from its destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>The calamity would be severe in every portion of the <rs>Union</rs>, and would be quite as great, to say the least, in the <rs>Southern</rs> as in the <rs>Northern States</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/> The greatest aggravation of the evil, and that which would place us in the most unfavorable light both before the world and posterity, is, as I am firmly convinced, that the secession movement has been chiefly based upon a misapprehension at the <rs>South</rs> of the sentiments of a majority in several of the <rs>Northern States</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/> Let the question be transferred from political assemblies to the ballot-box, and the people themselves would speedily redress the serious grievances which the <rs>South</rs> have suffered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>But, in heaven's name, let the trial be made before we plunge into armed conflict upon the mere assumption that there is no other alternative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>Time is a great conservative power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>Let us pause at this momentous point and afford the people, both <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, an opportunity for reflection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>Would that <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> had been convinced of this truth before her precipitate action!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>I therefore, appeal through you to the people of the country to declare in their might that the <rs>Union</rs> must and shall be preserved by all constitutional means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>I most earnestly recommend that you devote yourselves exclusively to the question how this can be accomplished in peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>All other questions when compared with this, sink into insignificance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>The present is no time for palliations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>Action, prompt action, is required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>A delay in Congress to prescribe or to recommend a distinct and practical proposition for conciliation may drive us to a point from which it will be almost impossible to recede. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/> A common ground on which conciliation and harmony can be produced is surely not unattainable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>The proposition to compromise by letting the <rs>North</rs> have exclusive control of the <rs type="place">Territory</rs> above a certain line, and to give Southern institutions protection below that line, ought to receive universal approbation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>In itself, indeed, it may not be entirely satisfactory; but when the alternative is between a reasonable concession on both sides and a destruction of the <rs>Union</rs>, it is an imputation upon the patriotism of Congress to assert that its members will hesitate for a moment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/> Even now the danger is upon us. In several of the <name>States</name> which have not yet seceded, the forts, arsenals and magazines of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have been seized. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/> This is by far the most serious step which has been taken since the commencement of the troubles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>This public property has long been left without garrisons and troops for its protection, because no person doubted its security under the flag of the country in any State of the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/> Besides, our small army has scarcely been sufficient to guard our remote frontiers against <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> incursions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>The seizure of this property, from all appearances, has been purely aggressive and not in resistance to any attempt to coerce a State or States to remain in the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/> At the beginning of these unhappy troubles, I determined that no act of mine should increase the excitement in either section of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>It the political conflict were to end in civil a war, it was my determined purpose not to commence it, nor even to furnish an excuse for it by any act of this Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>My opinion remains unchanged, that justice as well as sound policy requires us still to seek a peaceful solution of the questions at issue between the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>Entertaining this conviction, I refrained even from sending reinforcements to <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00058" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,Robert,,,:2"><roleName n="Major">Maj.</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> who commanded the forts in <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston harbor</placeName>, until an absolute necessity for doing so should make itself apparent, lest it might unjustly be regarded as a menace of military coercion, and thus furnish, if not a provocation, at least a pretext for an outbreak on the part of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>No necessity for these reinforcements seemed to exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>I was assured by distinguished and upright gentlemen of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> that no attack upon <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00059" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,Robert,,,:2"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> was intended, but that, on the contrary, it was the desire of the <rs>State</rs> authorities, as much as it was my own, to avoid the fatal consequences which must eventually follow a military collision. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/> &#x0022;I will add as my opinion that many things convinced me that the authorities of the <rs>State</rs> designed to proceed to a hostile act, (evidently referring to the orders, dated <date value="12-11">December 11,</date> of the late <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>) Under this impression I could not hesitate that it was my solemn duty to move my command from a fort which I probably could not have held longer than <num value="48">forty-eight</num> or <measure n="60hours" type="date">sixty hours</measure> to this <num value="1">one</num>, where my power of resistance is increased to a very great degree.&#x0022; </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/> The want of efficient laws for the protection of game in this State has never presented itself with more force to the true sportsman than during the season which is just drawing to a close, for whilst upland game has been more abundant than for several years, it has been pursued and killed with more recklessness than we have ever known it before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>The arts of man have been exhausted to entrap it, and without regard to size, age or condition, a wholesale butchery has been going on in many districts of the <rs>State</rs>, which in a few years will totally annihilate the game and bring the setter and fowling-piece into utter disuse, at the same time rob the table of the <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginian</rs> of its greatest delicacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>Upland shooting, or that which is confined to game found in the field and forest such as quail (commonly called partridge,) pheasant, (or ruffed grouse,) wild turkey and the common hare, is becoming so popular with all ages and classes, especially the large landed proprietors, who are our principal legislators, that we have wondered why laws for the protection of game have not been passed, setting forth such restrictions and penalties as will enforce obedience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>With these remarks we introduce the following hints from a correspondent: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/> Experience has taught all who have successfully followed the upland game of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> that the <date value="10-15">15th of October</date> is as early as it should be pursued, and that the <date value="01-15">15th of January</date> should close the season at the outside, for reasons obvious to any observer of the history of the birds and beasts of the field and forest of <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>Most birds at all prized for the delicious food they afford, pair off early in the spring and in the later part of winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>The quail and pheasant commence building the <dateStruct value="-05-1"><day reg="1">first</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, and the time of incubation is said, by the best authorities, to be from <num value="25">twenty-five</num> to <measure n="30days" type="date">thirty days</measure>. So their broods can scarcely be-grown be fore the middle of <dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>The same dates may, with safety, be observed with reference to the wild turkey and common hire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>The former is not well grown so soon, but is very tender and delicious at this season, and can be successfully followed with dogs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>Early in the season, to those well versed in the haunts and habits of the quail much good sport is afforded in the corn-fields near brush wood and in stubble and heavy rag weed cover.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>Later in the season they are apt to feed where dead grass, and clover seed are plentiful, near wooded or ivy cliffs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>They feed from early dawn until the fore noon, keeping close to cover until late in the afternoon, when they are less shy and lie better to dogs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>The pheasant can be found in autumn, in mountain forests near running streams, stand well to properly trained dogs, fly straight but very swift, yet afford an easy shot to <num value="1">one</num> expert in the use of the fowling-piece and accustomed to their haunts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>They are, however, almost extinct in the eastern portion of the <rs>State</rs>; out good sport can be had at the proper season yet in <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName> and other counties bordered by the <rs type="place">Blue Ridge</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>The hare is easily killed, and affords some sport when properly equipped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>They are followed in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> with curs of high and low degree, &#x0022;who got pell mell&#x0022; to work, with very little instinct, but man are in the course of the day to drive you many good shots, where an expert can make a good bag in a few hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>For quail and pheasant shooting, we think a brace of thoroughly-trained &#x0022;setters&#x0022; preferable to &#x0022;pointers.&#x0022; as they possess more endurance and find their game with greater case and rapidity, though pointers may be the stauncher of the <num value="2">two</num>, and more easily subdued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>We have shot over both and for general work in the field where all the qualities of a properly-trained dog are useful, and where marshy cover is to be beat, we should decide in favor of the setter, though the best brace of dogs we have ever known was a pointer and a setter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>Let every sportsman be ware of mixed breeds, for they are an abomination, and are sure to lack some good and prominent point, often indispensable. </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/> A good gun is an important consideration; and we have found no better fowling pieces than the laminated steel guns imported and furnished by <num value="1">one</num> of our townsmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>For general shooting, we would prefer a <measure n="30inch" type="distance">thirty-inch</measure> barrel with <num value="13">thirteen</num> gauge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>We hope the day is not far distant when our citizens will look nearer home for supplies of this kind, and cease to show their ignorance by placing a veto upon everything purchased and produced out of Yankeedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>We have used <num value="1">one</num> of the laminated guns purchased here, by the side of a Northern sold piece for a larger price, and generally bagged as many birds, at as long distances, as our friend with Northern proclivities. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/> There are many other topics perfectly legitimate under this head; but as this humble paper was only intended to arouse a spirit in some <num value="1">one</num> else better <sic>pos ed</sic> in such matters than your correspondent to make an effort in the <name>Legislature</name>, now in session, in getting a law passed protecting our game, now rapidly disappearing by the butchery of pot-hunters and others in high places styling themselves sportsmen, but who disgrace the name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>I leave the subject with the hope that in this I will not be disappointed. </p> </div3>
