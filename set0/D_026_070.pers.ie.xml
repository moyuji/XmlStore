<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/> We find in the editorial columns of the New York <hi rend="italics">Dilly News,</hi> of the <dateStruct value="--9"><day reg="9">9th inst.</day></dateStruct> an article entitled &#x0022;Popularity of the <rs>War</rs>,&#x0022; which sets forth in forcible and graphic terms, the fast waning war spirit of the <rs>Northern</rs> people, and tears from the face of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00063" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and his crew, the veil of deceit and hypocrisy, with which they have to long gulled the <rs>Northern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>It is a bold paper for a New York latitude, and the fact that its publication is tolerated by the <rs>Washington</rs> tyrant, shows that a wonderful revolution is taking place in Northern sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>It is as follows: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/> There has been no bugbear more alarming to the limit and unorganized friends of peace than the <hi rend="italics">pretended &#x0022;popularity&#x0022; of the war.</hi> The negro worshippers and their allies of the &#x0022;War Democracy&#x0022; know this so well that they have spared no efforts or appliances to spread and heighten <hi rend="italics">the <unclear>delu</unclear> </hi> Nothing could illustrate more fully the madness, which is now waning so fast, than the facility with which they have been able, hitherto, to impose it on the public credulity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/> We presume that no <num value="1">one</num> who knows anything of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> character, or has read the history of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> people, can honestly believe the latter to be either cowards or mercenaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>With the sad exception of a portion of the population of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, in the struggle from <dateStruct value="1819--"><year reg="1819">1819</year></dateStruct>, there is no record of their having ever shrunk from any of the duties or sacrifices imposed on them by patriotism in time of war. On the contrary, they have been so ready, always to answer to the call of country, that they have more than once mistaken for it the <hi rend="italics">false appeals</hi> of demagoguism and passion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>They have always been so willing, and often so anxious to fight, that <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> diplomacy has long characterized them, proverbially, as disturbers of the peace of nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>It was this hasty and pugnacious impulse, so peculiar to them that it could be counted on with absolute certainly, which the unprincipled contrivers of our present suffering abused and tempted for their own unholy ends at the beginning of the war. To the enthusiasm with which the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> calls of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00064" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> were responded to, <num value="1000">thousands</num> of desolate households &mdash; tens of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of brave hearts now cold &mdash; bear mute and fearful witness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>Then, indeed, the war was popular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>Right or wrong, it appealed to the popular heart, and was answered with its best blood. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/> Let us look, now, at the contrast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>To do so, we must not go to the columns of the pensioned press of the dynasty at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>; nor to the manufacturers of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> or New York, or elsewhere, who have grown fat on the carnage of better men; nor to the traders, or jobbers, or contractors, or placement, or parasites &mdash; the myriad of jackals who feed on the bloody offal of the strife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>We have only to contemplate the simple and naked facts, that with a population <num value="3">three</num> times that of the <name>States</name> at war with us, and a fighting population proportionately much larger &mdash; with bounties proffered such as never tempted cupidity in any war before &mdash; we are compelled to seduce foreigners from their homes to fight our battles for pay, and are driven to the still more degrading necessity of committing the honor of our flag and the vindication of our manhood to the hands of negroes, bond and free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>Not the relentless grasp of a most merciless and unconstitutional conscription nor the seduction of bounties large enough to make a poor man's fortune, can now drag or entice <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> citizens, except in numbers absolutely insignificant, to fight the battles of this war. It is insolent, as well as idle and absurd, to talk of the &#x0022;popularity&#x0022; of any war that can command no warmer support than this from a brave and impulsive people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>If the hearts of the people were in the war, they themselves would be in the field to fight to the death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>If they sincerely believed it to be a war in which they ought to offer themselves as a sacrifice they would crowd to the very horns of the altar without threat or bribe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>That they shrink from the contest, that they will devote all the little earnings of their lives to purchase exemption, that they cannot be tempted or forced into the ranks while there is any escape all these things tell the story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>The people do not feel any longer that the war is their war. They may support it for a little while because the <rs>Government</rs> is waging it and the flag is waved over it. Some of them may be willing it should continue, because it pays themselves or their friends large profits, or keeps up their influence, or advances their party, or flatters their vanity, or gratifies their rancor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>But the great current of public feeling and opinion runs in its favor no longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>It has now <unclear></unclear> hold on public enthusiasm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>Its popularity is dead </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/> In the <name>Administration</name> <unclear></unclear> is false &mdash; if it is persuaded that the popularity of the war continues, let it abandon the conscription and the bounty system and make the experiment of volunteer enlistments for a single week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>I hat brief space of time would suffice for the entire solution of the problem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>If such an experiment, however, be deemed too hazardous, let <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00065" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and his counsellors make a still simpler <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>Let them tell the people the truth for a single month, if the thing be possible, if not let them endeavor to do it for a fortnight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>Let <persName n="Chase,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00066" reg="mostcommon:Chase,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName> give us the real amount of the public debt and of his means and provisions for its payment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>Let him inform us of the amount of taxes which we must endure to avert the shame of repudiation, now, without increasing the debt a single dollar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>Instead of sea sawing between greenbacks and bonds, which appears to be the substance of his financial policy, and concocting paltry schemes for jabbing in gold on <address><street n="Wall street">Wall street</street></address>, let him trust the people, if he dare, with the facts from which they may know their own solvency or insolvency, and appeal to them to meet the issue, face to face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>Let <persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00067" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName> try if he can write <num value="1">one</num> solitary dispatch without some intentional perversion of the truth, and confine himself to the legitimate purposes of diplomatic correspondence abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>Instead of loading the files of the <orgName n="State Department" type="department">State Department</orgName> with clap-trap and misrepresentation for home consumption and deception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>Let <persName n="Stanton,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00068" reg="mostcommon:Stanton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName>, instead of flooding the country with false bulletins from irresponsible or fictitious sources, undervaluing the strength and resources of the enemy, exaggerating their wants and sufferings, multiplying their reverses and our triumphs, give himself up, for ever so brief a space, to the dissemination of the truth, which the people are entitled to have in regard to a struggle for which they are taxed to the utmost in treasure and blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>With what face can he assert the war to be the people's war, when, after having caused the press to teem with telegrams announcing the almost universal and enthusiastic re-enlistment of the veterans of the army, he has caused the <rs>President</rs> to refuse to give the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> any information on the subject, on the ground that it would be &#x0022;prejudicial to the public interest?&#x0022; If the <name>Administration</name> will not venture to pursue the plain, straightforward course we indicate, let it cease to prate of its war policy as rooted in the confidence of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>If the people uphold it, why conceal from the people what they uphold?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>Or is it that the war can be maintained in its pretended popularity only so long as the people are kept from knowing what it is and what it promises. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/> We are rejoiced to see that these considerations and others akin to them are opening so many long blinded eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>The people have begun to think for themselves at last, and there can be but <num value="1">one</num> result of their so doing, if they will but speak out fearlessly what they think.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>The war cannot bear probing in its causes, its conduct, its purposes, or its prospects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>It cannot survive the touch of free thought and free speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>The friends of peace, heretofore, have lacked boldness and confidence in themselves and their cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>Deserted at the out set by those in whom they trusted as leaders, it is scarcely to be wondered that they should have despaired, and have permitted themselves to be battled out of the expression of their conviction, nay, almost out of these convictions themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>But times have changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>The tide is now setting in the right direction, and they must take it at the flood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>The people must not a wait for men to lead them now. Humanity, civilization, the blessed teachings of Christianity, are leaders enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>The renegade of to-day will be only too happy to return as the cause of peace develops its grand proportions and its strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>Let, then, every man who wants peace, cry peace!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>Let there be no disguise, no catering for popularity, or for this influence or that, no putting on of the devil's livery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>The cause can and will take care of itself and its advocates, if they are not afraid to proclaim their allegiance to it. Let no man be fooled or frightened by the suggestion that he is bound to &#x0022;support the <rs>Government</rs>,&#x0022; or that by crying out for peace, he is &#x0022;embarrassing the <rs>Government</rs>.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/> Every citizen who has to uphold the <rs>Government</rs> with his money and his blood, has the right, nay is bound in duty, to influence its policy, by the public expression of his honest opinions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>He is bound to obey the laws, but not to smother or belie his convictions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>The talk of &#x0022;embarrassing the <rs>Government</rs>,&#x0022; is but the stereotyped jargon of despotism and servility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>Free Governments were made to be &#x027;embarrassed&#x027; by free speech and free suffrage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>It is precisely what distinguishes them from Governments which are not free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>Such &#x0022;embarrassments&#x0022; may be inconvenient sometimes, to both the people and their servants, but all inconveniences of the sort are involved in the fact, that our chief servant is a President and not an autocrat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>Let him and his Cabinet and his Congress be dealt with as servants and not bowed down to as masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>Net them bear the truth, from those to whom they will not tell it from those who made them and can and will unmake them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>Unless we greatly <unclear></unclear> the seemingly small voices to-day will be loud enough for them ere many morrows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>The people yearn for peace and they will have it. They are tired of &#x0022;military necessity&#x0022; and military rate.--They prefer the <rs>Government</rs> erected by the <rs>Constitution</rs> to a war <unclear></unclear> despotic, supported by black <unclear>jan </unclear>. They do not desire to exterminate the &#x0022;slave aristocracy&#x0022; at the <rs>South</rs>, in order to establish at the <rs>North</rs> an aristocracy of shoulder straps and cavalry boots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>They believe that the mission of this Republic is something better than <milestone unit="column" n="6"/> &#x0022;miscegenation&#x0022; and the establishment of negro equality or superiority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>They will endure taxation, privations, and sacrifices no longer, in deify the idols of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>'s hypocrisy, cupidity, and fanaticism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>They yearn for peace, we repeat, and peace they will have. </p> </div4> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>Such an event, of course, attracted an immense crowd to the ground where the scaffold was erected, which was about <measure n="1mile" type="distance">one mile</measure> northeast of the town, in a beautiful pine grove.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>Inside the ring were the workmen who had constructed the scaffold, the executioner, and a few other officials.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>The condemned was conveyed to the place of execution in a wagon, seated on his coffin, and accompanied by his spiritual advisers, and escorted by a company of cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>He appeared to be about <measure n="45years" type="date">forty-five years</measure> of age <measure n="5feet" type="distance">five feet</measure> <measure n="8inches" type="distance">eight inches</measure> high, had long, flowing whiskers, a fine head and intelligent face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>After glancing deliberately at the rope, the knot and the white cap, he threw off his hat, and indicated to the executioner that he was ready.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>The rope was then adjusted about his neck, the cap drawn over his head, and in a few moments the soul of <persName n="McGibbon,,David,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00073" reg="default:McGibbon,David,,,"><foreName>David</foreName> <surname>McGibbon</surname></persName> took its flight to that bourne whence no spine or traitor ever return.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/> From all that I can learn McGibbon desired to address the crowd, but was forbidden, for reasons best known to the authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>A few days since he partly wrote out a &#x0022;statement of facts;&#x0022; having determined to make a speech on the scaffold he destroyed the manuscripts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>He protested his innocence to the last moment; but the proof against him was overwhelming, and the <rs type="place">Court</rs>, I understand, was unanimous in its verdict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>Some of the statements in the <hi rend="italics">Mississippian</hi> in regard to his career and arrest he pronounced inaccurate.
