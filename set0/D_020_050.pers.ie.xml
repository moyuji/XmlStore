<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/> The people of the <rs>Northern States</rs> of <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> are behaving after their defeat in a manner which is somewhat unaccountable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>They do not seem at all inclined to lessen its importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>They do not affect to conceal that they have been totally and disgracefully defeated, that their opinions of their own merits and of their enemy's deficiencies were unfounded, and that, instead of a short and brilliant campaign, they must either prepare for a desperate war or give up the scheme of subjugating the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>And yet this National calamity and this grievous shame do not seem to affect them as they would affect an <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>They even take a pleasure in the sensation caused by their unparalleled defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>Excitement is to all classes a necessary daily dram, and, if they have it, it matters not whether it is bought by success or misfortune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>Then the people have so little realized the meaning of war, and they have such confidence in their own energy and fortunes, in their faculty of what they call coming <q> &#x0022;right side up'ards,&#x0022;</q> that as a community they are no more depressed by a total rout than they would be in their individual capacities by a pecuniary loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>A singular trait in human character is exhibited by their open acknowledgment to all the world of defeat, coupled with the <q>&#x0022;enthusiastic reception&#x0022;</q> which they are giving to whole regiments of volunteers, who, on pretence of their time being up, are marching homeward on the morrow of a great defeat, and on the eve of an expected advance of the <rs>Southern</rs> army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>The more aristocratic <orgName type="mil" key="NYVolunteer">New York volunteers</orgName> had returned home long before the <rs n="Battle of Bull Run" type="battle">battle at Bull Run</rs>, and now regiments from almost every State are hastening back to their respective districts, to be received with the loudest plaudits of their friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>But the most extraordinary case is that of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Patterson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00289" reg="mostcommon:Patterson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Patterson</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>If such a thing had happened to <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 1">one corps</orgName>, it might have been set down to the bad counsels of <num value="1">one</num> or more discontented spirits, or to the injudicious conduct of some commanding officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>But here it is evident that the whole volunteer army of the <rs>Northern States</rs> is worthless as a military organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>It is useless to comment on the behavior of men who, pretending to rush to arms for the salvation of their country, make off in <num value="1000">thousands</num> when the enemy come in sight, and leave their General to take care of himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>This is certainly carrying to its further limit that right of Secession which they flew to arms to punish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>In any other country such conduct would be looked upon as the extreme of baseness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>But the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> do not visit it as such, and they, perhaps, have an instinctive sense of the justice of the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>They feel how hollow has been so much of the indignation expressed by their party &mdash; how much the campaign against the <rs>South</rs> is a sham, entered into in obedience to a <q>&#x0022;sensation&#x0022; </q> policy, and offering widely from the earnest and steady resolve which animates men who are fighting for objects really dear to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>If <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> or <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> were invading the <rs>Northern States</rs>, no <num value="1">one</num> can believe that a whole <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> army would evaporate because <num value="3">three</num> calendar months were up; nor, to bring matters nearer home, can we imagine that the <name>Southerners</name> will take the rail homeward while New York rowdies and Boston Abolitionists are desolating the villages of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/> In all ages success in war has inclined to the party which is fighting for an existence, and is consequently steeled to a sterner resolve.--There is a want of this earnestness to be noticed in the conduct of the <name>Northerners</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>The completeness of the defeat, the courage of the enemy, and the panic of their own army, are not extenuated or denied in any way. There is, of course, the usual tendency to lay the blame on the commanders, and to save the self-love of the army at the expense of its chiefs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>But, making allowances for this, it is probable not only that the leaders were incompetent, but the mass of the troops felt that they were.
