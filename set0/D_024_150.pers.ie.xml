<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>It appears, even, to have compelled him to look to his rear for the means of escape from the trap in which he has been caught.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The wisdom of <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>'s plans begins to appear, and the long forecast and wide-reaching sagacity, with which he has been preparing the impending catastrophe, are every day more and more and object of admiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Compelled to form an army in the face of an enemy several times more numerous than himself, he has succeeded so far as to place himself almost on an equality with him. Knowing that procrastination was all important to <hi rend="italics">him</hi>, while it was fatal to his enemy, he has contrived to put off the day of conflict until at last he has little to apprehend from the encounter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The rivers have fallen, the sickly reason has set in, transportation is already difficult for the enemy, and will soon become impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>He foresaw this state of things, and while outsiders, who know nothing of his condition, were imputing to him every petty mishap that occurred around <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, he was steadily and calmly preparing the means of ultimate triumph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>He happened to have been born in a Northern State, and although he had married in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, had reared his children as Southern people, had resided many years among us, and had rejected the offer of a large fortune to cast in his lot with the <rs>North</rs>, there were not wanting men ungenerous enough to impute his Northern birth to him as a crime, and to &#x0022;foretell&#x0022; that upon the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> opportunity he would prove a traitor to the cause he had espoused at so great a cost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>We could never understand what occasioned this storm of hatred, except his Northern birth, the strict discipline he kept up in his camp, and his having said, or been reported to say, that if the enemy attacked <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> in force, he should be compelled to evacuate it, as unquestionably he would have been in the then unprepared condition of the place, and as we learn <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> himself says he would Next came the engagements on the Big Black, for the ill-success of which he received all the blame, although he was attacked by troops <num value="4">four</num> times as numerous as his own, while a portion of the latter shamefully abandoned him, saying that he had sold them and <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Through all these difficulties <persName n="Pemberton,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Pemberton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Pemberton</surname></persName> has fought his way like a hero.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>He has not allowed slander and detraction to make the slightest impression upon his mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>He has never wavered for a moment, and never done any act by which his loyalty could be called in question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>He has made <num value="1">one</num> of the stoutest and noblest defences of which there is any account in history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>He has made <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> as famous as <placeName key="tgn,7008813" n="1.000 1" reg="zaragoza,zaragoza,aragon,espana,europe">Saragossa</placeName>, and he will go down to posterity with Paradox.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Those who were wide mouthed against him are already ashamed of themselves for having reviled a hero.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Those who were a <hi rend="italics">little</hi> less vehement have veered around, and begin to praise him. Those who were always convinced of his courage and loyalty, but were kept silent by his ill success, begin to hold up their heads, while those who always upheld him are ready to shout for joy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>To-day, he is something very much like an idol.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Such are popular extremes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>We regard him as <num value="1">one</num> of the truest men and best officers in the service, and so we have always regarded him. He has rendered a most important service certainly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Through him, under the <rs>Supreme Power</rs>, we believe that <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> has been saved, and the dreadful consequence of severing our empire averted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Such reasoning is too pusillanimous to command the attention of a brave people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>If we are afraid to strike lest we be struck in return, we had better never have entered upon this war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>But it is false reasoning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>If we had retaliated sternly in the beginning we should have put an end to the system of out rages adopted by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>They know they will never be called to a reckoning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>They believe we are afraid to retaliate, for thus they interpret the <rs>Christian</rs> meekness of our Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>That meekness, far from softening their wrath; tends only to inflame it to the highest pitch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>They look upon our country as a game preserve, which they may enter and plunder whenever they may feel disposed to do so, without the slightest risk of prevention or punishment.
