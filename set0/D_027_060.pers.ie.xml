<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>We had hoped, and urged, that both parties should unite upon <num value="1">one</num> candidate, like <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00036" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, and thus secure the election of a pure and honest patriot, unbiased by any political prejudices, and devoted solely to the salvation of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>In this we have been disappointed. </p> </q><bibl n="The Herald"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/> The Democratic and <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> journals and orators have begun the work in a wrong spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Still, as the canvass is just opened, it is not too late for them so repent and reform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/><persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00037" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00038" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> stand upon different platforms and represent different parties; but this is no reason why they should not be treated as gentlemen by their political opponents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Let it be understood at the very outset that <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00039" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> is not &#x0022;a scoundrel,&#x0022; and that <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00040" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> is not &#x0022;a traitor,&#x0022; and we shall get through the canvass much more creditably and comfortably.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>But if these phrases are to be the key-notes of the discussion, how long will it be before <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs> and <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> will shoot and stab each other in our streets?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Already the <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi> has started the electioneering lie that <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00041" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> offered his sword to the rebels before he joined the <rs>Union</rs> army, and the <hi rend="italics">World</hi> has retorted by threatening to expose &#x0022;the infamy-- yes, that's the word, infamy &mdash; of the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName>.&#x0022;Now, what does this disgraceful style of controversy effect?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>How many votes does it win?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>It makes partisan journalism despicable and excites partisan passions; that is about all it amounts to. We insist that it shall be stopped, and we propose to take measures to stop it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/> Another bad feature of this canvass is the secret society business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>The <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs> are said to have several secret political societies, and the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> certainly have the <rs>Loyal Leagues</rs>, which are secret associations, having their headquarters in private arsenals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>All such societies are un-<rs n="American" type="group">American</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>They are unpatriotic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>They lead to disorder and to bloodshed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>If the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> have any of the virtues to which they lay claim, they will disband these leagues at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>If the <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs> are as patriotic as they profess to be, they will have nothing more to do with secret associations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>There is no issue involved in the coming election which may not be discussed openly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>No oaths, or grips, or passwords, are required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Fair, free and frank discussion is the only thing needed to settle this election satisfactorily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>Should we carry this election quietly, and should the beaten party submit peacefully, we shall have proven ourselves a great people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>This incident forces us to ask how long it is really probable that this impracticable, aimless, hopeless war will last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>Is it all likely that it will survive the present campaign?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>It cannot seriously be supposed that the <name>Northerners</name> will go on fighting forever at the cost of national bankruptcy and universal ruin and the desolation of their homes, not only without any tangible profit or advantage at present, but even without any prospect of possible benefit in the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>We speak of the desolation of Northern homes, because, as the loss in killed and wounded is at least thrice as great on their side as on that of the <rs>Confederates</rs>, there must soon be not a single family in the <rs>Federal States</rs> but what will have to mourn the death of <num value="1">one</num> or more of its members or to witness the sad spectacle of a husband, a brother, a son, painfully dragging himself about a cripple for life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>Is it creditable, is it conceivable, is it even possible, that the <rs>Federals</rs> should continue such a war much longer ! Their doing so really seems to be inconsistent with the nature of man and of things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>Man is not given to ruin himself systematically for nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>From the number of regiments which are continually marching home on the expiry of their term of service, and leaving the armies in the very crisis of a battle, it is evident enough that those who have had <num value="1">one</num> taste of the war will not enter the ranks a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>Those who have not served may, by the bribe of high bounties, by kidnapping, by enlisting them when drunk, and other notable <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> device, be induced to go forth as food for powder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>This leads to an important conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>Even the civilians themselves, who have had no taste of the realities of war, and have been accustomed to view it on its bright and romantic side, have resisted the draft by force in more than <num value="1">one</num> locality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>If the <rs>North</rs> is to depend upon mere foreign mercenaries, the war will come to an end very speedily indeed; and if it could be carried on by such means, it would be far more formidable to the <rs>Government</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> than to that at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/> As the facts in connection with the evacuation of <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> gradually unfold themselves the public mind becomes reassured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>It is already ascertained that there was no disaster, that the spirit of our men is unimpaired, and that they are as defiant now as they were the day before the evacuation took place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/><persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00172" reg="nearbymention:Hood,J.,B.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName> never believed that he could hold <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> permanently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>His great object was to hold it as long as he could, and to make the possession of it by the enemy cost him as much as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>This object has been fully attained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>The enemy has been delayed in his progress towards the <rs>South</rs> upwards of <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure>, and within that time has lost more men than the <rs>English</rs> portion of the expedition lost at the siege of <placeName reg="Sebastopol, Trinity, Texas" key="tgn,2107559">Sebastopol</placeName> &mdash; probably as many as both English and, French lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/><placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> had done its share of the duty assigned to it, and when it was no longer tenable it was evacuated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>It was taken at last by a flank movement &mdash; it never could have been taken by direct assault. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/> <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00173" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> has passed through an immense tract of country, and he has conquered as much of it as lies within the range of his guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>His course has been like that of a ship through the sea. The waves give way before it and close around its stern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>The population of the country through which <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00174" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> has advanced yielded as he came on to the mere weight of his colossal force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/><placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">West</rs> Tennessee</placeName> has already slipped from his grasp, and there is every indication that <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName> may shortly follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>In <placeName reg="Kentucky, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> a civil war is actually raging at this moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>The people of that unhappy land submitted to save their property from confiscation or destruction under the hope that they would be allowed to remain neutral in the conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>They never contemplated the probability of being forced to bear arms against their own countrymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>If they were compelled to fight, there were few of them who would not have preferred to fight on the <rs>Confederate</rs> side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>But they hoped to avoid the necessity of fighting altogether.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>They have now become &mdash; not too late, we hope, --fully aware of the folly of their choice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>They have not been able to preserve their property, for which they had sacrificed their honor, nor have they secured an exemption from military duty by submission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00175" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s emancipation proclamation has swept off their slaves into the ranks of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>Their fat cattle have become the prey of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> commissaries; their blooded horses have served to mount <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> cavalry; their fine crops have been pressed for the wants of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>As for that neutrality which <persName n="Crittenden,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00176" reg="mostcommon:Crittenden,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Crittenden</surname></persName> exhorted them to maintain, it has turned out to be as unsubstantial as moonshine in the water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>Their country is subject to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> draft, and they are expected to assist in slaughtering and enslaving their neighbors and brothers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>A portion of that spirit which distinguished <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> in other days still seems to be slumbering in the bosoms even of the <rs>Union</rs> men. They evince a disposition, since fight they must, to fight against, rather than for, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and they are said to be flocking to the standard with a zeal which no efforts of the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName> themselves could arouse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have done for us what we could not do for ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>They have made every <rs n="Kentuckian" type="group">Kentuckian</rs> who has a spark of spirit and honor remaining detest them as if each man of their nation was a personal enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>It is clear that, in passing so long a distance through the country, <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00177" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> has conquered nothing but the ground his army occupies for the time, and that on which the forts he has left in his rear are built. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/> Instead, therefore, of being depressed by the evacuation of <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>, we have every cause to exult in the progress of our cause generally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>The enemy has evidently undertaken more than he can do. He cannot hold the country over which his armies have marched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>He is compelled to concentrate to prevent disaster, and when he concentrates he abandons some portion of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>His force is not sufficient &mdash; no force that ever marched under the banner of created man would be sufficient &mdash; to hold down the enormous country he has undertaken to subjugate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>This has become more apparent during the progress of the present campaign than it ever was before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>The enemy found from the experience of the <num value="3">three</num> preceding campaigns that he could not hope to subdue the rebels unless he concentrated his forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>Accordingly, concentration has been the order of the day, and it has cost him nearly all the territory he had previously overrun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>Our prospects are far brighter now than they were this time last year, for then we had not yet recovered from the severe blow inflicted by the capture of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>This year we have received no severe blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>On the contrary, we have been almost always victorious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>Our victories, in fact, have spoiled us by making us too sensitive to a reverse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>And yet, in the nature of things, reverses must come sometimes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>We are but too happy that the present is so inconsiderable. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>History and romance will unite their strength to make his name as imperishable as the cause in which he fought.
