<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The very name was suggestive of moonlight, meditation, music, and flowers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The time of year which finds me here and the warlike aspect the town now bears unite to disappoint the realization of my early fancies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>It <sic>is is</sic> true, the place is pleasantly situated in a beautiful and bountiful portion of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, and the grass on the broad, surrounding fields even now sufficient for grazing; but who thinks of <placeName key="tgn,2031150;tgn,7013448;tgn,7013447" n="0.136 000000.5454	placename;tgn,2031150;Bowling Green, Parke, Indiana,Parke,Indiana,United States,North and Central America;0.068 000000.2727	placename;tgn,7013448;Bowling Green, Wood, Ohio,Wood,Ohio,United States,North and Central America;0.068 000000.2727	placename;tgn,7013447;Bowling Green, Warren, Kentucky,Warren,Kentucky,United States,North and Central America" reg="Bowling Green, Parke, Indiana,Parke,Indiana,United States,North and Central America;Bowling Green, Wood, Ohio,Wood,Ohio,United States,North and Central America;Bowling Green, Warren, Kentucky,Warren,Kentucky,United States,North and Central America">Bowling Green</placeName> except as the military key of the <rs type="place">Mississippi Valley</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Before that key is turned and that gorgeons valley stained by the foot of the vandals the tall grass and the rosy flowerets of spring will be woven in luxuriant wreaths for Southern herces. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> I find military men in some perplexity to appreciate the remarkable man&#x0153;uvres of <persName n="Buell,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Buell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Buell</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>From <num value="4">four</num> to <num value="8">eight</num> regiments are thrown over each day and made to re-cross at night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>What the <rs>Federal General</rs> means by this marching and counter-marching seems doubtful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The most rational interpretation appears to be to accustom his affrighted soldiery to the presence of our forces and to gradually bring them up to the <q>&#x0022;sticking point;&#x0022;</q> in other words, to inspire them with courage by degrees.

When his advance will occur nobody here can pretend to predict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>All that can be said is that whenever he chooses to practice the motto <q>&#x0022;On to nashville,&#x0022;</q> he will be met by a competent force and overwhelmed with disaster. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>As I came into the town at night, the camp-fires could be seen for miles in every direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>For <measure n="30miles" type="distance">thirty miles</measure> <name>east</name>, <name>west</name> and <name>north</name> the inevitable tents of the brave volunteers are pitched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The army under <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> is so disposed as to be most convenient to fire-wood and army supplies, and most readily mobilized in case of emergency, It may well be supposed that a great deal of skill and military genius was necessary to the perfection of these varied arrangements. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> When I visit the fortifications and the outposts I shall be able to present some facts, which, while I do not intend they shall be useful to the public enemy, may gratify the general wish on the part of <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginians</rs> for accurate information touching military operations before <placeName key="tgn,2031150;tgn,7013448;tgn,7013447" n="0.136 000000.5454	placename;tgn,2031150;Bowling Green, Parke, Indiana,Parke,Indiana,United States,North and Central America;0.068 000000.2727	placename;tgn,7013448;Bowling Green, Wood, Ohio,Wood,Ohio,United States,North and Central America;0.068 000000.2727	placename;tgn,7013447;Bowling Green, Warren, Kentucky,Warren,Kentucky,United States,North and Central America" reg="Bowling Green, Parke, Indiana,Parke,Indiana,United States,North and Central America;Bowling Green, Wood, Ohio,Wood,Ohio,United States,North and Central America;Bowling Green, Warren, Kentucky,Warren,Kentucky,United States,North and Central America">Bowling Green</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/> As the <name>Legislature</name> is now employed in devising a plan to furnish <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>'s quota of the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">confederate Army</orgName> for another campaign, and as that plan will most probably render necessary a heavy draft on the militia of the <rs>State</rs>, the question <q>&#x0022;Who are exempt?&#x0022;</q> or rather who ought to he exempted?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>becomes a very important <num value="1">one</num>; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/> That the <name>Legislature</name> should determine this question clearly and definitely, as an act of justice to the whole body of the militia, is, it seems to me, highly essential, and that it should make the subjects of exemption as few as possible is also very important.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant General</rs>, in a late report, makes the number of militiamen some <num value="130000">130,000</num> or <num value="140000">140,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>This, I presume, includes all the male citizens of the <rs>State</rs> between <num value="18">eighteen</num> and <measure n="45years" type="date">forty-five years</measure> of age, except those whose physical disability is so plain as to have prevented them from being enrolled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>Now, of this number, if I am to judge from what I hear and see, a large proportion will claim exemption on the score physical disability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>In the community in which the writer resides, there are numersous persons who have suddenly become afflicted with blindness, deatness, dameness, and many other complaints disqualifying them for military service; and such, I presume, is the case all over the <rs>State</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/> Again. the ranks of the militia are likely to be very much thinned by persons professing to be working for the <rs>Government That</rs> is, men who manage to get a job once a month-- a wagon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>a set of harness, or something of the kind &mdash; but whose regular employment is working for other, perhaps better, customers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/> Another class of would-be exempts is overseers, by far the healthiest, hardiest class of men among us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/> Now, I would have the <name>Legislature</name> to look at this matter closely and exempt only such as are in truth physically unfit to be soldiers &mdash; or whose services at home are likely to be productive of more benefit to the public than they would be in the army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/> What justice is there in making a stripling of <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> whose face has never been exposed to the sunfor and hour at a time, and who has never done any harder work in his life than measure tape and calico, do service as a soldier, while the robust man of <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure>, <measure n="5feet" type="distance">five feet</measure> <num value="10">ten</num> in his stockings, remaing at home, merely because he is an overseer What justice in making B., who doesn't complain of ill heath but who weighs only <measure n="115l." type="pounds"><num value="115">115</num> pounds</measure>, and is not able to lift his own weight, shoulder a musket, while D. who weighs <measure n="175l." type="pounds"><num value="175">175</num> pounds</measure> and can fell an ox with his flat, is exempted because he is a little hard of hearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>or has some trifling complaint which never yet to any case, produced death?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>Why take <num value="1">one</num> man from his business close his doors, and leave his family with no <num value="1">one</num> to support and provide for them and leave another at home to do <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">$100</measure> worth of work for Government and <measure n="5000dollars" type="currency">$5,000</measure> worth for his regular customers? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/> If the necessities of the country require the services of the militia let all be enrolled &mdash; so that every man may have an equal chance, If the <rs>Government</rs> requires workmen, let it employ them regularly and constantly &mdash; not give them an occasional job merely to keep them out of the army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/> I repeat, let the <name>Legislature</name> look closely into this matter of exemptions, or they will have room for continual complaint and dissatisfaction, productive of great trouble. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/> The part of the coast of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> menaced by the enemy includes about half of its ocean front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>The <rs type="place">Sounds</rs> in which it is supposed he proposes to conduct his operations are separated from the ocean by a spit of sand, pierced by a few very narrow inlets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>These Sounds are bordered by swamps, save here and there points of land a little elevated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>The arable land contiguous to the rivers emptying into the <rs type="place">Sounds</rs> is fertile, and produces heavy crops of <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> corn; but the interrening country chiefly consists of pine barrens, valuable only for the turpentine yielded so abundantly by the pine forests. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/> The towns situated upon the rivers and at or near their entrance into the <rs type="place">Sounds</rs> are all very moderate in size, and plain and old-fashioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>The largest of them is Newborn, situated on the <placeName reg="Nonse river">Nonse river</placeName>, some <placeName><distance reg="40miles">forty miles</distance> from the <rs>Southern</rs></placeName> extremity of <placeName reg="Pamlico Sound, North Carolina, North Carolina" key="tgn,1115016">Pamlico Sound</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>It has a population of only some <num value="4000">4,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>So that it may be presumed that there is no great deal of damage to be done if some of these towns are taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>They are Newborn, <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7013676" n="1.000 28" reg="edenton, chowan, north carolina">Edenton</placeName>, <placeName reg="Elizabeth City, Pasquotank, North Carolina" key="tgn,2074494">Elizabeth City</placeName>, Murtreesborough, and <placeName key="tgn,2077311" n="1.000 11" reg="winton, hertford, north carolina">Winton</placeName>, principally engaged in the turpentine and lumber trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>There could hardly be any design simply against these towns, as the enemy could gain little by seizing them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/>If we look to the interior, we find no salient point nearer than <placeName reg="Weldon, Halifax, North Carolina" key="tgn,2077124">Weldon</placeName>, or some other locality as far from the <rs type="place">Sound</rs>, on the <orgName n="Wilmington and Weldon Railroad" type="railroad">Wilmington and Weldon Railroad</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>By seizing the <name>Railroad</name>, our communication with the <rs>South</rs> by that way may be interrupted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>But the march to that road, some <num value="60">sixty</num> or <measure n="70miles" type="distance">seventy miles</measure>, is <num value="1">one</num> of difficulty, incurring the danger of being cut off, and not therefore to be undertaken lightly or without some great end in view, which we can hardly see possible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/> If, then, there is no important field of operations in the <rs type="place">Sounds</rs> themselves or in the westward interior, we cannot see what the great Burnside Expedition can be after unless it be to threaten <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> in the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>That is a move on the chess-board that may present pleasing expectations to our Northern neighbors; but the execution of it is a very different matter from the planning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>It will be found that it is easier to take <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> in the rear on paper than by the <rs>Dismal Swampor</rs> at this season some other dismal routes of swamp, marsh, mud and forest, fit only for the marches of Amphibis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>By the canal of course they cannot come to <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>Any other line of march, if not obstructed by natural difficulties at this season, is easily defensible. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>It is now somewhat more than half a century since, a school boy in the ancient city of <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName>, I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> made the acquaintance of <persName n="Tyler,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00591" reg="nearbymention:Tyler,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Tyler</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>These qualities, the sure passport in a Government like ours to popular favor and <unclear>pu</unclear> distinction, bore him rapidly through a succession of high public employments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/>Being generally the youngest member of the body to which he belonged, and emulous of distinction, he was stimulated to the highest exertion of his powers by the living models of excellence with which he was surrounded, and his mind was thus kept in a perpetual progress of development and expansion. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/> Trained and formed under these anspices, he proved himself equal to all the various and arduous posts of public duty to which he was called by the favor and confidence of his countrymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/>In the highest of them all, he gave an honorable proof of the elevation and magnanimity of his character by bringing into the leading Executive Departments the most towering talents of the country, to aid him in the administration of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/>The selection of such men as <unclear>Web er</unclear> <persName n="Calhoun,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00607" reg="mostcommon:Calhoun,nomatch:0"><surname>Calhoun</surname></persName>, <persName n="Legare,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00608" reg="mostcommon:Legare,nomatch:0"><surname>Legare</surname></persName>, <persName n="Upshur,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00609" reg="mostcommon:Upshur,nomatch:0"><surname>Upshur</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Spencer,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00610" reg="mostcommon:Spencer,nomatch:0"><surname>Spencer</surname></persName>, proved how far he was above the operation of any unworthy sentiment of jealousy, or fear of being overshadowad in the public estimation by his official advisers; while his personal management of several of the most delicate questions of his administration &mdash; I refer more particularly to his broad and comprehensive treatment of the question of the <unclear>anexation</unclear> of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, and the firmness with which he upheld the cause of constitutional, <rs n="Republican" type="political">republican</rs> government in <placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName> against the outbreak of an unlicensed <unclear>dem</unclear>--attested the large and matured statetesmanship he had himself acquired in the schools of practical instruction in which he was bred. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>Among the qualities which most eminently and honorably distinguished him was an habitual kindliness of disposition, and a generous appreciation of others, even of those who were his political enemies and opponents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/>It was about <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> ago, in this city, on a public and memorable occasion he did himself the highest honor by a warm, spontaneous and manly tribute to the character of a great man and deceased patriot, who had stood towards him in the sititude of a powerful and declared opponent. </p>
