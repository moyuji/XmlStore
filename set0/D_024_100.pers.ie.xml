<head>The election of Governor.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/> These has been a great deal of talk about the approaching election of Governor for the old Commonwealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>As parties &mdash; for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time since the are of good feeling under <persName n="Monroe,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00197" reg="mostcommon:Monroe,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Monroe</surname></persName>--are passive, and party feeling subdued amidst the <unclear></unclear> and Turmel of war; no <unclear></unclear> undertook to make nominations, and each division of the <rs>State</rs> presented its favorite man as a fit raise of the Old Dominion in this trying varied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>In this manner the list became unusually long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>The public, so long need to the party nominees and the choosing between only <num value="2">two</num> men, was a little disturbed at the novelty of the canvass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>Sapient editors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>commented upon it. Many thought it dangerous to have so many candidates, as the choice might fall on some until person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>Some editor suggested that the contest was degenerated into a &#x0022;scribe race,&#x0022; and some other proposed (we take it for granted in just) that the editors meet and name a Governor for the people!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>Finally the anxiety on the subject seems to have extended to some of the people and even the candidate, or <num value="1">one</num> of them at least.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>That very worthy gentleman, <persName n="Hubbard,Colonel,R.,W.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00198" reg="default:Hubbard,R.,W.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Hubbard</surname></persName>, so long and favorably known as a public man, appears in a card in <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>'s <hi rend="italics"><rs n="Whig" type="political">Whig</rs>,</hi> in which he proposes that the candidates shall meet at <placeName reg="Ballard's Hotel">Ballard's Hotel</placeName>, on the <dateStruct value="-05-24"><day reg="24">24</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, for the purpose of selecting <num value="2">two</num> of their number as fit persons to be voted for at the coming election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>In this proposition the <rs>Colonel</rs> has the concurrence of the citizens of <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>Edward</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>The chief anxiety of <rs type="role">Col.</rs> H. is to avoid the election of a man by a minority vote-which he thinks will likely to the case if <num value="5">five</num> candidates run, while so large a part of the <rs>State</rs> is in the enemy's lines. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/> For ourselves we see no very good reason for alarm at the presentation of so many candidates to the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>The extension of the range of selection, if the electors be capable to choose, is all the better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>Nor do we see how the race can be called a &#x0022;scrub-race,&#x0022; The more number of competitors cannot make it a &#x0022;serub race,&#x0022; and the standing and qualifications of the rivals forbid the use of the phrase in any other sense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>We do not see that anything is likely to be gained by diminishing the number, and doubt whether a convention of the nominees can result satisfactorily even to themselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/> We had rather see all the competitors start on the track, and let the people be the judges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>What if a minority of the votes of the whole State should elect a man, it does not follow that he may not be the best man for the office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>There is good ground to reason, from many instances in modern days, that the choice of the minority would be the best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>Believing that no harm, at all events, could come of dismissing, cutting loose from concussing, for once, and leaving the people to choose for themselves, we would like to see the contest go on. It would be novel and refreshing. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head>Running the blockade.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/> The impression prevails that there is a system of collusion practised between the blockading fleet off <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston harbor</placeName> and those blockade runners who bring in <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> goods, embracing such things as give neither aid nor comfort to our army nor strengthen our means of defence in any manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>It is inferred that this system is practised because all the vessels captured by the enemy are freighted either with Government stores or things intended for the supply of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>No list of the vessels seized or destroyed by the blockaders has been published.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>Such a list would throw much light on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>It would show whether the impression generally entertained is correct or not. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/> Another alleged fact which adds strength to the suspicion of this collusion is that the vessels laden with cotton and naval stores, which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> need so much, are seldom, if ever, obstructed in their outward voyage to the <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550">West Indies</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/> If there is enough in the facts to justify this impression &mdash; if the wealth of the country is going out to benefit <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> manufacturers, and the blockade speculators are running in only useless gewgaws and goods that may be dispensed with, while the things necessary for the army are intercepted &mdash; the matter is worthy of the especial notice of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>A little investigation will easily disprove the suspicion or confirm it, and the subject is of sufficient importance to demand it. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>So the thinkers and actors lock on with folded arms; kindred is nothing, nor right virtue, nor heroism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>For once <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs> must not be meddling, warm-hearted, or over-sensitive to the wrongs or sufferings of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>We may applaud <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>, and speak encouragingly to the <name>Greeks</name>, but the <rs n="Anglo-Saxon" type="group">Anglo Saxon</rs> blood, which is unmixed in the <name>Carolinas</name> and <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, we must regard as water, and the aspirations of the <rs>Confederates</rs> as impertinent and vain.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/> After those and similar expressions of kindly feeling, the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> proceeds to controvert the proposition that it is impolite and undesirable for <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> to intervene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>It disputes the rhetorical statement of <persName n="Cobder,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00199" reg="mostcommon:Cobder,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Cobder</surname></persName>, that it would be cheaper to feed <placeName key="tgn,7008154" n="1.000 10" reg="lancashire,england,united kingdom,europe">Lancashire</placeName> on turtle and champagne than to fight for it. It shows that <placeName key="tgn,7008154" n="1.000 10" reg="lancashire,england,united kingdom,europe">Lancashire</placeName> is not the only sufferer by the present war, but that it operates injuriously on general interests, and that if the war proceeds <name>English</name> commerce may be compromised enough to occasion a financial crisis.--For our own part, whilst indifferent now to any Governmental recognition, and well content with the more practical and substantial recognition which we have just received from the money kings of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, we believe now, as we have ever believed, that the danger of a war between <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, on the ground of recognition, or even intervention, has been greatly magnified in the former country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>The conduct of the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States Government</orgName> in the <rs>Trent</rs> affair clearly showed the metal of which it is made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>It bullies and butchers only those whom it believes to be week and defenseless, and crouches like a whipped hound in the present of a powerful antagonist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>But suppose <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> had united with <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> in the proposition made by <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00200" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, or even in intervention, can any <num value="1">one</num> believe that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> would have fought those <num value="2">two</num> Empires and the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> to boot?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>Their united navies could have blockaded all her ports swept her public and private armed vessels from the face of the seat, whilst their armies could not only have kept <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName> intact, but carried fire and sword into the heart of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>As we said before, however, we are quite satisfied with the recognition we have just received from <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> in the great Confederate loan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>It is not the money only, but the proof of friendship on the part of the substantial men of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> which the loan affords; the conviction they manifestant the strength and success of our cause; the morel laid and comfort which it gives to our glorious flag.
