<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>On <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> last, however, suspicion was directed towards a workman at the place, named <persName n="Taylor,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00233" reg="default:Taylor,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Taylor</surname></persName>, and on <dateStruct><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> he was discovered in the very act of carrying them off.

In both instances according to the <hi rend="italics">Herald,</hi> he was prompted by jealousy of his own <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, and the wish to secure his own re-nomination and re-election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>The following paragraph is rich beyond expression, in mortification and chagrin: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/> &#x0022;By that act, and later ones of the same nature, he crushed a commander who had the ability to put the rebellion down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>Then we had <num value="4">four</num> commanders who had not that ability, and for whom he had no fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>Under those commanders matters got to such a desperate shait that Congress was compelled to act, and called <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00253" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Charlie,W.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> to the command of our armless in that choice the <rs>President</rs> could only acquiesce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>But the <rs>President</rs> forced upon him for the commanders of those columns men of known and proven incompetency; men who, tried many times, have failed always; men without knowledge or common sense, without genius or judgment, without anything whatever but political influence.
