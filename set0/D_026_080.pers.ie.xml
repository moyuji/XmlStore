<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> The free negroes are becoming a source of extreme vexation and trouble in the counties along the <rs>Virginia</rs> border.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>A correspondent from the <rs type="place">Lower Valley</rs>, says that when the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> come into the towns, these negroes swarm on every corner, cage to impart information, or to guide the enemy to where they will find hay, corn, &#x0026;c.--It is understood that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> share their plundering with these negroes, and this with what they steal themselves, enable them to enjoy a negro's highest estimate of freedom &mdash; idleness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>No sum can tempt them to work; the only approach to it is to go to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> posts to get supplies, carry letters, &#x0026;c, for the <rs>Union</rs> and pretended Southern people &mdash; for negroes are permitted to pass when no white man can go through the lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>A few week ago some negroes of this class were drafted by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> in <placeName reg="Clarks county">Clarks county</placeName>, and these may be expected to return in time as guides to lead the enemy to the country-houses of wealthy farmers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> Our correspondent suggests that it would be well for our men to visit that section, and bring off this portion of the population to work for our Government, instead of leaving them there to act as spies, guides and thieves. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/> We presume there are few thoughtful persons who have not reflected upon the possibility we may say the probability &mdash; of a short supply of the necessary articles of food during the present year and the next.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>Unwelcome as may be the suggestion, we may as well look at it in the face and do all in our power to avert the threatened catastrophe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>Up to <num value="183">183</num> we had for several years been favored with exuberant crops of grains, fruits, and meats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>In <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct> we had a fine corn and hay crop, a portion of which was transported to the <rs>South</rs> during the <rs type="season">autumn</rs> and <rs type="season">winter</rs> previous to the commencement of hostilities, but still leaving an immense surplus in the hands of our producers and merchants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>The crops of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct> were also unusually good, but in <dateStruct value="1863--"><year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, though the wheat crop was fair, the corn fell short, partly because the abstraction of so many farm laborers had lessened the quantity of land planted, but mainly on account of the early frosts, which destroyed large amounts of the late corn in <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706"><rs type="direction">Northern</rs> Ohio</placeName>, <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName>, <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> and other States, and damaged a still larger amount.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>Of course the scarcity of corn will prevent the production of as many hogs as usual the present year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>Many farmers tell us that the wheat is greatly damaged already, and that a full crop is not to be expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>The same report reaches us from other sections of the <rs>West</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/> During the last year large numbers of additional young men have been taken from the farms for the army, while the high wages paid for labor in the various mechanical trades and for ordinary labor in the cities, have induced others who have hitherto wholly or partially devoted their time to farming, to abandon the country and go to the large towns. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/> All these things point to but <num value="1">one</num> result, namely, comparative shortness of the most necessary articles of food for the next season, and consequent high prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>It seems to us, therefore, that farmers would not only be fulfilling a high public duty, but subserving their own individual interests, by planting as largely as possible the present spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>The country will be bare of corn by fall, and the large demand for that article, for army purposes and for home feeding, will undoubtedly cause it to bring high prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>The scarcity of breadstuffs also causes other articles of food to be more largely consumed; hence there will no doubt be a more ready sale for potatoes, cabbage, turnips, onions, &#x0026;c., than in years when bread is plenty and cheap.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>Another thing must be horne in mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>The severe winter, it believed to have killed the mass of the fruit in nearly all parts of the country, and of late years fruit has formed a large proportion of the food of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>This will now have to be supplied with other articles. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/> Under these circumstances we cannot too strongly urge upon our agricultural readers the importance to themselves and the country of raising as large crops as possible of edibles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>There will be a demand for all that can be produced, and we doubt it the supply will be equal to the demand, even at the high prices which are likely to prevail. </p> </div3>

<head>Sympathy with our Government.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/> With no part of the noble speech of <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Campbell</foreName></persName>, lately published in this paper, are we more pleased than with those glowing and affectionate sentiments of sympathy with the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, in whatever fortune betide it, which conclude his admirable address.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>Even if the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> should go down, says <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Campbell</foreName></persName>, it will still be a consolation to him, and those who think with him, to remember that they have done all in their power to assist, by their sympathy and encouragement, a worthy cause, and the great and good man who, under the most extraordinary trials and obstacles, is devoting his whole heart and soul to its successful accomplishment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/> May we not learn a lesson in our country from the manifestation of such sentiments by an illustrious foreigner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>Shall we with hold our own sympathy and encouragement from our Government &mdash; nay, labor to load it with reproach and obloquy &mdash; when the best and foremost men of other nations delight to do it honor?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>What consolation should we have, in the event of our national failure, to remember that the leaders of our own choice were hunted down by our own hands, and that by sowing broadcast the seeds of mistrust and division, we had combined with our enemies to insure our own downfall! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/> We are confronted at this moment by such an adversary as, outside the infernal pit has rarely waged war upon mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>There is no man, woman, or child in the <rs>Confederacy</rs> who has any interest in this world worth having which is not endangered by the success of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>They not only violate every recognized principle of civilized warfare, they not only desolate our farms, burn our dwellings, kill our women and children, and threaten the whole population with confiscation and extermination, but, wherever their power extends, they will not permit us to worship <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in our own temples, and would deny us not only peace on earth, but hope in Heaven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>With such a foe and at such an hour as this is it too much to expect that every Confederate citizen should strengthen the hands of the <rs>Government</rs>, should be lenient to its error of judgment, should appreciate and encourage its continual and herculean labors for the common good?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>It there is any man that has more interest in the <rs>Confederate</rs> success, more powerful incentives to energy, prudence, and fidelity, than the unanimously, chosen <rs type="role" reg="Chief Magistrate">Chief Magistrate</rs> of the <rs>Republic</rs>, if becomes that man, and no other, to impeach his motives, and strike him from behind whilst the enemy is striking him in front.--If there is a statesman conscious of the possession of greater administrative qualities than the <rs>President</rs> of the <rs>Republic</rs>, wiser in council, more patient and blooding in labor, more lion hearted in danger, let him condescend privately and personally to give the <rs>President</rs> the benefit of his superior wisdom, and to inspire his small with the under of a more fervid nature, Or, if we cannot encourage our own Government by our approbation, let us not, by abusing and denouncing it, encourage the vile foe with whom we are contending to our common destruction. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head>Cultivation of the soil.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/> The whole agricultural intelligence as well as energy of the country should be directed to the production of the means of subsistence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>All the lights that the experience of the world sheds upon the subject, all the resources that human ingenuity can furnish, all the aids that Government as well as private enterprise supply, should be tasked to the utmost for the thorough and successful cultivation of the soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>As much skill and labor should be given to the organization and efficiency of our agricultural as of our military system, and as nothing labors and earnest prayers for good harvests as for great victories. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/> From the military strength of the <rs>North</rs> we believe, with due energy and vigilant on our part, and with the continued favored of that <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> which has hitherto favored us, there is now nothing to fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>To the same benignant power, blessing the labors of the husbandman, we must look for deliverance from a greater danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>But it will no more do for us to sit with folded hands, and expect the blessing of Heaven upon our agriculture than upon our arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>In the <num value="1">one</num> case as in the other, we must do all that lies in the power of man to do; we must economize and husband our resources, we must make a wise distribution of our labor, or we can only expect the usual results of indolence and thriftlessness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>The Government may well make its own relations to the cultivation and cultivators of the soil subject of profound study and consideration. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
