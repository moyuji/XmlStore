<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> In my letter last evening, which was written hastily immediately on our arrival here, the surrender of <placeName reg="Cumberland Gap, Claiborne, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098735">Cumberland Gap</placeName> was alluded to. Since that time I have met with several of the garrison who escaped from that place &mdash; some of them after the surrender &mdash; from whom the following particulars are obtained: On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, the <dateStruct value="--7"><day reg="7">7th inst.</day></dateStruct>, the enemy made their appearance at the <rs type="place">Gap</rs>, and before <time value="1pm">one o'clock P. M.</time> of the same day our forces, amounting to about <num value="2000">2,000</num> men, surrendered unconditionally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>They were under the command of <persName n="Fraser,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Fraser,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Fraser</surname></persName>, as previously stated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>It is said that some <num value="200">200</num> of <orgName type="regiment" key="64VAInfantry"><persName n="Slemp,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Slemp,nomatch:0"><surname>Slemp</surname></persName>'s 64th Va. infantry</orgName> made their escape, refusing to surrender, together with several <num value="100">hundred</num> others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Among the batteries captured was <placeName reg="Leyden, Franklin, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2446784">Leyden</placeName>'s battery, said to be <num value="1">one</num> of the most splendid batteries in the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>It was presented to our Government by the merchants of <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>We also lost a large amount of arms, stores, equipage, &#x0026;c. The affair is regarded here as <num value="1">one</num> of the most disgraceful occurrences of the war, and the commander of the post is severely censured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>It is represented by an intelligent soldier, who made his escape after the surrender; and given as his opinion, that the enemy only had <num value="3">three</num> regiments, which were marched and counter marched in such a manner as to give the appearance of an overwhelming force, and that our commander was completely duped by this ruse; while on the other hand their forces are estimated by some as high as <num value="8000">8,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> estimate I am disposed, however, to credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>As to the probable consequences of the surrender it is hardly necessary to speak, as the advantages gained will depend greatly on the result of affairs in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> This morning we have the report that the enemy have fallen back to <placeName reg="Greenville, Greene, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099367">Greenville, Tenn.</placeName>, and that our pickets are within <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> of that place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>They will doubtless be driven back to <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName> in a few days.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> It really seems to be the most difficult matter imaginable to get reliable news from this quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>We get all sorts of rumors and reports from couriers, scouts, and the reliable gentleman, also, comes in to bear the burden of a portion of the blame for the many miraculous &#x0022;yarns&#x0022; we hear in this section as well as elsewhere in the broad limits of our Confederacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Yesterday evening I telegraphed you from <placeName reg="Bristol, Bristol, Virginia" key="tgn,2110785">Bristol</placeName> to the effect that our forces had advanced as far as within <placeName><distance reg="5miles">five miles</distance> of <placeName reg="Greenville, Greene, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099367">Greenville, Tenn.</placeName></placeName>, and that the enemy were reported evacuating <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Indeed this was the news we had at these headquarters, until about <time value="2pm">2 P. M.</time>, this day. It turns out that the enemy's pickets only fell back a short distance in front of our lines at <placeName key="tgn,2449190;tgn,1126123" n="0.081 000000.2424	placename;tgn,2449190;limestone, edgefield, south carolina,Edgefield,South Carolina,United States,North and Central America;0.020 000000.0606	placename;tgn,1126123;limestone,manitoba,canada,north and central america,Manitoba,Canada,North and Central America" reg="limestone, edgefield, south carolina,Edgefield,South Carolina,United States,North and Central America;limestone,manitoba,canada,north and central america,Manitoba,Canada,North and Central America">Limestone</placeName>, and from this fact the report originated in relation to the falling back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Yesterday morning they made another strong picket advance, and sharp skirmishing ensued in the vicinity of Limestone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Late in the afternoon of yesterday our forces fell back and the enemy occupied the ground which had been previously possessed by us. During the day we lost <measure n="2" type="killed">two killed</measure> and several wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The loss of the enemy, of course, could not be known to us. To-day at 12M. our advanced forces were still falling back in this direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>It is likely that this place will be the scene of the conflict that will decide the fate of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName> and a portion of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Southwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Of the strength of the advancing enemy we do not know much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Their cavalry force I have heard estimated as high as <num value="5000">5,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>There is some apprehension of an attempted flank movement on us from the direction of <placeName reg="Cumberland Gap, Claiborne, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098735">Cumberland Gap</placeName>, in conjunction with the front advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>This is, however, a matter of speculation, which will be developed by subsequent events.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>To make out the general situation of affairs here is no very easy job, and will require some days yet, and until that is done you will have to be satisfied with meagre and disconnected reports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>The tories all through the adjacent counties, as far as <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName>, are represented to be using all their exertions to aid their <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> brethren, and it is to be a rather dangerous experiment for a man loyal to our cause to go among them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Of our situation and defences it may not be prudent to say much, but I will state that the disposition of our forces in this vicinity is such as to inspire hope, and has allayed the fears of many citizens who were making preparations to become refugees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The militia of <placeName reg="Sullivan, Tennessee, United States" key="tgn,2001918">Sullivan county</placeName> have been at this post for <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> past, and were discharged this evening and returned to their homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>They all seem a steady and intelligent set of gentlemen, and to <persName n="King,Adjutant,John,G.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="default:King,John,G.,,"><roleName n="Adjutant">Adjutant</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>G.</foreName> <surname>King</surname></persName>, of that command, I will take occasion to return thanks for the hospitality extended to me at that place. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> Since writing this morning I have seen a Major who made his escape from <placeName reg="Cumberland Gap, Claiborne, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098735">Cumberland Gap</placeName> who furnishes a complete list of the regiments and batteries captured at that point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The artillery captured consisted of <placeName reg="Leyden, Franklin, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2446784">Leyden</placeName>'s <orgName n="GA battery">Georgia battery</orgName>, as previously reported, <orgName n="GA artillery"><persName n="Barnes,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Barnes,nomatch:0"><surname>Barnes</surname></persName>'s Georgia artillery</orgName>, and <persName n="Fains,TN battery,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Fains,nomatch:0"><roleName n="TN battery"></roleName><surname>Fains</surname></persName>'s <orgName n="TN battery">Tennessee battery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Only about <num value="250">250</num> or <num value="300">300</num> of the garrison are now thought to have escaped, a majority of whom belonged to the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA64">64th Virginia</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/><persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>, it is said, left the gap on last Friday with a brigade for <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName>, leaving only <num value="2">two</num> regiments to guard it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/> The reported fight sent you <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time> by telegraph is said to have taken place at Cotton Port, on the <placeName key="tgn,2715022" n="1.000 335" reg="tennessee river, united states, north and central america">Tennessee river</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/> After a week of tedious travel by rail from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> I have at length reached my destination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>When it is remembered that the trip by the identical route was, several months ago, accomplished in <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>, you will derive a correct idea how the iron-horse now annihilates time and space.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>It is presumed, however, that the war has compelled railroad companies, like other corporations, to the practice of economy, else with very rapid traveling our resources in this regard would soon be exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>It was suspected by a majority of the passengers, especially on the <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName> and <placeName reg="Manchester, Coffee, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100233">Manchester</placeName> road, that the slow progress and frequent and unnecessary delays were prompted by the collusion of <num value="1">one</num> of the conductors with certain railroad hotels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>It is certain that <sic>that</sic> official observed when the train left <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName> that he didn't expect to make the connection at <placeName key="tgn,2096087;tgn,2059386" n="0.136 000000.8181	placename;tgn,2096087;kingville, richland, south carolina,Richland,South Carolina,United States,North and Central America;0.136 000000.8181	placename;tgn,2059386;kingsville, johnson, missouri,Johnson,Missouri,United States,North and Central America" reg="kingville, richland, south carolina,Richland,South Carolina,United States,North and Central America;kingsville, johnson, missouri,Johnson,Missouri,United States,North and Central America">Kingsville</placeName>, although we started at schedule time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>As was expected, we arrived at the latter delectable caravansary at <time value="6oclock">6 o'clock</time> the next morning, although the train was due there at <time value="7pm">7 P. M.</time>, the previous day. The frequency of these failures has caused the traveling public to ascribe them to the reason above suggested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Seriously, it is a great annoyance to the passenger on urgent business, and especially to the hundreds of furloughed soldiers that daily crowd the trains on their way southward to snatch a brief interval of peace and quiet with loved ones at home, and who measure time by no golden standard. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/> The trip from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> was marked by little of interest to the traveler or the reading public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>At a certain important point in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709"><rs type="direction">upper</rs> North Carolina</placeName> <persName n="Ransom,General,Matt,W.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="default:Ransom,Matt,W.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <foreName>Matt</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Ransom</surname></persName>'s <orgName n="brigade">brigade</orgName> was stationed, and industrious as beavers erecting entrenchments and fortifications, in anticipation of an expected raid by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> on the coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>The same spirit seemed to prevail along the line of the railroad, and, as far as I could learn from inquiry, prevailed throughout the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>At every station the soldiers received gratifying manifestations of sympathy from the ladies, who are not behind their fair sisters of other States in exhibitions of practical patriotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/> The people of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> are now fully aroused to the critical situation of their beloved seaport city; and though some districts of the <rs>State</rs>, from want of due appreciation of the necessity, were slow at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in responding to the appeal of <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00031" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> for slaves to work on the fortifications, there is said to be no lack now of slaves to strengthen the defences of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>The general sentiment, too, is in favor of reducing it to a heap of smoking ruins in preference to surrender, and the worse than re-enactment of Beast <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00033" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>'s brutalities at New Orleans, which curse has already been announced by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> journals to be reserved as a retribution for the &#x0022;original and infernal wickedness&#x0022; of the devoted city. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/> It is possible <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> may fall, but should the enemy attempt to cross the threshold of the <rs>State</rs>, the example of <persName n="Marion,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="mostcommon:Marion,nomatch:0"><surname>Marion</surname></persName>, the &#x0022;Swamp <rs n="Fox" type="nativeamerican">Fox</rs>,&#x0022; and other partisan chiefs of the <name>Revolution</name>, is before her people.
