<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>They complain that they are hardly allowed even the privilege of escaping.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>Everywhere throughout the city they are driven about like sheep, and numbers are killed of whom no account will ever be learned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>This anomaly is explained by the fact that they have wisely looked themselves within their houses, and thus kept public attention from being attracted to them. --Some few who have ventured upon the streets, in order to procure the necessaries of life, have been stoned, but none have been killed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>The <orgName type="division" n="Ward 5">Fifth ward</orgName>, reported quiet in yesterday's paper, has since that issue been in a state of terrible excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>The prominent negro locality has been almost demolished, and upwards of <num value="200">200</num> blacks thrown homeless upon the streets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>This was in <address><street n="York street">York street</street></address>, a small thoroughfare running a block from West Broad way, near <address><street n="Canal street">Canal street</street></address>. The crowd appeared on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time> with carts, and driving the negroes into their yards commenced to remove all the furniture which seemed of value Several pianos were stolen sofas, chairs and tables were appropriated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>No police appeared; as they had nearly all been detailed for duty at the central office, a few only staying behind, in order to protect the station house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>It is estimated that several <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">thousand dollars</measure> worth of properly was thus stolen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>Of course the negroes offered no resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>They stood passively by, begging the people not to harm them, as they were helpless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>The leaders said that if they kept quiet all would be right.--<num value="1">One</num> of them, however, in attempting to escape, was severely beaten, if not killed, it being said that he was on his way to the police headquarters to get aid. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/> This was the rumor probably that led to the subsequent scenes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>About midnight several persons assembled on the corner of <address><street n="York street">York street</street></address> and West Broadway, and commenced to denounce the negroes in bitter terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>A large crowd now assembled, and it was not long before the attack commenced Bricks, stones and every convenient missile were thrown at the windows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>Several <num value="1000">thousands</num> had now gathered, and the excitement became intense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>Excited orators made speeches denouncing the draft and the negroes, and urging the people to stand firm in the defence of their rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>Only the most extreme opinions could be uttered in safety. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/> It was not long before the attack became general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>The doors of the houses were broken in, and the negroes were badly beaten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>A boy is said to have been killed by a brickbat thrown through a window.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>The blacks made no resistance, but begged for mercy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>Some of the leaders, therefore, ordered the crowd merely to sack the buildings and leave the people alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>Thereafter, it is reported, no <num value="1">one</num> was injured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>A <num value="100">hundred</num> or <num value="2">two</num> of negroes from other sections of the ward hearing of the trouble, immediately sought shelter in more congenial localities.--After the trouble a squadron of cavalry appeared, and remained during the rest of the night. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>The sergeant asked where the people were going.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>Being in citizen's clothes, and not understanding his official character, he was immediately regarded as a spy, and the women ran away in terror.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>Showing his shield, <num value="1">one</num> of the females became reassured and communicated quite freely about everything but their place of destination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>That she would not tell, and it was amusing to see the terror depicted upon the faces of those around, who feared she would.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>The negroes thought they identified some of their assailants on the opposite corner, and the sergeant, in company with <num value="2">two</num> officers, arrested them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>They could not be identified, however. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/> In <num value="1">one</num> of these buildings even the walls were torn down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>A white family, the head of which is a returned volunteer, sat in the centre of a mass of negroes, all of whom seemed utterly unable to decide on any course of action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>An aged and very intelligent negro said that he could not understand why the white people were so much incensed against them &#x0022;In fact, &#x0022; said he, &#x0022;I do not believe that they hate us much, for we have lived peaceably with them for years.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>There seems, in fact to be a sort of settled felling among the negroes that they will ever be an unfortunate race in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.--The Eastern and other boats of last evening and this morning were crowded with them, the wanderers believing that for a time they will be safe down among the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> or in the interior of this State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>This act enraged the friends of deceased, they pursued the negro, caught him in the tenement house in <num value="324">324</num> street, conveyed him to the street, and bring him to the lamp pass.--Tenements of these colored people were then fired and the building burned to the ground. </p>
