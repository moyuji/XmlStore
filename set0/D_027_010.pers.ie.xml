<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> In front of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> yesterday matters continued comparatively quiet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Nothing occurred to interrupt the prevailing monotony beyond some picket firing and the occasional boom of a heavy gun. The impression is very general that the enemy is withdrawing his troops, and, indeed, it is a pretty well ascertained fact that <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 1">one corps</orgName> of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army has already taken its departure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Coupled with this we have a report from an authentic source that a large number of transports have recently passed down the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The accounts in the <rs>Northern</rs> papers inform us that a most intense excitement prevails in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> in consequence of a &#x0022;rebel&#x0022; invasion, and it would not be at all surprising to learn that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> had peremptorily ordered <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Gen,,,:1"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, to assure his own safety on Northern soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>While this is mere speculation, there is no doubt some mysterious movement going on in <orgName n="army"><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Gen,,,:1"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, the nature of which will in a few days be revealed. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>It is probable that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are completing the destruction of the wheat crop and burning a farm-house here and there by way of gratifying their fiendish malice. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="2"> 
<head>The river obstructions.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> It is stated that the enemy, so far from removing the obstructions in the river at <placeName key="tgn,1131021" n="1.000 4" reg="trent, north carolina, united states">Trent</placeName>'s Reach, are increasing them by sinking stones and driving piles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>It may be that they apprehend the approach of a fleet of Confederate rams, and seek by this means to prevent such an occurrence. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>They were, however, too late to be of any service, for the raiders had been routed and were Hying in every direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Determined not to have their march for nothing, they halted and proceeded to fortify the place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>They went to work industriously, and in <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <measure n="16hours" type="date">sixteen hours</measure> had erected a series of most formidable breast works, which display considerable engineering skill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> at <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time> scouts brought in a report that the &#x0022;rebels were coming,&#x0022; whereupon the works were hastily abandoned, and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were soon in full retreat to the main body of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Grant,Gen,,,:1"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Persons who have examined these works say that it is almost incredible that so much labor could have been performed in so short a space of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Had they delayed their departure for a few hours, it is quite likely that they would have been caught in a trap, escape from which would have been an impossibility. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/> The quadrilateral editor of the <orgName n="New York Times" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> is certainly the most untiring campaigner (upon paper) that ever existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>No sooner has <num value="1">one</num> system of operations, mapped out for certain success, been brought to ruin by the stupid Confederates who refuse to be conquered by paper campaigns, than we find him busy spinning another.&#x0022;The spider of <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00206" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName>'s famous simile, throned on the centre of a <num value="1000">thousand</num> converging lines, is the proper emblem of his indefatigable activity, as it is, likewise, of his poisonous rancor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>But a month ago <persName n="Hunter,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00207" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><surname>Hunter</surname></persName> was to come from the <rs>West</rs>, take <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName>, and cut us off in that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>Butter was to come from the <rs>East</rs> and take <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>Thus we were to be cut off from the <rs>South</rs>.

In a word, the quadrilateral's <num value="145" type="ordinal">one hundred and forty-fifth</num> scheme for subduing the rebels has proved a glorious failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>The web which was to encircle the &#x0022;devoted city&#x0022; has been brushed away, without leaving a trace behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>They were, we presume, merely set on foot to gratify the instinctive proclivity to theft, which is characteristic of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> race. &#x0022;Military significance.&#x0022; Oh, yes!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>They thought he had been knocked overboard in the action and drowned.
