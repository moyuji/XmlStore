<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> From a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> correspondence, dated New Orleans, <date value="05-23">23d May,</date> and published in the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName> of <date value="06-03">June 3d,</date> we extract the following paragraph, which shows that the attack on <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName> was made by all the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> forces that could be spared from <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256"><rs type="direction">lower</rs> Louisiana</placeName>: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> Since my last all the available force in this department has been concentrated near <placeName key="tgn,7017543" n="1.000 293" reg="baton rouge, baton rouge, louisiana">Baton Rouge</placeName>, in order to assist in the grand attack upon <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The main body of the army is to-day doubtless between Bayon Sara and the enemy's works, while the <orgName>divisions of <persName n="Augur,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:Augur,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Generals</roleName> <surname>Augur</surname></persName></orgName> and <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> are operating to the south and cost of the great rebel stronghold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>I have no doubt in my own mind that before this letter is laid before the <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Herold,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Herold,nomatch:0"><surname>Herold</surname></persName>'s</hi> readers <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName> will be occupied by our forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Our attack will be admirably arranged, and the force brought to bear will be fully adequate to make it in all respects successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The <rs>Generals</rs> commanding are all experienced men and soldiers, and they will so push matters that defeat will be impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>As you may suppose, we are all anxious to hear the result and other matters are for a time forgotten. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> The &#x0022;grand attack&#x0022; thus foreshadowed with the usual flourish of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> trumpets has been made; the defeat, so confidently declared to be &#x0022;impossible,&#x0022; is acknowledged by the very same individual in his letter of the <num value="29" type="ordinal">29th</num>, and the &#x0022;entire available force&#x0022; which, by his own admission, had been concentrated around <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName>, is now in all probability so cut up and demoralized that it will hardly be able to resume the offensive for some time to come. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> We are strongly inclined to doubt the reported occupation of <placeName reg="Milliken's Bend, Madison, Louisiana" key="tgn,2515323">Milliken's Bend</placeName> by <persName n="Smith,,Kirby,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="default:Smith,Kirby,,,"><foreName>Kirby</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>, and still think that his forces must be somewhere in the vicinity of <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName> though on the opposite bank of the river.--Should they find the means of crossing over at some point between <placeName key="tgn,7017543" n="1.000 293" reg="baton rouge, baton rouge, louisiana">Baton Rouge</placeName> and <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName>, the condition of <persName n="Banks,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Banks,nomatch:0"><surname>Banks</surname></persName> must become highly critical, as he would be liable to a Bank attack, and might be cut off from his base of operations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> Among the many conflicting reports sent to us from <placeName reg="Jackson, East Feliciana, Louisiana" key="tgn,2043079">Jackson</placeName>, there was <num value="1">one</num> announcing a decisive victory gained by <persName n="Smith,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Smith,Kirby,,,"><surname>Smith</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName>, and we still look upon that news as more likely to prove true than that of the occupation of <placeName reg="Milliken's Bend, Madison, Louisiana" key="tgn,2515323">Milliken's Bend</placeName> by the same General.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Should the latter, however, turn out to be the correct version of <persName n="Smith,,Kirby,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="default:Smith,Kirby,,,"><foreName>Kirby</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>'s movements it would show that no apprehension is felt as to the ability of our forces to maintain their position at <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>At all events, the failure of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> and <persName n="Banks,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Banks,nomatch:0"><surname>Banks</surname></persName> in their respective operations is now placed beyond all reasonable doubt, and as they were both parts of the same plan, and were doubtless intended to co-operate to the same ends, the whole <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> campaign may be considered as a complete failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/><persName n="Johnson,General,Joe,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="default:Johnson,Joe,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Joe</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName> has now, or ought to have, the game into his own hands, and we trust that he will not be slow to avail himself of the brilliant opportunity thus given him to achieve something more than a barren triumph in the <rs>Southwest</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>We have had so many glorious victories leading to no appreciable results, that a battle followed by substantial benefits to our cause would be hailed by the whole country as the inauguration of a new era in the conduct of this war. </p> </q><bibl n="Yankee correspondence"></bibl></cit> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>But in order to stimulate the efforts now being made in that direction, our Government should lose no time in proclaiming its intentions as regards the participants in such raids, whenever caught by our troops or the volunteer organizations now springing up everywhere for home defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Nothing can be clearer than that these outlaws in uniform should not be dealt with as soldiers or belligerents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>To treat them, when captured, as ordinary prisoners, would be but to invite a repetition of similar outrages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>As robbers, incendiaries, and murderers they come into our country, and as such they must be shot down, strung up, or set to work in our penitentiaries, like other thieves and assassins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>If we fail to do so, we shall incur the contempt and ridicule of the whole world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>It will be equivalent to a standing invitation to all the thieves in Yankeedom to come and set fire to our houses, plunder our cities and villages, carry off our negroes, and commit nameless outrages on our defenceless population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Whenever confronted by an armed force they would be only too glad to surrender as prisoners, with the prospect of returning to their hellish work after being exchanged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Thus the <num value="2">two</num> darling objects of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> in this war &mdash; to rob the unprotected, and to keep out of the reach of Confederate powder &mdash; would be fully secured, and the whole population of the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> States, including their blasphemous preachers and strong minded women of <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> proclivities would embrace with enthusiasm this newest and most promising of all <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> &#x0022;specs.&#x0022; With proper preparations to receive them, every gang of mounted highwaymen that ventures upon Southern ground, can be bagged, their horses and weapons taken from them, and their carcases turned over to the jailor or the hangman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The immediate result of such a mode of dealing with the marauders, if not merely announced by our Government, but actually carried out in every case, would be to throw the wettest of all imaginable blankets on the now prevailing <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> phrenzy for &#x0022;cavalry raids,&#x0022; whilst it would stimulate to the utmost every man engaged in the exciting sport of hunting the <name>Jayhawkers</name>. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> It is to be regretted that the reading public is so much dependent for detailed accounts of battles in the <rs>South</rs> upon Northern journals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>These accounts are often transferred bodily to the <rs>Southern</rs> press, and although we know them to be the most shameless liars in the world, their fables, when unaccompanied by note or comment, are apt to have some effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>It is difficult to conceive that men can lie so persistently and ingeniously, although we have had a <num value="1000">thousand</num> demonstrations of the fact Some system should be established by which we can obtain from Southern sources prompt and intelligent accounts of military operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>This remark applies more particularly to the <rs>Southwest</rs>, events in our own neighborhood being in general made known with sufficient punctuality and detail by our own friends.--But the <rs n="Fall of Vicksburg" type="battle">siege of Vicksburg</rs>, for example, seems given over to the hands of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> historians, whose own reluctated admissions were the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> channels through which we have suffered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>They are anxious to conceal as far as possible the extent of their loss, and we are as anxious to know it, not from vague and contradictory telegraphs from <placeName reg="South River, Georgia, United States" key="tgn,2681709">South</placeName> western operators, but in a detailed and agent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The reports of the late fight in <placeName reg="Culpeper, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002155">Culpeper county</placeName>, brought down by passengers on the <rs>Central</rs> train yesterday evening, are hardly more satisfactory than those which had previously reached us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>It is equally certain that the battle terminated with the repulse of the enemy and the advantage on our side, the enemy's loss in killed and wounded, and in the number of prisoners captured, being considerably greater than that sustained by our forces. </p>
