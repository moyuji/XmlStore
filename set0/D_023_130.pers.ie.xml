<head>The <name>French</name> proposition of mediation.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/> The reply of <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName> to the <rs>French</rs> proposition of mediation confirms what we have often taken occasion to remark, that the present Government of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> is the most deadly enemy we have in all <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>It is believed that this is not the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time the <rs>Emperor</rs> of the <rs>French</rs> has proposed a joint mediation to the ministry of <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Palmerston</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>A similar proposition was made last winter, when <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName> met it by the promise of <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00184" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> to conquer the <rs>South</rs>, and send a plenty of cotton in <measure n="60days" type="date">sixty days</measure>. As the cotton to be sent was to be <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> taken by violence, and without payment, from the <rs>Southern</rs> planters, the proposal amounted to a gratuitous and glaring insult, since it placed <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> in the attitude of a receiver of stolen goods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>But <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName> had neither the brains nor the heart to receive it as such, but actually presented it to the <rs>French Emperor</rs> as reason for not offering mediation at that time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/> Some of our contemporaries appear to think that this rejection of the <rs>Emperor</rs>'s proposal will lead to the overthrow of the <rs>Palmerston Ministry</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>We do not coincide in this opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>We have seen very few indications of any desire on the part of the <rs>British</rs> people to change the relations now existing between that country and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>Indeed, they are <unclear></unclear> ignorant of the true character of the war in which we are engaged, and so far from recognizing it as a struggle between <num value="2">two</num> powerful nations, they evidently regard it as nothing more than a rebellion on our side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>This is proved by the speech of <persName n="Gladstone,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00185" reg="mostcommon:Gladstone,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gladstone</surname></persName>, who told his hearers that <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00186" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Joseph,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> had <q>&#x0022;made a nation.&#x0022;</q> evidently not understanding the nature of the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the old <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and not perceiving that every <num value="1">one</num> of the <name>States</name> united by it was an independent nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>As a rebellion, then, the <rs>English</rs> people regard it, and towards us as rebels they have shown some sympathy, and not a little admiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>But they have contented themselves with patting us on the back, as they might do a favorite dog, and have not shown the slightest disposition to part us. It has been sport for them, and they would by all means see it fought out. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/> The <rs>French Emperor</rs> would gladly put an end to the war, but he is bound to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> by engagements which it would be inconvenient to break through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>He neither will, nor can consistently with policy, interfere without her, and her consent he will never get. It is for the interest of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> that we should cut each other's threats, until not a man be left on either side, if such a consummation were possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>Such, at least, <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName> thinks is her interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>That he is a man of the smallest possible calibre, we think no man who has ever read his compilation of the <rs>Holland</rs> papers, and his life of <persName n="Moore,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00187" reg="mostcommon:Moore,nomatch:0"><surname>Moore</surname></persName>, will be disposed to deny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>If it be objected that the <rs>Duke</rs> of <persName n="Wellington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00188" reg="mostcommon:Wellington,nomatch:0"><surname>Wellington</surname></persName> once said <q>&#x0022;<persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName></persName> (<persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00189" reg="mostcommon:Russell,nomatch:0"><surname>Russell</surname></persName>) is a heat in himself,&#x0022;</q> It must be remembered that he said nearly the same thing of <persName n="Lowe,Sir,Hudson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00190" reg="default:Lowe,Hudson,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Hudson</foreName> <surname>Lowe</surname></persName>, and that he praised <persName n="Talleyrand,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00191" reg="mostcommon:Talleyrand,nomatch:0"><surname>Talleyrand</surname></persName> as <num value="1">one</num> of the most upright men in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>Whatever may be the disposition of the <rs>French Emperor</rs>, he will never act without the concurrence of the <rs>English Government</rs>, and that he will never get while <persName n="Palmerston,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00192" reg="mostcommon:Palmerston,nomatch:0"><surname>Palmerston</surname></persName> is <hi rend="italics">Premier,</hi> and <persName n="Secretary,Lord,Russell,Foreign,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00193" reg="default:Secretary,Russell,Foreign,,"><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName> <foreName>Foreign</foreName> <surname>Secretary</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/> The reply of <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName> is characteristic enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>He fears that a proposition like that indicated by <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> might not be relished at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>There it is. He is afraid of offending <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00194" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00195" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>This is the bugbear that has haunted him throughout the war. It is manifest that he stands in mortal terror of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and the debates in Parliament last session showed that he was not alone in his fears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>Other members expressed direful apprehensions about <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>, and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> taking the hint, are open-mouthed in expressing their determination to seize it, as soon as they shall have <q>&#x0022;crushed cut the present unnatural rebellion.&#x0022;</q> It is a pity such a nation as that of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> cannot find somebody better than <num value="2">two</num> old septuagenarians to put at the head of their Government. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/> Let our people be satisfied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>They are not going to be recognized by any <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> Government until they establish their own independence by hard fighting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>If any such Government be so disposed, <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> will prevent it if she possibly can. That Government is hand and glove with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00196" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> is as powerful at <placeName key="tgn,2060347" n="1.000 2" reg="saint james, phelps, missouri">St. James</placeName> as he is in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>As for <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> itself, it is far more probable that she will join the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> in oppressing us than that she will recognize our independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>She is in the hands of small men, and these small men are in the last extremity of old age &mdash; drivellers and dotards &mdash; from whom it is vain to expect a liberal or manly policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>Interest, fear, and senility are all against us. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
