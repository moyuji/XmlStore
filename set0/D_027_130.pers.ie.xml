<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>She was ordered to land at once; her pilot replied he would at the lower landing; as she made every disposition to come in, our batteries ceased firing, as we were desirous to obtain her uninjured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>When in range of our <orgName n="Lower Battery" type="battery">lower batteries</orgName>, we opened fire on her; but seeing it was impossible to pass the battery, disabled as she was, she got into a bend of the river, beyond range, and landed on the far side of the river to repair, intending, no doubt, to slip down the river under cover of the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>She shelled the woods continually, to deceive us in regard to her condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>As we had other batteries coming, I am very credibly informed that <persName n="Buford,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00145" reg="mostcommon:Buford,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Buford</surname></persName> immediately dispatched a courier, stating the condition of affairs, and directing that <num value="1">one</num> be sent down the river to the bend to force the gunboat either to drop down or surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>It was accomplished with little difficulty; and <persName><foreName>Ferdinand</foreName></persName> had no sooner been restored than he appealed to the <name>Allies</name> in assisting him to subdue his rebellious South <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> and <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> subjects, who had proved too strong for his own power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>A meeting was to have taken place in <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> during the ensuing winter for the purpose of arranging preliminaries, when <persName n="Canning,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00194" reg="mostcommon:Canning,nomatch:0"><surname>Canning</surname></persName>, at that time foreign secretary, blew up the whole scheme by telling the <rs>French</rs> minister that, if the <name>Allies</name> proceeded, <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> would instantly recognize the independence of the <rs>Spanish</rs> colonies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>When our Congress met, <persName n="Monroe,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00195" reg="mostcommon:Monroe,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Monroe</surname></persName>, in his annual message, called the attention of that body to the subject, and declared that while we never had interfered, and never would interfere, with the established colonies of <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> powers on this continent, the attempt of those powers to introduce their peculiar maxims of government, and to impose them upon the <rs>South</rs> <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> States, could not be viewed by us as a friendly act. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/> Such were the circumstances under which <persName n="Monroe,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00196" reg="mostcommon:Monroe,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Monroe</surname></persName> put forth this famous declaration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>It was made at a particular crisis, and designed for a special application.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>It was never meant to have that large and general application to this whole continent which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> land-stealers and the <name>Manifest</name>-Destiny men afterwards gave it. The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, of course, have the greatest possible interest in giving it this interpretation, and in maintaining it to the uttermost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>But we again assert that our interest is directly the contrary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> themselves have established the most infernal of all despotisms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>When <persName n="Monroe,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00198" reg="mostcommon:Monroe,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Monroe</surname></persName> made his declaration, we were an united people; now we are divided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>It is to our interest to have a powerful <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> government in <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> for a neighbor; because, if we do not, we shall have <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> for our neighbors on the south as well as on the north; and it is impossible that any neighbors can be so bad as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>It is far better for us to have them hemmed in on all sides; and therefore we say again we have not as much interest as they in maintaining their interpretation of the <rs>Monroe Doctrine</rs>. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/>
