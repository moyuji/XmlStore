<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The cause he sums up as follows: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> The sources of our present troubles, and the causes of the present wide-spread dissatisfaction in the <rs>South</rs>, may be traced, in the first place, to certain unconstitutional and most reprehensible expedients, adopted in some of the non-slaveholding States, to abstract and virtually nullify the fugitive slave inn. Secondly, to what seems to be the present purpose of a party now in the ascendancy in those States, to refuse the further extension of slavery into the <rs>Territories</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; thus denying to the people of the <rs>North</rs> an equality of right in the common property of the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>And, lastly, but perhaps more than all, may be attributed to that tired and fanatical spirit of hostility towards the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>, which now pervades more or less generally, all the non-slaveholding States, frequently manifesting itself in language and conduct wholly in conceal with the courtesy due between neighboring Commonwealths, to say nothing of the men delicate relations and obvious duties of other States. </p> </q><bibl n="Geo. W. Summers"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> Resolution is not justified, in his opinion, by the election of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, and such a step should be the last remedy sought by a border State.--It is a step which should be taken by none, but by it last of all. All its interests are against it, and none of its wrongs would be remedied by it. He recommends that the border States, slave and free, appoint Commissioners, to meet at <placeName reg="Frankfort, Franklin, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013939">Frankfort</placeName> or <placeName reg="Lexington, Fayette, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013887">Lexington, Ky.</placeName>, who shall devise some proposition of compromise, which shall be submitted by Congress to the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>In conclusion, he says: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> I take it for granted that the <rs>Convention</rs>, if called, will be elected and organized upon the basis of the qualified voters of the white population of the <rs>State</rs>, being the basis of the present <orgName n="House of Delegates" type="government">House of Delegates</orgName>, as arranged by the existing Constitution of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>I am free to say that I could never consent to any more restricted basis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>It will not be a question of contribution, but a question of Union or Disunion, that will occupy the attention of the proposed Convention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>In this issue every men in the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> has an equal interest, and an equal right to be represented and heard. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> I do not propose to inquire whether the right of State secession is a right resulting from the nature of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, and from the terms and manner in which the <name>States</name> became parties thereto, to be exercised by the seceding States, without a co-relative right on the part of the <rs>General Government</rs> to prevent the withdrawal; or, whether it be a revolutionary right, subjecting the seceding State to the restraining power of the <rs>General Government</rs>, and the hazard of conquest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>I am of opinion that the <rs>Union</rs> of these States cannot be advantageously preserved by force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>If it is to be maintained by standing armies and blockading squadrons, it will not be worth maintaining.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>When <num value="1">one</num> or more States decide for themselves, either that the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> has become an oppression to which they can no longer submit, or that a further connection with other States has become injurious, or dishonorable, and withdraw from the <rs>Union</rs>, it is better to leave them to the teachings of the experiment and to the hope of reconciliation, than by the employment of force, involve the country in civil war. The inability of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> to compel an unwilling State to elect and send members to the two Houses of Congress, or to perform the duties of a State within the <rs>Union</rs>: the want of power to force citizens to accept and discharge the duties of Federal offices and appointments within the <rs>State</rs>, and the inexpediency and unconstitutionality of making war upon the <name>States</name>, as such, or holding subjugated States as appendages to the <rs>Government</rs>, present insuperable objections to the employment of coercive means of retention. </p></q> </cit> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/> Since the passage of the <name>Bill</name> providing for the call of a <orgName n="People of Virginia's Convention" type="convention">Convention of the people of Virginia</orgName>, I have been approached by many of you with the inquiry whether I would consent to serve in that body as the delegate from this county; and only yesterday a communication to the same effect, asking an expression of my views upon the questions which will engage its deliberations, appeared in the public prints, emanating, as I am informed from sources entitled to my most respectful consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>It is proper that I should reply at once to these inquiries. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/> The great responsibility attached to the place of delegable to a Convention, the most important probably, which has over assembler in the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>, charged, as it will be, with the decision of questions involving the very existence of the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName> and the honor and safety of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, precludes the idea of my <hi rend="italics">seeking</hi> an election to such a position; and I feel that those who know me well, will credit the security of the declaration that if I consulted my own wishes I should at once decline its acceptance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>But there are great occasions in the history of every people in which it becomes the imperative duty of every citizen to render his services in whatever capacity his country may call for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>Recognizing this as eminently such an occasion, I do not feel at liberty to shrink from the performance of any duty which may be assigned to me by the people of my native county to whose kindness I owe so much in the past, and with whose future fortunes all that I cherish of possess is indissolubly bound up. If, therefore, it should be your wish that I should serve you in the honorable position in question, I shall, obey your call and bring to the discharge of its duties whatever of ability or fidelity I may possess, </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/> It seems to be agreed on all hands that the unhappy controversy which has so long distracted our country, and now threatens its total dismemberment must in some way be now brought to a close.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>Yielding to no citizen within its broad limits in sincerity of devotion to the <orgName n="Great Union" type="union">great Union</orgName> established by our Fathers, every sentiment of my heart impels me to desire its preservation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>And I should deem it a sacred duty, in whatever position I might occupy, to embrace and sustain any adjustment of the questions in dispute, between the <rs>Northern</rs> and the <rs>Southern States</rs>, which may be permanent and honorable, so as to perpetuate the <rs>Union</rs> upon the principles upon which it was formed.--To render such an adjustment satisfactory to the <rs>South</rs>, it should, in my judgment, be radical in its character, and be sanctioned by constitutional provisions, which shall forever deprive the <orgName n="National Congress" type="congress">National Congress</orgName> of the power to legislate at all in reference to slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>The <orgName n="Virginia Legislature" type="legislature">Legislature of Virginia</orgName> has with great unanimity originated a measure inviting an assembly of Commissioners from the different States, with the view of ascertaining whether any such settlement can be made and I think we shall now be able to see whether the people of the <rs>Northern States</rs> intend to make proper concessions to our just demands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>If they send no Commissioners, or those sent should fail to agree upon any basis of settlement, the <rs>Convention</rs> will be able to decide, in the light of those facts, upon the course proper for <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to pursue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>If, on the contrary, any plan of adjustment can be devised, either by them or in any other mode, with fair and reasonable prospects of successful adoption by which the rights and interests of the <rs>South</rs> can be effectually guaranteed and protected against future encroachment, no <num value="1">one</num> would welcome such a result with more satisfaction than myself.--But in view of the developments which are occurring every day in reference to the state of public sentiment at the <rs>North</rs>, we are constrained to contemplate the failure of any such adjustment as an event probable to occur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>In such case; the duty of the <rs>Convention</rs> would seem to be plain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>If we cannot have peace and security in the <rs>Union</rs>, we must seek them out of it. <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> cannot postpone the exercise of this right for an indefinite time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>The Convention cannot finally adjourn, with safety or honor, until this question, shall in some way be settled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>To fail utterly to secure the rights of the <rs>South</rs>, and then to adjourn without day and without action for our own preservation, would not only cover the <rs>State</rs> with disgrace, but would be a direct invitation to further aggression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>It would do more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/><num value="5">Five</num> States have already left the <rs>Union</rs>, and there is every reason to believe that others will follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/><placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, through her Legislature, has determined that coercion against a seceding State will be regarded as an attack upon herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>If the border States consent to remain in the <rs>Union</rs>, without such an adjustment as will eventually secure the return of the seceding States, it cannot be doubted that coercion will be resorted to against the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>It has been scarcely restrained, thus far under the administration of <persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00416" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>Will it not in such a case, be at once resorted to under that of <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00417" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>In such a conflict, unless <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> was false to her own pledges and to every Southern imminent, she must aid the seceding States; and a bloody civil war, from which she had vainly endeavored to escape, by the surrender of her rights for the sake of remaining in the <rs>Union</rs>, would inevitably be entailed upon the country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/> Such are my views upon this momentous question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>How far events may modify them, it is impossible now to foresee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>But they are expressed to you as I entertain them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>If you should think proper to call me to the great trust which some of you desire me to fill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>I shall endeavor so to guide my course as to preserve and restore the <rs>Union</rs>, if possible; but, at all hazards, to protect and defend <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>. </p>

<head>My coming out.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/> It was upon the <date value="11-18">18th of November</date> last that we received <hi rend="italics">the</hi> invitation--<rs type="role">Mr.</rs> and Mrs., and <persName n="Smythe,Miss,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00627" reg="mostcommon:Smythe,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Smythe</surname></persName> to dinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>I secreted the note to read alone when unseen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>There was a demur about my going &mdash; how my heart sank; but it was decided before papa went out to see his patients that we should go. It was all <persName n="Smythe,Miss,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00628" reg="mostcommon:Smythe,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Smythe</surname></persName> to me. I had a new dress bought, as white as blanc mange; my old ones were only fit for <q>&#x0022;break-ups&#x0022;</q> at school, mamma would have treated my going us an indifferent matter, and no more than if it were baby coming into desert, whereas it was my coming out, my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> grown-up party &mdash; no. I was determined to have a new dress, and I got it. I dreamed about it every night; such curious dreams.--There was <num value="1">one</num> very handsome officer, with a sword, and a black moustache, who appeared to me <num value="3">three</num> times, followed me all over the room, and would hold the pedal down for me with his foot, when I played.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>I do play.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>I began to believe in him the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>-time, and imparted the secret to my dearest friend, to whom I tell everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>The day came at last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>I had a dreadful sore throat, but of course I did not tell anybody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>I really had not patience to see papa making baby <q>&#x0022;ride-a-cock-horse,&#x0022;</q> (I should like to ask <persName n="Darwin,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00629" reg="mostcommon:Darwin,nomatch:0"><surname>Darwin</surname></persName> what is a cock-horse) as if nothing were going to happen.--He little knew how soon he might be called upon to part with me to some <num value="1">one</num> else, but then he had not dreamed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>I could not help agreeing with <persName><foreName>Ann</foreName></persName>, who said:<cit><q rend="inline">&#x0022;How well you do look, miss, to be sure.&#x0022; And I did look well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>My hair, a rich brown, from pomatum, in ringlets that looked as if nothing would bring them out, quite floated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>But I must leave my appearance to your imagination; only, if I were somebody else who had to describe me that evening, I could do it well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>My dress fortunately arrived in time; my <rs n="kid gloves" type="product">kid gloves</rs> did not slit, when the brougham was at the door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>Nobody was taken suddenly ill, and wanted papa &mdash; as generally happens when he is going anywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>So far everything prospered my coming out. All the way there I thought over <hi rend="italics">Rules to be observed when in Company &mdash; a Companion for the Dinner-table,</hi> a book we used at <persName n="Coldstream,Miss,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00630" reg="mostcommon:Coldstream,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Coldstream</surname></persName>'s, where I was at school, and where we had to carry them into practice, at a large table, with very little upon it. How well I remember upsetting a potato, and being made an example of Some of the rules at table were what every <num value="1">one</num> knows, but it was the phraseology <rs>Miss Coldstream</rs> said was so refined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/><num value="1">One</num> was: &#x0022;Never attempt to hold converse with your vision, white your bucolic is <foreign lang="fre">rempli de viandes</foreign>;&#x0022; and <num value="1">one</num>; &#x0022;Give a casual glance at your vision, to observe of he is going to converse, before raising the viands to your lips.--It is better to manger en accord.&#x0022; When we entered the drawing-room, they were in the twilight, and as the room was large, I could not see well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>The lady of the house, who is very deaf, came and talked to me; but, as she heard everything wrong that I observed, it was uninteresting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>She likewise brought the children, which I thought tiresome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/>We have <num value="2">two</num> babies at home, twins, who are always wanted to be held, or played with, so I have enough of them: but they soon cried, and departed.--Left to myself, my eyes wandered round the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>I heard papa's laugh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>In <hi rend="italics">Rules to be Observed,</hi> it says: &#x0022;Never laugh, only smile;&#x0022; however, I suppose poor papa's education was completed before it came out. I ought to be thankful for my advantages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>There appeared to be not a large number of people, but &mdash; yes!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>not fur from me there was the gentleman with the black moustache, talking to a young lady in pink by the firelight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>It must be the officer, devoid of the sword.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>Who does not believe in dreams?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>I do. I wished candles would come, that I might see him better, and that he might see me. I wondered how soon we should become intimate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/></q><bibl></bibl></cit> </p> 
<p> All at once, I was struck dumb by seeing a small figure in black standing by itself near a window.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>Suppose it should be a boy!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>It might be a man; some men were short, very short in stature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>It might be a very young man. But a boy!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>I trembled; and why?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>some <num value="1">one</num> may ask. Because, if it were a boy, I had a creeping presentiment he would <q>&#x0022;take me in, &#x0022;</q> (remember, it was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time I ever had been <q>&#x0022;taken in.&#x0022;</q>) There was the boy by itself; here was I by myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>I turned away my eyes to the gentleman with the black moustache; but no!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>it would not do, while that undecided figure was in the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>There is a step; lamps are coming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>Now for it!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>O yes!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>it is a boy, and a boy in jackets!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>downright jackets!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>not even those half-and-half species of garment, descending to the beginning of the leg. The gentleman with the black moustache never looks at me, even when it is light; no, it is still the lady on the ottoman; but dreams cannot be wrong <num value="3">three</num> times, so my lady on the ottoman had better make the most of the present!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>Another step!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>a clanking, a fleshy odor!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>A very stout gentleman, who has been sitting opposite to me, looks up animatedly towards the door, rubs his hands, and smiles at me. I did not know whether to return his smile, as I had not been introduced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>A very thin gentleman, who has been talking on prophecy to a lady with a blue nose, near me, sighs and looks dejected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>I heard him ask for a &#x0022; <hi rend="italics">very</hi> little, if you please,&#x0022; at dinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/>The gentleman with the black moustache glances anxiously at the hostess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>The gentleman with the black moustache is requested to hook the lady with the blue nose; the lady in pink is bestowed upon a gentleman with yellow whiskers; the very thin and the very stout gentlemen are disposed of. O horror!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>the boy is being brought my way. &#x0022;<persName><foreName>Gustavus</foreName></persName>, my dear, give your arm to <persName n="Smythe,Miss,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00631" reg="mostcommon:Smythe,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Smythe</surname></persName>. &#x0022; I could have cried &mdash; after all my dreams, after all my anticipations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>However, there was no help for it but to take the little wretch's arm, and follow all the others down stairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/>I had the most uncomfortable place at table (where it is all leg, and no more room allowed,) except the boy's. The door opened right upon him, but he looked unabashed by anything, and kept saying to the waiters, when the door came harder than usual. &#x0022;I say, draw it mild, old fellow! &#x0022; What was more annoying to me, was that I had the black moustache full in view, and papa nearly opposite; and the boy, who had not the lowest of voices, thought himself bound to talk: <q>&#x0022;<num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> party, eh?&#x0022;</q> Thought so; mine, too. (His, indeed!) Did not want me to come in; told 'em I'd be off to sea. The Governor said you were coming, so mother dried her eyes, and it was all right. &#x0022;You see,&#x0022; he continued, confidentially, &#x0022;things get so cold when they are brought out; besides, I want to bag a lot for some other fellows.&#x0022; How I wished dinner was over, and I think the gentleman with the black moustache wished so, too. &#x0022;I say,&#x0022; continued the boy, &#x0022;that dish there is so jolly, have a little before that old fellow with the red face gets it all &mdash; he knows what's nice.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/> What a mortifying dinner!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>The single consolation was, that the boy informed me he did not care for drawing-rooms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>Nobody else spoke to me; the boy was considered a sufficient companion!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>Why, O why were feelings invented?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>Once, in a pause, papa, who was talking to the mild hostess through a speaking trumpet, and at whom <persName><foreName>Gustavus</foreName></persName> had-grumbled for sending him a chicken-leg (he hated legs!) said:<q>&#x0022;I see my young friend and <persName><foreName>Henrietta</foreName></persName> are getting on very-well together; it is my little girl's <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> party.&#x0022;</q> I thought I had never heard papa's voice so loud, and through a trumpet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>The lady replied in a mild voice, and smiling benevolently at us: &#x0022;Yes, Gussy is a very nice boy;&#x0022; and then leaning over him &#x0022;<persName><foreName>Gustavus</foreName></persName>, dear, don't take too much wine,&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/> After papa's speech, all was a blank to me. I have a vision of <persName><foreName>Gustavus</foreName></persName> taking too much wine, and growing noisy; then of a hasty signal to depart, from his mamma, and of my dress being torn by his chair; then of us ladies clustering round the fire (I on the outside, of course,) and of the lady of the <unclear>an</unclear> looking at herself in the mirror, <hi rend="italics">very </hi> near, then retiring to a distant window, <q>&#x0022;to look at the moon, &#x0022;</q> she said I should perhaps have rejoiced when I heard it whispered that lovers were a great bore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>I was attracted by that lady; she seemed something superior to me, and I felt very small beside her. Presently there was a buzz as of bees, and the gentlemen entered (not the boy,) and my courage rose a little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>I made a rush at a seat, which chanced to be by the lady who admired the moon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>The gentleman with the black moustache sauntered up. Could it be to me at last?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>He certainly looked at me, but not with a glance of pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/><q>&#x0022;How sweet the moon is!&#x0022;</q> murmured the lady.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/><q>&#x0022;Sweets to the sweet!&#x0022;</q> murmured the gentleman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/>The lady smiled, and she, too, looked at me. <q>&#x0022;Let us play at chess, &#x0022;</q> said the lady, and accordingly (very stupid of me, I begin to think now,) I sat and watched them arrange the pieces, which took a long time to come out of the box. While the lady's fingers were daintily holding a bishop head, the gentleman would say, very low: <q>&#x0022;Then you <hi rend="italics">do</hi> like me the best, <persName n="Arabella,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00633" reg="mostcommon:Arabella,nomatch:0"><surname>Arabella</surname></persName>?&#x0022;</q> probably referring to Yellow Whiskers, The bishop made a few faltering steps, such as bishop ought not to take, and settled beside black moustache's queen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/><q>&#x0022;Do you play?&#x0022;</q> says <persName n="Arabella,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00637" reg="mostcommon:Arabella,nomatch:0"><surname>Arabella</surname></persName>, turning to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/><q>&#x0022;Yes I reply through a very sore throat and with a very husky voice, &#x0022;</q> from long affluence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/><q>&#x0022;Then do favor us,&#x0022;</q>says the mouth under the moustache is little bit of <num value="1">one</num> of my dreams coming true &mdash; but he only said it to get rid of me. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/> I accordingly <hi rend="italics">did</hi> play, because I did not like to refuse, a brilliant piece of <num value="20">twenty</num> pages, to which every <num value="1">one</num> said a mechanical <q>&#x0022;Thank you&#x0022;</q> <hi rend="italics">en masse,</hi> and the gentleman with the red <unclear></unclear> (who woke up at the end, which <unclear>was</unclear>) <q>&#x0022;Is that all?&#x0022;</q> I suppose I did 0it rather well, as, upon leaving the piano, and seating myself beside a very plainly dressed young lady, and a very young clergyman with a serious face (curate and nephew to the man on prophecy &mdash; with different views,) <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> who were talking about <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> schools, and what length the scholars' pinafores ought to be, the lady turned to me--<q>&#x0022;Could you play us something, dear,&#x0022;</q> she said, <q>&#x0022;something mournful, if you know anything.&#x0022; </q> Of course she meant play <hi rend="italics">again,</hi> and of course she did not want to be rid of me. Nobody makes love (<hi rend="italics">she</hi> would not flirt) upon <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> schools and pinafores, do they?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>So I sat down and played again what <hi rend="italics">had</hi> drawn tears, indeed, it always affected me, but I did not like to cry, when no <num value="1">one</num> else did, and I heard the lady in pink laugh at a <hi rend="italics">sweet</hi> part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>Before I had quite reached the end, papa came up quickly (papa has no sort of <hi rend="italics">sympathy</hi> for music)--<q>&#x0022;Come, <persName><foreName>Henrietta</foreName></persName>;&#x0022;</q> and he took me up to the hostess, who said I played very nicely, us if I were a school girl!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>The last thing I saw was the figure of the lady in pink, still playing chess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>It was aggravating to hear papa in going home: <q>&#x0022;What a wretched dinner so badly cooked;&#x0022;</q> and mamma's: <q>&#x0022;Oh, my love, <persName n="Brown,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00638" reg="nearbymention:Brown,John,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName> has told me of a new biscuit for the babies.&#x0022;</q> Biscuit for the babies!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>Dinner! What was that to blighted hopes?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>However, I kept them to myself, and even told my dearest friend, when she asked me, that I was taken in (poor <persName><foreName>Amelia</foreName></persName> is not come out yet, and is anxious on those subjects) by a gentleman with plenty to say, and very attentive.
