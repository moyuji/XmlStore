<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>Honesty, inasmuch as it discards all those pretexts upon which the prosecution of this war has been justified, by the sanctimonious hypocrites to whom so many of its outrages are due; boldness, in so far as they must be very bold men, who dare deny to Omnipotence all share in the conduct of their affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>Men engaged in a good, but perilous cause, are wont, in hours of despondency, to feel their courage rise, and their spirits rebound, from the observance of those rights which consist in submitting themselves to the <name>Throne</name> of Grace, and humbly imploring its protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>True, the veil was thin enough, and was easily penetrated; but it <hi rend="italics">was</hi> a veil, how transparent so ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>Now they come out in their true colors, bold apostates, unblushing infidels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>They feel that Heaven &mdash; if there really be any Heaven, which they take leave to doubt &mdash; is decidedly against them, and cannot but be against them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>They either believe that there is no Supreme Being at all, or they know that he cannot smile upon such crimes as they perpetrate or abet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>They are conscious that if they succeed in this war it must be without the blessing of Heaven upon their cause, and they therefore decline to ask it. To appeal for assistance to the <name>Throne</name> of Grace, would be to alarm the people, who would conclude that the condition which made such appeal necessary, must be desperate indeed, and that there was no longer any hope in strong battalions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/> Upon the whole we applaud this proceeding, and recommend it for imitation to <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00176" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and his Cabinet.
