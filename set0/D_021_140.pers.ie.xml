<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Along the entire route we did not encounter a single obstruction, and not a battery, nor even a soldier--Union or rebel &mdash; was to be seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>But let me be more particular. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/> Yesterday afternoon, when we returned from our reconnaissance up the <rs>Appomattox</rs>, the signal was made on board the <name>Wachesett</name> flagship for all commanding officers of vessels to repair on board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>It was soon arranged that this morning the <rs>Stepping Stones</rs> and the <rs type="place">Island</rs> <persName n="Belle,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00032" reg="mostcommon:Belle,nomatch:0"><surname>Belle</surname></persName> should proceed up the <rs>Chickahominy</rs> and explore the rivers as high up as was practicable for the vessels to go. The light draught of the <num value="2">two</num> steamers, particularly the <rs>Stepping Stones</rs>, admirably accepted them for this duty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/> Early this morning we weighed anchor from <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName>, and were soon steaming down the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>, the <rs type="place">Island</rs> <persName n="Belle,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00033" reg="mostcommon:Belle,nomatch:0"><surname>Belle</surname></persName> following closely in our wake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>At <time value="8oclock">eight o'clock</time> we entered the month of the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, situated a few miles above <placeName reg="Jamestown, Prince Edward, Virginia" key="tgn,2419102">Jamestown</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Here we found a troublesome bar, and nearly ran aground in <measure n="5feet" type="distance">five feet</measure> water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>The <rs type="place">Island</rs> <persName n="Belle,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="mostcommon:Belle,nomatch:0"><surname>Belle</surname></persName> was not so fortunate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>She got stuck fast, and we had to turn back to her assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>This delayed us nearly an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>At length we succeeded in lowing our consort off, after parting a fawner, and proceeded on our on ward course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>The bar passed, the river rapidly deepened, alternating between <num value="3">three</num> and <num value="4">four</num> fathoms nearly all the way up as far as we went.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>In come places it was even deeper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>The lend was kept constantly going, to avoid sudden shelling, but the precaution, though a prudent <num value="1">one</num>, turned out to be hardly necessary. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/> Winding along the serpentine course of the river, we passed through some magnificent scenery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>In many places the river, on either side, was overhung with precipitous banks clothed with dense wood, with a rich undulating country beyond, and occasionally we caught glimpses of extensive fields of wheat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>In some places these fields came down to the water's edge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Sometimes, too, we encountertered a strip of low, marsby land, overrun with rank, coarse grass, while the broad leaves on the water lily grew plentifully far out into the stream. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/> Farm houses and private residences were constantly in view, and from nearly every inhabited dwelling a white sheat, tablecloth or anything that could be extemporized into a flag of truce, was displayed as soon as we have in sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>Hats, caps, and handkerchiefs, too, were waved at us in passing; but whether this may be rightly considered as indicative of genuine Union feeling or was done merely with a view to propitiate us, I am unable to say. As usual, wherever we have been in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, the people we saw were principally blacks; and truth impalas <unclear> </unclear> to add that they were for more demonstrative in their show of welcome than the waits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Occasionally, however, a white female or child would join in the handkerchief waving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>I need hardly say that white men were hardly to be soon, as most of them are either with the rebel army or have been killed off in the struggle their leaders have provoked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>A great number of houses were shut up, without the <unclear></unclear> at sign of inhabitants in or around them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/> After running up a considerable distance we came upon a log house, built on a steep slope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>There we saw a white man, who mat us on the landing in front of his house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>Above, on the high bank, were <num value="2">two</num> grown white females and <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> white children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>The man told us that we could run <measure n="20miles" type="distance">twenty miles</measure> further up, and that we could obtain a pilot at &#x0022;The Shades. &#x0022; He said he had been forced into the rebel army, but that he had deserted not liking the service, as he was no believer in secession. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/> Proceeding on our way several miles further up, the river became quite narrow and apprehensions began to be entertained that if we went much further we would not be able to turn round.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>At a sharp elbow we came on an intricate spot, but piles had been driven to mark the channel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>On our starboard side was a high bluff, on the summit of which stood a comfortable locking house, with the usual appurtenances of a residence of some pretension.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>Some gentlemen and <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> good looking ladies were standing under an open porch in front of the house, gazing at the novel <num value="8">eight</num> of <num value="2">two</num> armed <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> steamers passing so high up their narrow and tortuous stream; and, presuming that they were unacquainted with the intricacies of the channel at that spot, well might they look, in expectation, perhaps, of some catastrophe.--The piles were safety passed, when suddenly the leadman, from <num value="3.5">three and a half</num> fathoms, called <num value="2">two</num>, than <num value="1.5">one and a half</num>, then <num value="1">one</num> fathom, when bump went the bottom of the <rs>Stepping Stones</rs> on something hard &mdash; probably what is called a &#x0022;snag&#x0022; or &#x0022;sawyer,&#x0022; in the <rs>Mississippi</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>The apprehension, however, was only momentary, for the river immediately deepened almost as abruptly as it had shoaled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>At this moment some <num value="1">one</num> called out that fire or <num value="6">six</num> horsemen were galloping down towards the river, near the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>In a very few seconds our gun was swept round to the starboard side; but it was soon discovered that the man were in citizens' dress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>We therefore continued slowly on our course. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/> At this juncture the <rs type="place">Island</rs> <persName n="Belle,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00035" reg="mostcommon:Belle,nomatch:0"><surname>Belle</surname></persName> nearly got rebore again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>He backed out in time, and followed in our wake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>He was destined, however, to escape, not altogether scatheless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>His starboard paddle box ran foul of a pile driver, which rather incommoded the narrow channel, overturning the apparatus in a twinkling, but crushing his instate life-boat, which hung at the davits, so badly that he had to abandon it. On rounding another sharp elbow, it was clear that we had reached our limits, for the river had become so narrow that the trees on shore brushed against the sides of the vessels, and the turnings were very about.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>Great difficulty was experienced in turning round, the river being barely wide enough to admit of the length of the <rs>Stepping Stones</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>At length the feat was accomplished, and we were soon running down stream on our return from the exploration. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/> On our way down we called at the plantation of en elderly gentleman named <persName n="Turner,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00037" reg="mostcommon:Turner,nomatch:0"><surname>Turner</surname></persName>, where we purchased some eggs and milk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>He professed to be a staunch Union man, but could not help showing the cloven foot, by awaking of the rebel army as &#x0022;our army.&#x0022;--He told us we were in <placeName reg="New Kent, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1002713">New Kent county</placeName>, and that it was only <measure n="10miles" type="distance">ten miles</measure> across to <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>He said there had been none of &#x0022;our army&#x0022; at that place for some weeks, but that some Federals had been in the neighborhood about <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> since, a piece of information I am afraid I did not receive with much gratitude, seeing that I could have told the old gentleman so much <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure> ago. He charged <measure n="50cents" type="currency">50 cents</measure> a pound for his batter, and <measure n="25cents" type="currency">25 cents</measure> a dozen for eggs and, on our caterer demurring to the price, he thought to use a convincing argument by observing that &#x0022;our soldiers&#x0022; paid those prices.--We did not see it in that light, and remarked that there was a trifling difference between <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Sam</foreName></persName>'s well-fed sailors, who had the pier of every market on there <unclear> rs,</unclear> and <placeName reg="Jeff Davis, Noxubee, Mississippi" key="tgn,2420078">Jeff Davis</placeName>'s soldiers, who were glad to get what they could at any price.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>Besides, there was another trifling difference between a <unclear></unclear> <unclear>s </unclear> and good and lawful coin of the republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>That was a clincher and we got the eggs for <num value="10">ten</num> coats a dozen, receiving a small quantity of butter for some coarse park salt &mdash; an article more badly wanted than almost anything else.

<head>The people of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> during the late battle.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/> A negro, who ran away from this city during the battle of <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, tells a new associate of his at the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName> (a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> newspaper correspondent) that the people were on that day all on the tops of the houses and that they expected to see the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> driven into the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>When, however, they saw our troops running back towards <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, he adds that the whole city was in a most awful state of alarm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>The correspondent writes this to the <hi rend="italics">Herald,</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> puts it in print.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>We have no doubt the negro was here, for many persons did go up on the <rs>Capitol</rs> and other high places, to see if the battle field could be seen. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/> The rest, however, is a cheer fabrication &mdash; we suspect a fabrication of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> correspondent, not of the negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>The people of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> were, certainly, in painful suspense during the battle, and naturally enough, for many of them &mdash; most of them &mdash; had relatives and friends in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>But that there was any fear, anything approaching a panic, is absolutely false.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>We do not believe that any city, since the world began, ever <unclear>- ducted</unclear> itself with so much composure, so much composure, so much quiet dignity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>The prayers of all, of course, were for the success of our brave troops, but there was scarcely a man of a woman who had any doubt about it. They all reckoned upon their valor and patriotism, and they reckoned not in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>As to their alarm when they saw our troops running back to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, it is quite certain that they did not see that, if indeed they could have anything at all. Rather they saw the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> driven before them like sheep for a mile and diving into the swamp like muskrats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>They saw our men, if they saw anything in possession of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> camp with their tents, equipage of the field stores, baggage and cannon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>This, surely, could not have been to them a very alarming sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>A <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs>, who was brought in <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> expressed his surprise at seeing such an enormous number of our troops dressed in <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> overcoats. &#x0022;Everyone came off a dead <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>,&#x0022; said some person to whom he expressed his surprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>We ourselves saw half a dozen splendid <unclear>br-</unclear> fieldpieces going up <address><street n="Main street">Main street</street></address> last <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>, all marked <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>To talk about their beating us when we have their cannon, when we have <num value="1000">thousands</num> of their rifles and muskets, when we have their stores, and their tents, and their letters, and their portfolios, and have dressed a whole brigade in their overcoats, requires an amount of brave nobody but a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> ever had. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>We who saw it, knew it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>An unusual number were wounded in the hand, which arose from their having to part the bushes as they were advancing on the enemy. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>Yet though driven from the field, they were by no means conquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/> The news of the general destruction of the cotton crop in the <rs type="place">Mississippi Valley</rs>, which reached <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> previous to the sailing of the last steamer, produced a greater sensation in the <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> world than any other event of the war. It demonstrated more clearly than many hard fought battles that the people of the <rs>South</rs> are earnest in this revolution, and that their threats to destroy the crops, before allowing them to fall into the hands of the enemy, were not all idle talk and bluster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>Hostile from the beginning to the institutions of the <rs>South</rs>, drawn towards it only by a partial dependence for a supply of its products, and relying upon the promises of the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities to open the <rs>Southern</rs> ports, and furnish a sufficient quantity of cotton to keep the factories in motion, it is not surprising that the <name>Governments</name> of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> have looked upon the war with indifference, caring little for the result so long as their own interests were not interfered with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>Now, however, they see the promises of the wily <rs>Seward</rs>, and the statements of the <rs>Northern</rs> press, are not to be depended on. The capture of New Orleans, which was to have furnished cotton in abundance, was only the signal to apply the torch to the vast warehouses in that city and along the <rs>Mississippi</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>The advance of the <rs>Federal</rs> army, which was to have produced peace and concord, carries with it only destruction and desolation, and raises up among the people a still more bitter feeling of hostility. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/> The Union sentiment said to exist in every Southern State is not to be found; but, on the contrary, on the approach of the <rs>Northern</rs> army the native born citizens, without exceptions, apply the flame to their homes and their property, with the came patriotic self-devotion that characterized the <name>Swiss</name> in the time of <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName></persName> the <name>Bold</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>The lurid flames which it up the <rs type="place">Valley of the Mississippi</rs> was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> event of the war that has had its effect across the <rs>Atlantic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>Gloomy shadows of doubt have been thrown upon the hopes for Federal success, and questions raised as to the probable suffering the war may now bring upon the poorer classes of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and Continental <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>While they sneered at the efforts of our Embassaders, calmly read the accounts of battles given by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> press, and ridiculed our skirmishes in which so few were killed and so little accomplished, here is a new phase of the war which cannot be contemplated without evident alarm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>They see the cotton, for which they <unclear>-led</unclear> upon <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> promises, put forever beyond their reach by the planters themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>There is no longer dependence to be placed upon the declarations of the fair spoken reward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>However much he might desire to open the ports to the commerce of the world, the <name>Powers</name> of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> must now <unclear></unclear> that he is impotent to do so for the people of the <rs>South</rs> have demonstrated that they intend to commit to the <unclear>-mes</unclear> every bale of cotton every bale of sugar and every pound of tobacco, before any shall fall into his hands. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/> What the ultimate effect of this news may be in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, is only foreshadowed by a small item of foreign news published in yesterday's paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>In the <rs type="place">House of Commerce</rs> a member has given notice that he should call attention to the destruction of cotton in New Orleans, and inquire what effect it might have on <name>English</name> manufactures, and at the same time he would ask what mediative steps the <rs>Government</rs> intended to take.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>Very pertinent interrogatories, indeed, and questions which are likely to be pressed with increased energy upon the <rs>Government</rs> of both <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>Their people are suffering with increasing severity from the war and they see no prospect of relief either by the power of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> or the termination of the war. The <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> sees no signs of the end, nor what that end will be. For us it but remains to keep on fighting faithfully to the end, and to leave the diplomats of the great nations to solve the problem of their own difficulties as best they may. They have shown neither sympathy nor humanity towards us and expecting nothing, we can do our own works after our own way. Relying not on them we shall go on to fight and to burn cotton and tobacco whenever in danger of falling into the hand of the robbers from the <rs>North</rs>. </p> </div3>

<head>The necessity of strict discipline.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/> The <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>, as at present organized under the conscription, is strictly a regular army: as much so as the regular armies of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Rossiya" key="tgn,7002435">Russia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>In order to render it as effective as possible, the strictest attention should be paid, we conceive, to its discipline in every respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>It should not be treated as a mere militia force assembled <num value="1">one</num> day, and perhaps dispersed the <unclear></unclear> but should be placed upon the same footing with every other great standing army that exists in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>The mere drill is not all that is necessary to ensure its continued success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>It must be taught order, regularity, and economy in all its operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>As for courage, and a disposition to meet the foe there is no need to reach it there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>It has both in superabundance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/> But it must be taught to preserve order and discipline, as well after as before and during an action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>The great victory of <placeName reg="Shiloh, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101495">Shiloh</placeName> was neutralized, and came very near being converted, on the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> day, into a defeat by the shameful conduct of the men, who scattered all over the enemy's captured camps, and were engaged in plundering, when <persName n="Buell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00125" reg="mostcommon:Buell,nomatch:0"><surname>Buell</surname></persName> renewed the attack, to such an extent that not more than half of them could be rallied around the colors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>If our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> wish to gain victories which are to be of any profit, they must put an end to scenes like these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>They are not only utterly discreditable in themselves, but they endanger the safety of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>If the roll were called, in every company, both before and after the battle, and the absentees without leave held to a strict account for their absence, it would go far to remedy the evil.--The soldiers should be taught what many of them do not seem to know, that all the arms, munitions, and other property found deserted by the enemy on the field of battle, belong to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, and that to take them away, and appropriate them, is to plunder the lawful owner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>There has not been fought a battle, in which we were victorious, since the beginning of the war, in which the arms of the vanquished have not been almost entirely appropriated by private individuals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>In a vast number of instances, this has been done, not by soldiers who fought, and for whom there might be some semblance of excuse, but by stragglers and camp-followers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>The Government scarcely gained anything in the shape of arms or munitions by the great <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">battle of Manassas</rs>, while, probably, <num value="1000">thousands</num> of individuals now have in possession mementos of that field in the shape of muskets, swords, pistols, &#x0026;c. We earnestly entreat the officers of the army to do all they can to correct this matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>They have the power to do it, and if they will exercise it as they ought to do, it may be prevented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>The great obstacle heretofore has been, we fancy, the elective principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>Officers, in many instances, we have no doubt, have refrained from restraining their men as they ought to do, by fear of losing their votes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>Let that debasing and demoralizing system be put down by law, if the army is ever to be made as efficient as it might be. Let the soldiers, <num value="1">one</num> and all, understand that they are a standing army, subject to the stringent rule of the military code, and entitled, in no case, to claim an exemption from its operation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/> There surely ought to exist a power, somewhere, to prevent soldiers from straggling off from their companies, after a battle, or on a march, or pursuit, or retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>We are well aware that there will always be stragglers <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> and that it is impossible to suppress the evil entirely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>Yet, surely, under the influence of a proper discipline, it might in some degree be mitigated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>The remedy appears to us to consist in calling the roll, as we have proposed above. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/> When an officer is arrested for a military offence, he should be tried as soon as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>The trial should not be put off a day beyond the time absolutely necessary to enable him to prepare his defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>It is, we learn, the custom in our army to procrastinate, sometimes for weeks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>In the meantime, a battle may come on &mdash; the arrested officer is allowed a chance to redeem himself &mdash; he behaves well &mdash; and his offence is overlooked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>This system, if we are correct, (and if we are not, we stand open to conviction,) is calculated to do vast injury to the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>Punishment ought to be as mild as the nature of the case will admit but it ought to be certain in all cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>If an officer can wipe off an offence by good conduct in the field, there is no use for any military law at all. Of course, all credit ought to be given for gallantry; but it ought not to be established as a maxim that a gallant soldier is above the law. Gallantry might be very well pleaded in mitigation, but it cannot be established as a complete effect without overturning all discipline. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/> We are confident that there is scarcely an officer or soldier who, if he will reflect a moment, will not see the absolute necessity of establishing at once, and for the war, the strictest possible discipline in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>It is for their good, as well as for the good of the country which they have so manfully defended, and will continue to defend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>They can never succeed in the great object of their desire until they become thorough veterans as they are rapidly becoming, and veterans they never will be as long as they retain the slightest taint of the militia system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>They are in for the war, and they cannot help themselves if they would.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>It is for their interest, their comfort, their honor, that they should become as well disciplined as possible, in the shortest possible space of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>On the really good soldier &mdash; the man who is willing to do his duty on all occasions &mdash; regulations enforcing discipline bear very lightly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>He will always be found in the right place, and where the discipline is loose he will generally have a double portion of labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>Where, on the contrary, discipline is strict, he will find the duties equally distributed, and the <hi rend="italics">malingerer</hi>--as soldiers disposed to shuffle in the <rs>British</rs> army are called &mdash; made to do his part as well as the good soldier. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/> The obstruction of the <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231">Mississippi river</placeName>, at a point near those defences, was deemed essential to the successful defence of the city, and a very short time after he assumed command a raft was moored from <num value="1">one</num> bank to the other of the river, immediately under fire of both forts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>This raft was constructed of very large logs with <num value="2">two</num> immense chains passing under and fastening below; and they were likewise secured by riveting large, strong <unclear></unclear> across the top.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>It was clearly shown that no <unclear></unclear> could withstand the terrific <unclear></unclear> that was then passing over the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>An order was issued seizing a large number of ships and schooners and they were formed immediately, under that <unclear>-allant,</unclear> accomplished officer, <persName n="Hoggins,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00184" reg="mostcommon:Hoggins,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Hoggins</surname></persName>, into a line, and anchored with every care and precaution across the river near the forts. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/> Right here it is proper to add that there were very few <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class siege guns at either fort; that few we had, <persName n="Lovell,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00185" reg="nearbymention:Lovell,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lovell</surname></persName> had procured with great trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/> So far as the land defences of the city are in the question, it is only necessary to state that they were of such a character as to have enabled a very small force to hold them against any numbers which the enemy could have brought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>Every confidence was felt by men and officers, and universally shared by the community, that the city could not be taken, except the fleet of gunboats succeeded in destroying the defences above <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName> and coming down the river. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/> An open passage to the city was thus before them through agencies which no power of man could resist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>The river that still rising rapidly, the palace ground in <placeName reg="Fort Jackson, Plaquemines, Louisiana" key="tgn,2335345">Fort Jackson</placeName> was covered to the depth of <measure n="15inches" type="distance">fifteen inches</measure> with water, and the sharpshooters who had been sent to <unclear> </unclear> the enemy below the <unclear>f-</unclear> were driven by the water from that <unclear></unclear> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/> The bombardment of the mortar float was kept to-day and night for a week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>They succeeded in getting the range, and the number of shells which fell into <placeName reg="Fort Jackson, Plaquemines, Louisiana" key="tgn,2335345">Fort Jackson</placeName> is almost incredible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/><measure n="2days" type="date">Two days</measure> after he retired, it was said that the city had changed its purpose, and preferred a bombardment to occupation by the enemy.--<persName n="Lovell,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00191" reg="nearbymention:Lovell,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lovell</surname></persName> promptly ordered a train and proceeded to New Orleans, and immediately had an interview with <persName n="Monroe,Mayor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00192" reg="nearbymention:Monroe,John,T.,,"><roleName n="Mayor">Mayor</roleName> <surname>Monroe</surname></persName>, offering, if such was the desire of the authorities and people, to return with his command and hold the city as long as a man and shot was left! </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/> This offer not being repeated it was decided that the safety of the large number of unprotected women and children should be looked to, and that the fleet would be permitted to take possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>The raw and poorly armed infantry could have done nothing against the fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>The city would have been destroyed without any corresponding gain; and if the <rs>General</rs> commanding had adopted this course, he would have justly been charged with a wanton destruction of life and property. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/> The impression which prevails, that <persName n="Lovell,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00193" reg="nearbymention:Lovell,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lovell</surname></persName> had a large army under his command, is incorrect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>In fact, the demands for assistance had been so constant that he was almost stripped of everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>Not a gun had been sent to the <name>Department</name> since he had taken command; but, upon the contrary, as fast as he succeeded in gathering up something in men and materials for the defence of his Department, he was ordered to send it to other fields.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>He had no control over the navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>It had been urged that all the means of defence should be under his command, not this was refused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>A very short time before the fleet passed the forts he had <unclear></unclear> the commanding naval officer of the <unclear></unclear> to order the <term type="ship">ironclad steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Louisiana</rs>, <unclear> </unclear> be placed below <placeName reg="Fort Jackson, Plaquemines, Louisiana" key="tgn,2335345">Fort Jackson</placeName>, which was <unclear></unclear> It is confidently believed that if it <unclear></unclear> had been done New Orleans would have been saved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/> I state, upon any and every responsibility that belongs to a gentleman and a soldier, that <persName n="Lovell,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00195" reg="nearbymention:Lovell,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lovell</surname></persName> requested that iron-clad battery be sent to the eddy below <placeName reg="Fort Jackson, Plaquemines, Louisiana" key="tgn,2335345">Fort Jackson</placeName>, about <num value="3">three</num>-quarters of a mile, where she could have engaged the coming <unclear></unclear> and given the garrison timely notice that the hour of trial had come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>How she would have succeeded, may be unquestionably determined by the fact that the enemy failed to make any <hi rend="italics">impression</hi> upon her <hi rend="italics">impen- <milestone unit="column" n="6"/> etrable</hi> covering of iron, and was only destroyed after the surrender of both forts, to prevent her falling into the hands of the flast, it being impossible, from the unfinished state of her machinery, to move her. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>As before stated, the river was higher than it was ever known before, and from a few miles below the city to the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> was <num value="1">one</num> vast sheat of water, with the exception of the narrow levee on either side, and upon which there was not space enough to manage the guns that could have been effective against ships-of-war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/> If any obstruction could have stood the flood of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> and the furious storm that raged on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, by which the line of schooners was swept away, the city could not have fallen. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/> The forts were not armed with the largest guns, but they could have destroyed the fleet if it could have been held under their fire for any considerable period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>After they succeeded in passing to the front of the city, <persName n="Lovell,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00197" reg="nearbymention:Lovell,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lovell</surname></persName> had either to stand a bombardment without the power of replying, and by which the city would have been destroyed, and more than <num value="100000">one hundred thousand</num> helpless women and children exposed, or retire and let the enemy take possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>He followed in his decision the wishes of the people; he was ready and willing and so were his officers and men, to perish in the ruins of New Orleans rather than yield, if such a course had been agreed to by the inhabitants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>But it was decided otherwise; and in making this statement no reflection is intended upon the courage and loyalty of that unfortunate city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>A truer, braver community never felt the power of the invader; and, to-day, they are proud and defiant in their devotion to the cause. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/> I again repeat, but for the storm and flood, which combined to destroy the obstructions in the river.
