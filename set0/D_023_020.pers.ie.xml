<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/> The mingled emotions of terror and wrath which agitate the mind of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Doodle, are infinitely amusing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>It is quite evident that <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00204" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s &#x0022;change of base&#x0022; does not impose upon them.--They see, clearly enough, that he has been tremendously flogged, and that his &#x0022;strategic movement&#x0022; was nothing less than an old-fashioned fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>In <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, he boosted that his army &#x0022;had not met with a cheek,&#x0022; and that he meant to &#x0022;push <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00205" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,A.,Sidney,,"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName> to the wall.&#x0022; In <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, he writes that he is in an impregnable position, and that the army is safe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>A prodigious change of position, certainly, from an advance, sweeping his adversary before him, and pressing him to his last retreat, to a stand still on the defensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> can see this as plainly as we can, and they are horribly alarmed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>They have been flogged like cure and they howl accordingly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/> The change of tone in the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> newspapers is wonderful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>It could not withstand the weight of such an enormous force. --The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> papers took up the cry. All the arts of lying and exaggeration peculiar to that people were resorted to exalt the magnitude and strength of their armaments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>But after it was beaten &mdash; after it had fled under shelter of its gunboats, with the loss of <num value="40">forty</num> or <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> men, it was then represented as a mere handful, and the rebels, who before were a small, disorganised mob, were described as a powerful host, numbering <num value="217000">217,000</num> or <num value="220000">220,000</num> men. Such is the way in which <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Doodle accounts for his shortcomings in the military line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>Anything is better, they think, than a confession of the simple truth that our men are the better soldiers, and are always able to beat them on terms approaching equality. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/> The <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> announces in flaming capitals the huge Union meeting in New York, and parades conspicuously the hysterical orations of the various speakers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>That it was a great meeting in point of numbers may well be true, for New York has a large population, such as it is; but, if so, it only shows the necessity that is felt of a great effort.
