<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/> The facts in regard to the <num value="2">two</num> persons named in your note are as follows: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> Communications from the regular police of the country to the <rs>Executive</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> showed that disloyal persons in the <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">State of Alabama</placeName> were conducting treasonable correspondence with <name>Confederates</name>, <name>British</name> subjects, and <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> citizens, in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, aimed at the overthrow of the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName> by armed forces actually in the field and besieging the <rs>Capital</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Directions were thereupon given by the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs> to a proper agent to inquire into the correctness of the facts thus presented and this inquiry resulted in the establishment of their truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/> On the <date value="09-02">second day of September</date> the <rs>Superintendent</rs> of Police in the <placeName type="city" key="tgn,7007567">city of New York</placeName> informed the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs>, by telegraph, that he had under arrest <persName n="Rahming,,J.,C.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00037" reg="default:Rahming,J.,C.,,"><foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Rahming</surname></persName>, who had just arrived from <placeName key="tgn,2535807;tgn,7006630" n="0.136 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2535807;nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America;0.015 000000.0303	placename;tgn,7006630;nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America" reg="nassau river, florida, florida,Florida,United States,North and Central America;nassau,new providence,bahamas,north and central america,New Providence,Bahamas,North and Central America">Nassau</placeName>, where he had attempted to induce the owners of the <term type="ship">schr.</term> <rs type="ship">Arctic</rs> to take cannon to <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington, in North Carolina</placeName>, for the use of the rebels, and inquired what he should do with the prisoner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>This commitment was made on the <date value="09-02">2d day of September.</date> On the <dateStruct value="--17"><day reg="2">17th</day></dateStruct> of that month this prisoner, after due inquiry, was released from custody on his executing a bond in the penalty of <measure n="2500dollars" type="currency">$2,500</measure>, with a condition that he should thereafter bear true allegiance to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and do no act hostile or injurious to them while remaining under their protection. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/> I have to regret that, after so long an official intercourse between the <name>Governments</name> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, it should be necessary now to inform <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> Ministers that all executive proceedings, whether of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> or of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs>, are, unless disavowed or revoked by the <rs>President</rs>, proceedings of the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/> Certainly it is not necessary to announce to the <rs>British Government</rs> now that an insurrection, attended by civil and even social war, was existing in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> when the proceedings which I have thus related took place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>But it does seem necessary to state for the information of that Government that Congress is by the <rs>Constitution</rs> invested with no executive power or responsibility whatever, and, on the contrary, that the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> is, by the <rs>Constitution</rs> and laws, invested with the whole executive power of the <rs>Government</rs>, and charged with the supreme direction of all municipal or ministerial civil agents, as well as of the whole land and naval force of the <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> Union, and that, invested with those ample powers, he is charged by the <rs>Constitution</rs> and laws with the absolute duty of suppressing insurrection as well as of preventing and repelling invasion; and that for these purposes he constitutionally exercises the right of suspending the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus,</hi> whenever and wheresoever and in whatsoever extent the public safety, endangered by treason of invasion in arms, in his judgment requires. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/> The proceedings of which the <rs>British Government</rs> complain were taken upon information conveyed to the <rs>President</rs> by legal police authorities of the country, and they were not instituted until after he had suspended the great writ of freedom in just the extent that in view of the perils of the <rs>State</rs> he deemed necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>For the exercise of that discretion he, as well as his advisers, among whom are the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> and the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs>, is responsible by law before the highest judicial tribunal of the <rs>Republic</rs>, and amendable also to the judgment of his countrymen, and the enlightened opinion of the civilized world. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/> A candid admission contained in your letter relieves me of any necessity for showing that the <num value="2">two</num> persons named therein were neither known nor supposed to be <name>British</name> subjects when the proceedings occurred, and that in every case subjects of <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty</name> residing in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and under their protection, are treated during the present troubles in the same manner, and with no greater or less rigor, than <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> citizens. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/> The military prison which was used for the temporary detention of the suspected parties is a fort constructed and garrisoned for the public defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>The military officer charged with their custody has declined to pay obedience to the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus,</hi> but the refusal was made in obedience to an express direction of the <rs>President</rs>, in the exercise of his functions as <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs> of all the land and naval forces of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Although it is not very important, it certainly is not entirely irrelevant to add, that, so far as I am informed, no writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> was attempted to be served, or was even sued out or applied for in behalf of either of the persons named; although in a case not dissimilar the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> was issued out in favor of another <name>British</name> subject, and was disobeyed by direction of the <rs>President</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/> The British Government have candidly conceded, in the remonstrance before me, that even in this country, so remarkable for so long an enjoyment by its people of the highest immunities of personal freedom, war, and especially civil war, cannot be conducted exclusively in the forms and with the dilatory remedies provided by municipal laws, which are adequate to the preservation of public order in a time of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Treason always operates, if possible, by surprise, and prudence and humanity, therefore, equally require that violence concocted in secret shall be prevented, if practicable, by unusual and vigorous precaution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>I am fully aware of the inconveniences which result from the practice of such precaution, embarrassing communities in social life, and affecting, perhaps, trade and intercourse with foreign nations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/> But the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> people, after having tried in every way to avert civil war, have accepted it at last as a stern necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>The chief interest, while it lasts, is not the enjoyments of society, or the profits of trade, but the saving of national life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>That life saved, all the other blessings which attend it will speedily return, with greater assurance of continuance than ever before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>The safety of the whole people has become, in the present emergency, the supreme law, and so long as the danger shall exist, all classes of society equally, the denizen and the citizen cheerfully acquiesce the measures which that law prescribes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/> This Government does not question the learning of the legal advisers of the <rs>British Crown</rs> or justice of the deference which <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty</name> pays to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Nevertheless the <rs>British Government</rs> will hardly expect that the <rs>President</rs> will accept their explanations of the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, especially when the <rs>Constitution</rs>, thus expounded, would leave upon him the sole executive responsibility of suppressing the existing insurrection, while it would transfer to Congress the most material and indispensable power to be employed for that purpose. --Moreover, these explanations find no real support in the letter, much less in the spirit, of the <rs>Constitution</rs> itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>He must be allowed, therefore, to prefer and be governed by the view of our organic national law which, while it will enable him to execute his great trust with complete success, receives the sanction of the highest authorities of our own country, and is sustained by the general consent of the people, for whom alone that Constitution was established. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/> The naval armada is the last card which the <rs>North</rs> has to throw in the great game between the sections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>It has failed in all its previous calculations and efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>Its &#x0022;short, sharp, and decisive&#x0022; campaign has come to nought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>It has nowhere, (except in <num value="1">one</num> transmontane district, which it is now evacuating,) got into our territory; and <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and <persName n="Orleans,,N.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00097" reg="default:Orleans,N.,,,"><foreName>N.</foreName> <surname>Orleans</surname></persName>, which were to be in its possession by <dateStruct><month>August</month></dateStruct>, are farther and safer from their grasp now than ever before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>Nowhere have the <rs n="Unionist" type="political">Unionists</rs> of the <rs>South</rs> risen against the <name>Secessionists</name>, and put them down; nowhere given any serious domestic trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>No grand negro insurrection has burst forth to paralyze the <rs>Southern</rs> arm, and expose the <rs>South</rs> an easy prey to the <rs>Northern</rs> enemy; never were the slaves more orderly and loyal, never was a servile population before known to sympathize so strongly with the cause of the master race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>Nor are the <rs>South</rs> starved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/><rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> corn brings only <measure n="50cents" type="currency">fifty cents</measure> a bushel, and wheat but <measure n="80cents" type="currency">eighty cents</measure>, and, if it be alleged that these prices are too low in consequence of the penny-wise stinginess of the <rs>Government</rs> which fixes the prices; yet the cereals are so abundant that <measure n="1dollars" type="currency">$1</measure> for wheat, and <measure n="70cents" type="currency">70 cents</measure> for corn are conceded to be fair prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>If bacon is dear, if is only because the usual sources of supply for that particular sort of meat are out of and not from any scarcity of meat in general, Large grain crops and another year will bring up the supply to the full figure of the demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>The South is neither starved nor naked, having abundant bread, meat, rice, sugar, wool, leather, and cotton, and all calculations of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> on that score are brought to nought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>We have never yet lost a pitched battle, and have won many.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>Our population are united.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>The war is popular, and commands the enthusiastic support of our whole people, young and old, men and women, boys and girls, blacks and whites.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>We are paying nothing abroad for the war. We are conducting if without incurring a cent of debt to the outside world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>Instead of crippling our resources, it is multiplying them in a <num value="1000">thousand</num> modes and forms &mdash; more progress having been accomplished in the mechanical and manufacturing industry of the <rs>South</rs> in the last <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> than had been accomplished in a dozen years before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>We have lost but few prisoners; have taken <num value="1000">thousands</num> which we hold in custody, and other <num value="1000">thousands</num> which we have <sic>parolled</sic> and let go. Not more than <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> of our regiments have been disbanded, and this chiefly from sickness, while we have destroyed and demoralized a whole army of <num value="50">fifty</num> or <num value="60">sixty</num> regiments.--Scarcely any, if any at all, of our regiments have quitted the service; while the <rs>North</rs> have but few regiments now in the field, of the many legions that <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> took up arms. --In short, the war on their part has been a failure throughout, while on ours it has been a signal failure nowhere, and in no respect.--Our Government has held our impetuous soldiers too much in check, and required our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> to stand too much on the defensive; and any successes which we have failed to achieve in consequence, we have foregone by design. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/> Such is the state of the issue, and the facts and situation of the campaign up to this time, as between the <name>South</name> and <name>North</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>The Washington Government feels the necessity of doing something positive, striking, and decisive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>It saw the thing was hopeless on land, and they have accordingly fitted out a prodigious naval armament for a formidable demonstration against some point on our seaboard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>It was the last arrow they had in their quiver.--If this fails them; if the <rs>South</rs> survive this blow, then the case becomes most hopeless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>They cannot whip us on land, though they boast <num value="20000000">twenty millions</num> to our <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="8">eight</num>.--Our slaves will not rise and destroy us at their bidding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>Our <rs n="Unionist" type="political">Unionists</rs> will not invite them into our territory, and help them reduce us to obedience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>Nor will we starve; and though our clothing is homely, we persistently refuse to go naked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>There is but <num value="1">one</num> chance left, therefore, for our subjugation; and that, by the agency of their boasted squadron now hovering upon our seaboard. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/> In this point of view the expedition has more significance than would otherwise belong to it. It is to demonstrate, not only for the present, but for the future, what the <rs>North</rs> can do against the <rs>South</rs> by sea. It is not only to test our vulnerability from the <rs>North</rs> on the water side, but from any other naval power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>We have great faith in our practical impregnability from that sort of attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>The enemy may land on exposed points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>They may successfully attack a fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>They may seize a strong position here and there on our seaboard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>They may effect lodgements from which they may be able to annoy us during a period of war. But further than that, we have no fear of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>They cannot penetrate the country to any distance from any base line of attack established in that way. They can establish themselves no where in force beyond the sight of their sails, or the hearing of their broad sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>We shall soon see what truth there be in these opinions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>We shall soon know whether <num value="6000000">six millions</num> of people are to be annihilated by a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> fleet. </p> </div3>
