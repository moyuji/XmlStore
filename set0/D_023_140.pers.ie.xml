Whether it was drinking, fighting, gambling, or any other amusement, he was a scholar, and he who went ahead of him at either game had to rise very early in the morning. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> There was a logrolling at old <persName n="Templar,,Squire,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="default:Templar,Squire,,,"><foreName>Squire</foreName> <surname>Templar</surname></persName>'s, and, after the work was done, the crowd adjourned to the spring for <q>&#x0022;refreshments&#x0022;</q>--<num value="1">one</num> of a <num value="2">two</num>-gallon jug. Seating himself on the ground, with the jug between his knees and arm cup in his hand, <persName><foreName>Mike</foreName></persName> looked around very solemnly and remarked: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> <q>&#x0022;Boys, I cum mighty nigh getting religion once!&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> The <q>&#x0022;boys,&#x0022;</q> who well knew <persName><foreName>Mike</foreName></persName>'s character for ungodliness, shouted at the remark, and the grave manner in which it was delivered. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> <q>&#x0022;You needn't larf, drot ye!&#x0022;</q> he growled, &#x0022;It's a fact, drot of it ain't! </p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> &#x0022;Yes, you're desprit anxious to hear it now; but jes now you larfed like ye thought I was a fool.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>I've a mighty good notion not to tell a mite of it, </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> <q>&#x0022;Ah, <persName><foreName>Mike</foreName></persName> do tell it!&#x0022;</q> plead several. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> <q>&#x0022;Well, of you'll promise not to interrupt me more'n <measure n="20minutes" type="date">twenty minutes</measure>, I'll spin it out, &#x0022;</q> said he. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> The promise was readily given, and the old sinner prepared to relate his experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>His preparations consisted in pouring a cup-full of whiskey, half of which he drank and held the remainder in his hand as a reserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Then he stowed a huge chunk of <q>&#x0022;nigger- head&#x0022;</q> into the most open portion of his countenance, and began: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> &#x0022;When I was about <measure n="25years" type="date">twenty-five years</measure> old, boys, I was an awful hard case, thar's no doubt of it. Old age, hard times, an' hard drink has nilly made a Christian of me, though, drot of they haint!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>But when I was young, over in <placeName reg="Walton, Georgia, United States" key="tgn,2000438">Walton county</placeName>, Jorgy, thar warn't a man, boy, nor nigger, in the settlement that could smell my track at rascality an' gin' ral wickedness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>I was the terror of chil'un, the pest of men, an the bomination of female wimmin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The old men made me the pint of all thar leeturs to thar boys, telling 'em of they didn't mind they'd be as mean as Murrel, <persName n="Tupper,,Mike,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="default:Tupper,Mike,,,"><foreName>Mike</foreName> <surname>Tupper</surname></persName>, or the devil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The old wimmin pinted me out to thar gals as an institution of onmixed villainy, an' them as had young chil'un, threatened 'em wi' me of they got anyways rambunctions.--Little chaps would run under the bed when they seed me a cummin', as of I war a grand carryvan, an' even the dogs refused to bark at me!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Ah! I war a hard case, an' no mistake in the ticket! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> &#x0022;Well, while I war thus making myself a name among the inhabitants of the yearth, thar happened a big, double-jinted pertracted meetin close to my house, an' to it I went, as might he expected, for I allers went whar thar war a crowd, jest cos I knowed nobody wanted me thar, an' for the further reason that I usually found a chance to drink, gamble, an have a good time gin' rally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>On that 'casion I was more'n ever disposed to have some fun, an pitched on <num value="1">one</num> of the preachers for my subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>He was an awful lookin' chap, he was an' his looks an' my karacter would a started the boss devil of all into a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>He was ni'ly as long as a fence rail, an' not much bigger, with a face as sharp as a meat-axe, an' a voice twice as sharp as his face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>But, <name n="God" type="God">God</name>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>how that feller could sing, an pray, an' preach, an' convert!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Thar warn't a preacher in the country that could hold him a candle at prayin', drinkin' red-eye whiskey, or eatin' fried chicken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Ef it hadn't been fur the whiskey an' chicken, though, he'd a resigned his commission, fur he was amazin' fond of 'em.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Boys, he loved whiskey an' chicken. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> &#x0022;They was holdin' the meetin' under a arbor, kivered with bresh, an', as soon as it was dark up I clamb on top of the concern, with the intention o' given old hatchet-face a lift with his sermon, an' managed to place myself right over head without bein' diskivered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>I'd bought a whole passel o' fire-crackers an' tied 'em round a ole barl hoop, an' fixed a string to it so's I could let it down through the bresh.--Lights war very skase, enyhow, and the preacher, in rippin' round, had put out the only candle about the pulpit, which left him in the dark, in more ways than <num value="1">one</num>! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> &#x0022;Well, he'd got in a big way, an' jest as he'd got to rippin' an' rantin about death an' the devil, an' brimstun, an' sich other foolery, I put fire to the crackers, an' let the hoop down so that the thing hung to his head, with the crackers a poppin' and fizzin' about him like a swarm o' fiery sarpents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Boys, it was rich!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>That preacher jest made <num value="1">one</num> big effort, like a cat jumpin' out'n a barl, an' went over that pulpit with a yell like a <rs n="Mohawk" type="nativeamerican">Mohawk</rs> Ingin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>He lit atop of a ole woman what weighed bout half a thousan', an she fainted as easy as a young gal in a harrycane, while her husban't run up an' give him a jerk that nearly broke him off at the waist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>He run agin a big fractions brother, an' he hit him just in the ribs, knocking him about a rod, an' nearly bringing his <num value="2">two</num> ends together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>All this time the wimmin was a screamin' an' hollerin' &#x0027;Glory!&#x0027; an' the men was groanin' an' prayin, an' the boys whoopin' an' cussin', an' everything was havin' a rale jolly time of it. After a while the preacher broke through the crowd an' tuck to the woods, whar he had a right smart chance o' fun, all to hisself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>He jumped up an' down faster'n a cat with hickry nut hulls on his feet, an' danced round like he war tryin' his awfulest to go distracted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>He finally managed to git shet of the thing, an' then he sneaked off to his tent, an' had so more to say that night. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> &#x0022;In the meantime I tried to get off'n the arbor; but instead o' gettin' down like any other fool, I tumbled off, neck and heel, right on top of a whole raft o' niggers, who was standin' with thar mouths open wide enough to swaller a <rs n="corn sheller" type="product">corn-sheller</rs>. <hi rend="italics">Thar </hi> was hollerin' worth talkin' about.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>I don't know whether they took me for <persName><foreName>Gabriel</foreName></persName> or the devil; but they tuck on like I was a little o' both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>This raised another uproar among the wimmin, and for a few moments thar was a sound like heaven an' yerth war comin' together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Artir a while they cooled down, while I sneaked off and got as drunk as a biled owl, thinkin' I orter be doin' somethin' to wind up the occasion in a proper manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>As good luck would have it, nobody didn't know who I was, an' as I didn't feel like it was my duty to enlighten 'em, they broke up the meetin' for that night, some thinkin' it war a angel, an' some thinkin' it war the devil. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> &#x0022;I spent the rest o' the night drinkin' licker an' playin' old sledge, an' next day I felt meaner'n <num value="40">forty</num> cent whiskey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>I lay bout the woods an' slep' nearly all day, an' when the night meetin' commenced, I sidied down to the stand, feelin' rale solemn an' bad, I tell you. --Party soon the excitement got up, an' they commenced cuttin' up powerfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Thar was a young, good-lookin' preacher thar that could beat all creation convertin' wimmen an' gals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>He warn't as smart as old hatchet-face, but he roared it out in sich big style, an' flung out so </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> many <num value="3">three</num>-cornered words, an' dressed so fine, that the female portion of the flock tuck to him like a piny woods pig to a tater patch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Thar was a little gal in the crowd that I loved, harder'n a <num value="40">forty</num> year old sinner could cus, though I'd never offered to speak to her, for fear she'd knock my brains out wi' something.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>While I was standin' thar listenin' at the young preacher gettin' up in the top story of the preachin' business, the gal screamed out-- &#x0027;Glor-e-e!&#x0027; and tumbled right down in the alter, among a whole crowd o' men an' wimmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>That sorter in'treated me, an' the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing I know'd, boys, may I be drot ef. I warn't right down thar, too, kickin' up as much racket as the best of 'em!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The preacher know'd me very well, an when he seen me go down, he bawled out, &#x0027;Glory to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>brethren, we've got the vilest sinner in the whole lot!&#x0027; That riled me a little, an' ef I'd a had him out I'd made him seen more fire than ole hatchet-face did the night afore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>But I didn't have them wicked thoughts long, for, to tell the truth, I felt rale solemn, an' was gettin' converted as fast as ever you seen a man. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/> Well, the wimmin hollered, an' the men groaned, an' the preacher converted a while longer, an' then they broke, up. But, afore they made a final close, the preacher cum &#x0027;round an&#x0027; talked to we mourners, an' told me to go right out into the woods, whar nobody could see me, an' pray for myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>So off I put, an' went right straight to a thicket whar I'd played cards the night afore, an' whar I thought nobody couldn't see me. It wasn't very dark, but I allers was as cowardly in the night as a mean nigger, an' ef I hadn't been so intent on gettin' religion, I wouldn't a went into that place for the best hoss on the ground; but, as it was, I marched right inter the bushes an' got down on my bones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Boys, do ye think I could think of any word to say ? Drot ef I could!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>But I warn't long without somethin' to do. Thar was an ole he goat about that place that made a business o' buttin' everything that come in reach o' him, an' he happened to be in that identical thicket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>I didn't know whether he was tryin' to get religion or no, but he didn't act much like it.--When he seen me git down on my knees an raise my hands, he thought a fight war 'bout to begin, and, with a big roar, he cum at me like a thunder gust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>He didn't quite git me, though, for I just tumbled over back-ards, an' got up a running an' kep a goin' wusser'n a greyhoun with a tin pan to his tail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>I run over more logs an' agin more trees an' saplins than I thought was in the country, an' hollered every jump, for I was shore the old chap of all was arter me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>A workman named <persName n="Maasch,,Karl,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="default:Maasch,Karl,,,"><foreName>Karl</foreName> <surname>Maasch</surname></persName> has been accused of having been concerned in the commission of <num value="13">thirteen</num> murders and many <num value="100">hundred</num> robberies, of which he confesses himself guilty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>The number of his transgressions is, however, probably, far greater than that indicated in the crowded list already made out against him. Among modern criminals, Dumollard alone, who was executed some months ago in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, can be compared in the enormity of his crimes with the monster <rs>Maasch</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Not only was Maash, like Dumollard, guilty of the most cold-blooded cruelty in the numerous murders which he seemed to take fiendish delight in perpetrating, but the hideous manner in which he treated the still warm bodies of his female victims sinks him far below the level of the savage or the brute. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/><num value="1">One</num> of the most horrifying atrocities which they committed was on a night in <date value="1861-05">May, 1861,</date> when <persName n="Maasch,,Karl,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="default:Maasch,Karl,,,"><foreName>Karl</foreName> <surname>Maasch</surname></persName> and some of his band broke forcibly into the house of a miller named Baumgart, at Carsdorf, murdered the miller and his wife, his daughter, <num value="2">two</num> sons, and a maid, and robbed the house of everything that was portable and valuable, including, it is believed, a considerable sum of money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>The murders, too, were committed in a manner so atrocious as to arouse the population into a frenzy, and the most persevering exertions were made to obtain a clue to the guilty parties. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/> The noblest detectives of <placeName reg="Berlin, Berlin, Deutschland" key="tgn,7003712">Berlin</placeName> were sent to aid the local police; but the only person to whom suspicion pointed, an assistant who slept in the house, and who was the only <num value="1">one</num> who escaped death, was at last set free, under the conviction that he was innocent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>A strange incident, however, at length occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/><num value="2">Two</num> farm laborers, of the village of <placeName reg="Warsin">Warsin</placeName>, near Stargardt, were <num value="1">one</num> morning walking together on their way to their work in the fields, when it came on to rain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>For the sake of greater shelter against the wet, <num value="1">one</num> of them proposed that they should proceed to their destination for the rest of the way by a path leading through the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>This being agreed on, the peasants had not been <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure> in the forest, when <num value="1">one</num> of them espied at some distance through the trees the upper half of the body of a man sticking up out of the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Their hearts leaped to their mouths.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/><num value="1">One</num> immediately started off with all the speed he could put forth, while the other, more self-possessed, retreated more slowly, keeping his eye fixed on the object in question, which gradually sank out of sight into the earth. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/> The peasants instantly made known to the owner of the estate the strange thing they had witnessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>The police was sent for, and a number of persons, with all dispatch, proceeded to the mysterious spot which was pointed' out by the laborers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> it seemed as though the men must have deceived themselves or were carrying on a practical joke; for at the spot indicated there appeared to be nothing like a hole in the earth, as the grass covered the ground all round about.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>On closer investigation, however, a slit was found in the grass in the form of a square.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>It was the top of a trap door covered with turf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>On forcing this open and descending, a large cavity was discovered, from which, however, the late occupiers had already fled. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/> The hole itself, which was roofed with trees overlaid with turf, was divided into <num value="2">two</num> rooms, the walls lined with boards &mdash; a stove, <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> beds, a ladder, victuals, and cooking utensils being present, and making a very snug underground dwelling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>In addition to these articles, there were present quantities of objects identified as having been stolen from various houses in the neighboring country, in which burglarious robberies and murders have been committed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>Axes, firearms, and other weapons, as well as a considerable number of thieves tools, were likewise found. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/> The police now found themselves on the right track.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>Various circumstances &mdash; the description given by the peasants of the occupiers of the cavern, as well as indications found in the cavern itself &mdash; led to the suspicion that the person so seen was none other than the notorious workman, <persName n="Maasch,,Karl,Frederick,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="default:Maasch,Karl,Frederick,,"><foreName>Karl</foreName> <foreName>Frederick</foreName> <surname>Maasch</surname></persName>, who was conjectured to be the leader of the band of robbers who had so long infested the neighborhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>Against him and his crew the search was henceforth specially directed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>Maasch had been for some time a laborer on the estate of Deazon, near Pyritz, in which neighborhood he was born.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>He was never married, and had been published frequently for theft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>He was a scoundrel of the lowest modes of life, and sprang from a family hereditarily criminal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>He had fled from the place mentioned above on account of the discovery of new thefts committed by him, and had not been seen for several years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> the efforts of the police to take him were completely foiled, and he was strenuously aided in his concealment by the rest of the band, consisting for the most part of his family. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/> His mother and brother (<persName n="Martin,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Martin,Richard,,,:1"><surname>Martin</surname></persName>) lived together at Schonon, Pyritz, about <num value="6">six</num> <name>English</name> miles from the retreat in the forest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>In their dwelling were found an axe, on which traces of blood were still discovered, and a quantity of articles belonging to the same robberies as did those found in the hole in the woods so that at length those who had committed the <name>Baumgart</name> murder were in the hands of justice, if we except their leader, <persName><foreName>Karl</foreName></persName>, Maasch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>On a microscopic examination of the <num value="3">three</num> axes from the hole and the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> found at the house of <persName n="Martin,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Martin,Richard,,,:1"><surname>Martin</surname></persName>, unmistakable traces of this horrid <num value="6">six</num> fold murder were perceived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>On <num value="1">one</num> axe, stuck, a small portion of human brain; on all <num value="4">four</num>, human hair mingled with clotted blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>The hair agreed completely with that of the murdered persons, and that of the servant maid was identified with particular clearness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/> On <num value="1">one</num> of the axes there still clung red woollen threads, precisely similar to those of the material of which <persName n="Baumgart,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Baumgart,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Baumgart</surname></persName>'s nightcap was made, and which she wore on the night of the murder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>Another axe still retained traces of the children's bedclothes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>The wife of <persName n="Martin,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Martin,Richard,,,:1"><surname>Martin</surname></persName> sealed her guilt by hanging herself in prison, after having been accused of participating in the <name>Baumgart</name> murders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>The principal party, however, still remained at large; he had been driven from the <name>Soldan</name> country by the exertions made to capture him. What, however, the police could not achieve with the utmost endeavors was again left to be accomplished by a happy accident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/><num value="1">One</num> beautiful summer's evening a citizen of Frankfort-on-the-Oder observed a drunken man in the public streets behaving himself in a very shameless manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>On addressing some words of indignant remonstrance to him, he received an answer of the very coarsest description, and was compelled to call a police sergeant. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/> Against the latter the stranger pointed a loaded pistol.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>He was, however, finally overpowered, and taken to the lock-up.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>A quantity of arms, thieves' tools, and money, were found on him, and it appears that in the earlier part of the evening he had been treating several workmen, whom he met quite accidentally on the road to the town, with copious potations of brandy, and had himself become intoxicated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>He finally confessed that he was the long sought <persName n="Maasch,,Karl,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="default:Maasch,Karl,,,"><foreName>Karl</foreName> <surname>Maasch</surname></persName>, and had only just come from committing a fresh murder and robbery, in which he had taken the money found upon him. Near Hackleburg, <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> before, a commercial man had been shot in the forest and robbed of his money; the horses galloped on to the village of <placeName reg="Hackleburg, Marion, Alabama" key="tgn,2003759">Hackleburg</placeName>, drawing behind them the vehicle containing the lifeless body of the merchant.--Maasch, who confessed to this murder, was delivered up at Sodlin to the authorities engaged in investigating the <name>Baumgart</name> murders. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/> In the course of the trial not less than <num value="140">one hundred and forty</num> witnesses were examined, and great numbers of depositions were read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>If this request seems like the <num value="1">one</num> bright spot in the conduct of the chief criminal, yet it was of no avail against the proofs adduced, that <num value="3">three</num> of his comrades at least had assisted him in <num value="1">one</num> or more of his numerous murders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>As the subject is an important <num value="1">one</num> just now, we extract some of his remarks, in addition to other publications recently made in this paper on the same subject: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/> He called attention to the fact that while vaccination is almost universal in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and children must be vaccinated before they can enter school, not <num value="1">one</num> in <num value="4">four</num> of our population have adopted this precaution against infection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>This negligence, he remarked, results from our scattered and sparse population, which has rendered us comparatively secure against the spread of any infections disease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>He gave a learned and interesting review of the early practice of inoculation, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> practiced in <placeName key="tgn,1000111" n="1.000 120" reg="zhonghua">China</placeName> <measure n="2400years" type="date">2400 years</measure> ago and introduced into <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> by <persName n="Montague,Lady,Mary,Motley,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="default:Montague,Mary,Motley,,"><roleName n="Lady">Lady</roleName> <foreName>Mary</foreName> <foreName>Motley</foreName> <surname>Montague</surname></persName> about <dateStruct value="1720--"><year reg="1720">1720</year></dateStruct>, and the subsequent discovery of kine pox by <persName n="Jenner,Lieutenant,Edward,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="default:Jenner,Edward,,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lt.</roleName> <foreName>Edward</foreName> <surname>Jenner</surname></persName>, and the introduction therefrom of vaccination instead of the more dangerous practices of inoculation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/><persName n="Jenner,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="nearbymention:Jenner,Edward,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Jenner</surname></persName> had observed that furing the prevalence of small-pox, milk maids never contracted the disease, and after careful investigation of the cause of their immunity, he found that they were inoculated from the udders of the cow with a disease precisely like vaccination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>He also was convinced that the cows took the disease from the feet of the horse through the hands of the grooms, who, from cleaning their hoofs would sometimes milk the cows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>From this singular discovery arose the practice of vaccination with the kine pox, which is as effectual a preventive of small pox as the disease itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>Like measles, or other infections diseases, occasional instances of <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> infection occur, but they are very rare, and seldom fatal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>True vaccination, the <rs>Doctor</rs> urged, is never fatal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>The improper use of old and poisonous or putrid virus causes bad arms and occasional deaths, and hence arises the general dread of vaccination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>To avoid such results required an intelligent use of the simple agencies employed, and for this reason vaccination should be confined to careful hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>He described the process of vaccination, and made it very simple and easily comprehended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>Nature seems to have adopted the kine pox exactly, and beautifully, to man's convenience, for we find that it develops itself in <num value="14">fourteen</num> distinct <q>&#x0022;cells,&#x0022;</q> from each of which lymph may be obtained without disturbing the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>This should be done on the <num value="8" type="ordinal">eighth</num> day, as is delayed the vaccine fluid hardens and becomes less effective.--The effect of vaccination is usually not perceptible for <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>, when inflammation appears, then secular blister forms, accompanied with irritation and slight fever, until after <num value="10">ten</num> or <measure n="12days" type="date">twelve days</measure>, when a scab forms, and on the <num value="20" type="ordinal">twentieth</num> day the scab falls, and inflammation disappears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>It does not usually interfere with ordinary duties or cause the loss of a single meal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>He urged the importance of an organized system of vaccination.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/> It is well known to you that I opposed the secession of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>Not that I doubted the right of secession, for I always maintained it, and maintain it still--[applause]--but from reasons of policy only, I desired the co-operation of the slave States for the purpose of making an honest and earnest effort to maintain our rights in the <rs>Union</rs>, if possible, and defend them out of it, if necessary,--[Cheers.] I believed that the preservation of the <rs>Union</rs> was an object worthy of patriotic desire &mdash; an earnest desire, with an united South, to make <num value="1">one</num> more effort to rescue it from destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>I had strong hope of success; at all events, I thought the experiment worthy of being made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>My feeble counsels were overruled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/><placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, as she had a right to do, withdrew from the <rs>Union</rs> and resumed her separate independence, and from that hour I resolved that her fate should be my fate, that her people should be my people, and that where they might be buried, there would I be buried also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>[Cheers.] The ship is yet fast to its moorings; the passengers and cargo on board are ready for the voyage; the sky looks stormy; the captain is at his post, and the sails are unfurled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>He submits the question of setting sail to the passengers, and, by a large majority, they vote in the affirmative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>Her cables are loosed, and her sheets are given to the winds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>Anon a storm springs up &mdash; the waves are lashed into fury; the vessel trembles and creaks from stem to stern; she springs a leak, and the cry is, <q>&#x0022;to the pumps ! to the pumps !&#x0022;</q> What would you think of the man, who would turn a deaf ear to the cry, because he had voted against the embarkation!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>The passengers would hurl him into the boiling deep, to struggle and perish in the angry billows &mdash; and so say I.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/><placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> lay at port, angry, enraged, dissatisfied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>The question was, whether she should cut from the <rs>Union</rs> and trust herself to the winds and waves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>The majority said yes; whilst others, with myself, equally true and patriotic, said no; don't be hasty; perhaps the gathering cloud will pass away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>The majority said cut loose, and the vessel was given to the sea, and now the storm is up; the ocean is lashed into anger, and the cry is heard from all quarters, <q>&#x0022;to the pumps!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>to the pumps!&#x0022; </q> and I say, woe betide the man who turn a deaf year to the thrilling summons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>[Cheers.] --There is work to do &mdash; bloody work &mdash; work for brawn and brain &mdash; work for all. Let every man perform his part, and bring our bark into calm waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>It is freighted with the lives, happiness, and liberties of <num value="8000000">eight millions</num> of human beings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>The principles of good government, the fate of <rs n="Republican" type="political">republican</rs> institutions, are all in danger of being submerged in the boiling deep. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/> <orgName n="Our Country" type="newspaper">Our country</orgName>, fellow-citizens, is scourged by a war that has no parallel, perhaps, in the annals of history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>It is unparalleled in the vast extent of territory over which it spreads its pall; unparallel in the incalculable interests that are involved; unparalleled in its fate, not only upon us, but, perhaps, also, upon the whole civilized world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>Reaching every branch of industry, it fetters universal commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>Involving, as it does, the precious principles of free government, the fate of <rs n="Republican" type="political">republican</rs> liberty is suspended upon the issue. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/> Why is there such a war as this ? What have we done to the <rs>North</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>What wrong have we inflicted upon them ? Do we seek to subjugate their people by burning their houses, their villages and towns? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/> After dwelling at some length upon the objects and motives that actuate the <num value="2">two</num> parties to the war, he proceeded to urge the importance of harmony in its prosecution. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/> He especially urged the cultivation of a spirit of confidence in our rulers and generals, and of tolerance and forbearance toward apparent errors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>We are blessed with wise statesman and great generals, eminently enticed to our confidence and support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>He especially disapproved the indulgence of harsh criticism by civilians of the plans and achievements of our generals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>As a civilian, he did not feel competent to judge of military movements in remote localities, where he could not and ought not to know all the attending circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>We should stand by the <rs>Government</rs>, and sustain its policy with untiring energy and unanimity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>He did honestly believe the <name>Conscript</name> law in violation of the <rs>Constitution</rs>; but, at the same time, surrounded as we are by perils on every hand &mdash; pressed by an Herculean foe &mdash; he was willing to waive objections and yield it cheerful acquiescence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/><num value="1">One</num> of the most difficult problems of popular government is to so organize it that the minority shall possess an efficient check on the majority to restrain and prevent usurpation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>The old Constitution contains no provisions adequate for such a purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>The Southern States have been struggling against the encroachments of the <rs>North</rs> for years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/><placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> attempted to arrest this spirit in <dateStruct value="1832--"><year reg="1832">1832</year></dateStruct>; but she soon saw that it would lead to war. The tide of fanaticism rolled en, until we resolved to withdraw from the <rs>Union</rs> as a protection against it &mdash; There are but <num value="2">two</num> modes of resistance now, if we desired to resist the <name>Conscript</name> law &mdash; in which all should be willing to acquiesce--<num value="1">one</num> is nullification in the <rs>Government</rs>, which is folly, or secession from it, which is disintegration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>He would have <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> declare her solemn, dignified protest, to the end that it be not plead as a precedent in future days. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/> He counselled his countrymen against the fell spirit of party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>Let us make no war upon men, high or low, merely for opinion's sake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>The struggle requires the union of every hand, and heart, and head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>No time for party strife and personal schisms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>Be of <num value="1">one</num> mind, of <num value="1">one</num> heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>If these trials are not enough to pull us into common brotherhood, we are lost &mdash; playing a game of chance upon our mother's coffin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>He would not fail to notice the duty of making ample provision for soldiers and their families.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>He was pleased at the evidence of a disposition to meet these questions in a liberal spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>In nothing did he pride more than the tolling patriotism and hereto spirit of self sacrifice displayed by our women.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>They spin, and weave, and sew for the soldiers, while their eyes are dimmed with the tears of woe that have saddened almost every heart and desolated every hearth in the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>Those who have parental hearts know the emotions of the soldier toward those who are mindful of him and the loved ones he has left behind. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/> A good deal has been said in reference to the danger of military despotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>He had regretted to see the press giving currency, here and there, to such apprehension.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>He was proud to believe that there is no man in the <rs>Government</rs>, or in the army who has any aspirations for a crown. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/> Revolutions are dangerous to liberty, but their tendency is rather to anarchy than centralism or usurpation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>Our safeguard is in unity among our selves, and an inflexible adherence to our organic law in all its purity and integrity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>The great struggle is for a good Government; and so long as we keep that idea in view, there is no danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>Military despotism usually springs up in the midst of anarchy or the corruption of unbridled power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>With harmony and confidence in the army and Government, there is no danger of military despotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>A crown was offered to <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00046" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>, but not until the army had lost confidence in Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>We had a Washington then--<name n="God" type="God">God</name> grant that we may have a <num value="1000">thousand</num> Washingtons now. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/> How is this struggle to end ? Shall we conquer the <rs>North</rs> ? No. Shall the <rs>North</rs> conquer us?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>I say, forbid it Heaven ! When shall this struggle end ? It may be not until we <sic>are are </sic> all conquered by the chastening rod of that <num value="1">One</num> in whose hands are the destinies of nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>We have all to be chastised back into the practice of those great virtues which are the foundations of <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>The <rs>King</rs> of Heaven uses war as <num value="1">one</num> of the means of national chastlement, and we have felt it. Although our armies have been, in the main, victorious on the field of battle, yet who is there that has not been chastened!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>Scarcely <num value="1">one</num> who has not mourned the loss of some dear relative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/><num value="1000">Thousands</num> and <num value="1000">thousands</num> are weeping over the bereavement, the troubles, and harassments that surround us. This is the chastisement of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>My countrymen, he concluded, let us receive it as such, and return as humble children to the spirit and practice of those great virtues without which He has ordained that no free government can exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>Between the <rs>Northern</rs> and Southern States there was at the best of times a decided antagonism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>Though slavery formed and notwithstanding <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00047" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s emancipation proclamation, now forms no part of the issue of the war, it undoubtedly occasioned the secession of the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>That the day would come when the <rs>South</rs> would withdraw from the <rs>North</rs> was foreseen by <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00048" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, <num value="1">one</num> of the ablest <rs>Presidents</rs> the <rs>Union</rs> ever possessed; but he had the good sense to counsel a peaceful separation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>In such a secession he saw, not as at present, the disruption of the <rs>Union</rs> into <num value="2">two</num> hostile and bankrupt States, but the formation of <num value="2">two</num> distinct Confederacies, each of them inseparable in itself, and both united by the strongest of all alliances &mdash; that dictated by policy and fraternal regard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>That some of the <name>States</name> composing the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName> should acknowledge slavery, whilst others should disavow it, was incident to those principles of State independence which formed the striking feature of the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>Had the <rs>South</rs> been satisfied, or had the guarantees which it required been afforded, that the domestic institutions of the slaveholding States would not have been tampered with, or, in other words, had it been assured that the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs> would have been preserved inviolate, the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName> </p> <milestone unit="column" n="5"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/> A chief magistrate selected by chance out of the common ruck, intrusted with less authority than is granted in monarchies to a constitutional king, and invested with none of those attributes which insure for royalty obedience and respect, was utterly unfitted to conduct the destinies of a people under circumstances demanding a clear judgment and a strong will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>He travels and sleeps in an ambulance when the army is in motion, and occupies a tent when it is stationary, and not the largest and best house in the neighborhood, as is the custom of some officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>Then it was said that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> resorted to a blockade; but the blockade is an application of force allowed by the laws of nations to all belligerents. --Then the blockade was represented as being imperfect, but if it had been so, it was therefore the less injurious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>Then it was too rigorous, and prevented the export of cotton and the import of fabrics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>Is not this the lawful object of a blockade?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>Then it was <unclear></unclear> that the closing of the cotton ports by the blockade was continued too long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>We opened them to <unclear></unclear> and invited it; the insurgents refuse to <unclear></unclear> cotton be sent forward to market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>We apply all our means and energies, <unclear>dly</unclear> greater than any nation ever before applied, to suppress insurrection and restore the freedom of our inland and foreign commerce and we gain victory after victory; yet this does not satisfy our enemies abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>Defeats in their eyes prove our national incapacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>Victories won in conformity with the most humans practices of war are attended with such destruction of life as to shock and confound their sensibilities.--Complaints against an increase of duties on foreign merchandize, and against the rigor of our taxation, come upon us in the very same breath with representations that our engagements will never be fulfilled and our bonds not yet matured are advised to be forced back upon our newly filled money market for sale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>The same voices which are proclaiming to the world that the preservation of the <rs>Union</rs> is a task too expensive for the <rs>Government</rs> denounce the revenue measures adopted to secure the accomplishment of that task as hostile to foreign nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>We are a nation not chiefly of cotton-growers, but of farmers, manufacturers, and miners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/> So far as we fail we fill up the deficiency promptly by sending bread and gold.

Let the world judge whether more can be required of us. If we are not met by serious obstacles raised by foreign Powers, we shall speedily open all the channels of commerce, and free them from military embarrassments, and cotton, so much desired by all nations, will flow forth as freely as heretofore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>At the same time, the emancipation of the slaves could be effected only by Executive authority, and on the ground of military necessity.

<head>From <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> &mdash; desperate<lb/>fighting in the streets &mdash; the city<lb/>nearly destroyed.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/> The information which we have been able to obtain from the <orgName n="War Office" type="office">War Office</orgName>, as to the condition of affairs at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, is of the most meagre character, notwithstanding the well-known anxiety and interest felt by the public in relation to the important events now transpiring within our army lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>Yesterday morning a brief dispatch from the telegraphic operator at <placeName reg="Hamilton Station">Hamilton Station</placeName> was received in official circles, stating that the fighting was renewed at <time value="9am">9 o'clock, A. M.</time> at what point or with what result was not mentioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>A rumor was circulated on the streets yesterday that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00158" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Charles,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>Passengers by the evening train concur in stating that there was desperate fighting in the streets of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, in which both sides suffered severely, though the loss of the enemy was undoubtedly far greater than our own. The shelling of the town was commenced about <time value="5oclock">5 o'clock</time> on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, and continued with but little intermission throughout the day. The fire is said to have been terrific, and far more destructive than was at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> reported.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/>A gentleman, whose residence was destroyed, and who escaped from the town that night, under the cover of darkness says that not more than <num value="50">fifty</num> buildings of any value are standing, and nearly all of these are more or less damaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/>An <orgName n="Episcopal Church" type="church">Episcopal Church</orgName> and several other handsome public buildings were entirely destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>There were a number of citizens in the town at the time that the shelling commenced, among whom were women and children &mdash; These were compelled to seek shelter in the basements of their houses, until night come on, when they fled for their lives, the most of them on foot, to find a refuge within our lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/>This is justly regarded as the most unprovoked and wanton exhibition of brutality that has yet disgraced the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/> Heavy firing of artillery and musketry was heard yesterday morning in the vicinity of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> and continued up to the time of the departure of the train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>The enemy had succeeded in constructing <num value="3">three</num> pontoon bridges in the neighborhood of <placeName reg="Deep Run, Page, Virginia" key="tgn,2281284">Deep Run</placeName> and landed a force estimated at from <num value="40000">forty</num> to <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> men. These are said to have been engaged by the forces of <persName n="Cubb,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00159" reg="mostcommon:Cubb,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gens.</roleName> <surname>Cubb</surname></persName>, <persName n="Barksdale,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00160" reg="mostcommon:Barksdale,Clement,R.,,:1"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Barksdale</surname></persName> and <persName n="Kershaw,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00161" reg="mostcommon:Kershaw,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Kershaw</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>The fighting is represented to have been more of the character of heavy skirmishing than of a regular battle, in which our forces were exposed to a heavy fire from the batteries of the enemy planted upon the adjacent commanding bluffs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>Under protection of this fire the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> succeeded in effecting their landing, our forces falling back in good order, and with but little lets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>It is generally believed that the grand and decisive engagement will occur to-morrow (<dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>) </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/> P. S.--Since willing the above we learn from an official source that there was no fighting yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>This is indirect contradiction to the various reports that were given us with great confidence by several intelligent gentlemen who left the vicinity of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> yesterday morning. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>Parties from the town report that nearly the entire town is destroyed, nearly every house having been perforated by the enemy's cannonading yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>The <orgName n="Post Office" type="office">Post-Office</orgName> block was fired and burned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>The <orgName n="Virginia Bank" type="bank">Virginia Bank</orgName> and the <rs>Southern M. E. Church</rs> were also burned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>A large force of the enemy crossed last night at the town, and a severe street fight ensued &mdash; our troops retiring and leaving the place in the hands of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>There is a report that <num value="3">three</num> women were killed by the shelling yesterday, but it lacks confirmation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>It is also said that an entire infantry company of ours, on picket duty, was captured the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>No general fight is going on, but brisk infantry firing is heard in a northeasterly direction, supposed, from the sound, to be some miles below <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/> The whole of our forces are this morning to the front, and it is expected the fight will become general, before night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>Of the citizens who remained in the town, only <num value="3">three</num> stayed to claim the protection of the enemy, the others escaping last night. </p> </div4> </div3> </div2> </div1>
