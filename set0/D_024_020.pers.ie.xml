<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The differences are several. </p> 
<list type="ordered"> 
<head></head> 
<item n="1"> <num value="1">1</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>In price.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>It has been deemed best to fix this at <measure n="5d." type="currency"><num value="5">five</num> pence</measure> sterling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>This form of stating the price has been adopted in preference to cents, because it expresses the rate to be paid for the cotton here in a currency which is understood to carry a right to its value in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Thus <measure n="5d." type="currency"><num value="5">five</num> pence</measure> sterling would imply a right to receive that amount in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> or so much of our currency as would be required to purchase <measure n="5d." type="currency"><num value="5">five</num> pence</measure> sterling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>At the present rate of exchange this would amount to <measure n="25cents" type="currency">twenty-five cents</measure>. It is thought that this would not be too high a price to demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/></item> 
<item n="2"> <num value="2">2</num>. The cotton is made deliverable at certain ports, instead of any port at the option of the holder.--This change is required by the fact that most of our cotton is at the <rs>West</rs>; and if a large portion should be required at an Atlantic port, it would be impossible to perform the contract.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>It is, therefore, proposed to issue separate certificates for the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> and Atlantic ports in such amounts as can be delivered at each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/></item> 
<item n="3"> <num value="3">3</num>. The certificates are demanded only after peace, and within <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> thereafter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>It would be impossible to transport the cotton to any great amount until that period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>To provide, however, for such cases as might desire to run the blockade, it is proposed that for some premium, to be adjusted by yourself, you should place in the contract an additional clause, at follows, which you are authorized to add: <lb/> &#x0022;The Government further agrees to deliver the cotton called for militia certificate at any time during the pending war, at any port within its possession, (if practicable to transport the cotton to the port selected) upon the payment by the holder of the coat of transportation.&#x0022; </item> 
<item n="4"> <num value="4">4</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>In case, by accident or otherwise, the holder should omit to make his demand within this period, the certificate is not forfeited; but the <rs>Government</rs> has the option to deliver the cotton or return the amount paid, say <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">one thousand dollars</measure>, with interest at <num value="6">six</num> per cents from the issue of the certificate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/></item> 
<item n="5"> <num value="5">5</num>. An additional formality is added in requiring your endorsement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>This addition has been made to guard against capture or loss of the certificates on their way to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and also to give an official supervision there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>In order to have the payments put in proper form you had better deposit the certificates with our depositaries, <persName n="Frazier,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00053" reg="mostcommon:Frazier,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs</roleName> <surname>Frazier</surname></persName>, <orgName><persName n="Trenholm,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00054" reg="mostcommon:Trenholm,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Trenholm</surname></persName> &#x0026; Co.</orgName>, at <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName>, directing them to receive the money and deposit the same to the credit of the <rs>Treasurer</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>I hope that this coin will be accepted by <name>British</name> houses in payment of the rate of sterling in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, less freight and incurrence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>It seems to me that, upon its transfer to <name>British</name> owners, they could obtain transportation for it on their vessels of war from any Confederate port, inasmuch as it would be <hi rend="italics">bona fids</hi> <name>British</name> property, and in any event the holders of the transfer would have a certain security. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/> A difference has been made by our Congress in some of its appropriations for the navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>These for building vessels are payable in bonds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>It follows, therefore, that a discrimination must be made in the application of funds from the different sources of revenue, of which you will take notice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/> Under the act of Congress authorizing me to accept produce in exchange for bonds, (of which I enclose a copy,) I have procured a considerable amount, which is stored on plantations or in ware-houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>I send you a copy of <num value="1">one</num> of the certificates taken for the cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>These certificates it is proposed to offer for sale in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/> To destroy the <rs>Union</rs> and overthrow the <rs>Constitution</rs> has been the object and the design of the <name>Abolitionists</name> from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> organization of that treasonable combination. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>They commenced by assailing from <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, the existence of a domestic institution with which she had nothing to do, except, in the beginning, to profit by fastening it on the country.--They perverted the literature of that section with the foul current of their sublimated philanthropy; and flinging hat from the temple of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> the banner of the political propagandist, they silenced the mild voice of <name>Christian</name> charity, and denounced from the altar the maledictions of an embittered hatred against men of the same <name>Christian</name> denomination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>(applause.) They divided the churches into churches North and churches South, and refused to commune with Southern men. By sundering all the religious and social ties which bound the people together they carefully prepared the way for the disruption of the political ligament that united the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>They announced to the world, in the language of <persName n="Garrison,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00075" reg="mostcommon:Garrison,nomatch:0"><surname>Garrison</surname></persName>, as the cohesive principle of their party, that &#x0022;this Union is a lie!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>The <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName> is an imposture, a covenant with death, and an agreement with hell!&#x0022; Uniting themselves with the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, they won an unlimited control over its actions and principles by their zealous, vigilant, and tireless enthusiasm, and heard long hoped for promise of their triumph in the declaration of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00076" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> that &#x0022;this Union could not endue part slave and part free; that it must all become slave or all free.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/> Secession was not the necessary consequence of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00077" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s election; but his election did make it necessary to guard, by proper additional guaranteed, the rights of the <rs>South</rs> against the aggressive principles of his Abolition supporters, which he himself had condensed in such a meaning and significant expression. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/> I never recognized the right of secession, and now denounce the attempt on the part of the slave States as unjust, unconstitutional, treasonable, and sacrilegious; but I stated in the <name>Presidential</name> campaign that I was satisfied that any attempt to incorporate the policy of the radical portion of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> into the policy of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> would certainly produce most disastrous results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>The only adhesive principle of the party was animosity to an institution existing in States where that party was without an organization, and with which the <rs>Federal Government</rs> had nothing to do. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/> I believed that the election of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00078" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> would create extended alarm throughout the <rs>South</rs>, which, if not allayed in time, would result in secession, rebellion, and revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>So, thought the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>But were these results necessary?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>Could not the alarm have been relieved by measures honorable to all parties, and if it could, why was it not done? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>The Administration could have averted the war, and it did not. Why?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>It preferred the integrity of its party to the salvation of its country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>There are many good and conservative men in that party that are beginning to realize this truth, and they helped to magnify the grand triumph of the <rs>Union</rs> and the <rs>Constitution</rs> at the late elections in the great Central and Western States. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/> &#x0022;But how,&#x0022; say the people, &#x0022;shall we save the <rs>Constitution</rs> and restore the <rs>Union</rs>?&#x0022; Filled with patriotic ardor, they ask that they may act. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/> I answer by peace &mdash; peace &mdash; peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>(Applause) A peace not upon the basis of a separation, but a peace upon the basis of the <rs>Union</rs> as it was. (Immense applause.) </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/> But how shall this peace be reached?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>By a <orgName n="National Convention" type="convention">National Convention</orgName> of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>(Long continued applause.) Let the people meet in <orgName n="National Convention" type="convention">National Convention</orgName>, and there in the same spirit of forbearance and wisdom and patriotism in which our fathers framed this Government, deliberate upon the disasters which now afflict it; and I feel a deep and earnest conviction that, under the providence of Almighty <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, our country will be saved and the <orgName n="States Union" type="union">Union of the States</orgName> restored (Applause.) </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>The true enemy to this Union is now, as it ever has been from the beginning, not <hi rend="italics">slavery,</hi> but <hi rend="italics">abolitionism.</hi> Abolitionism has from the beginning denounced the <rs>Union</rs>; it refused to avert the war; it has made the <rs>Executive</rs> violate the clear and unequivocal pledges under which it enlisted the most gallant soldiery that ever want to the field; it has prosecuted this war not to enforce the laws, but to violate laws; not to maintain the <rs>Constitution</rs>, but to overthrow it; not to restore the <rs>Union</rs>, but to make its restoration impossible and its dissolution a permanent fact &mdash; not to uphold the <rs>Government</rs>, but to destroy slavery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/> This fail-spirit of mischief must die that the nation may live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>(Long, continued applause.) But, if these men, whose public conduct it directs, still press forward to realize their design of destroying the <rs>Union</rs>, it would be well that they temper the ardor of their zeal by a provident consideration of the results that will follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>The great <rs>West</rs> is made up of people gathered to it from every section of the <rs>Union</rs>, and the tendrils of whose hearts go forth to bind them in the bonds of affection with each and all of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>But if disruption must come, and some of the <name>States</name> must separate from the other, <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, falling as a debris from the grand rock of the <rs>Union</rs> would leave its proportions more harmoniously rounded than they could remain after the less of any other portion (Long, continued applause) The Union is essential to the <rs>West</rs>, and she intends to maintain it as our fathers made it with all her power and vigor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>But if her efforts in that direction are defeated, <hi rend="italics">she must look out for herself.</hi> (Applause) </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/> Having homogeneous interests with the <rs>South</rs>, she has ever seriously felt the inequality of her power in the <name>Senate</name> as compared with <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, for the <name>South</name> and <name>West</name>, upon the great question of the tariff, have acted together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>She feels how that in this war she has done all the fighting and is paying all the taxes.--(Immense applause.)

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>They would support the <rs>Government</rs> and pay its debts, not by enriching capital at the expense of labor, but by taxing capital and protecting labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>They would have, as the univocal rale of commerce throughout the world, &#x0022;<unclear></unclear> trade and sailors' rights.&#x0022; (Immense applause) In a contest on these principles, without her Southern ally, the <rs>West</rs> would exercise a power in the <rs>Government</rs> entirely disproportionate to her extent of area and her population. </p> </div4>

His propositions, while amounting to nothing, show how far the <rs>West</rs> is ahead of the <rs>East</rs> in its desire for peace: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/> He held that the cause which led to disunion was not eternal and ineradicable, and were weaker than those which tended to re-union; that slavery was not the cause, but only the development of the cause &mdash; sectionalism; that there was no irrepressible conflict between slavery and free labor, that the fundamental idea of the <rs>Constitution</rs> is the perfect and eternal compatibility of a <orgName n="States Union" type="union">Union of States</orgName>, part slave and part free; and that such a Union was the strongest of all possible Governments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>He contended that nothing kept as apart now but hate, antagonism, and revenge, and that war heats these passions <num value="7">seven</num> times hotter, and while it lasts re-union, cannot commence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>The subjugation of the <rs>South</rs> he regarded dispensable he explained the origin of the difference between <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> and the <rs>South</rs> as growing out of diversity of manners, customs, law, religion, and social habits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>But he thought that there was a large conservative, anti-<rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> sentiment in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, which would of itself overcome narrow fanaticism, and should not be excluded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/> He next held that the <rs>Middle States</rs> and the <rs>South</rs> could not separate from each other by reason of the geographical ties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>He said the <rs>Northwest</rs> would not separate from the <rs>South</rs>, and the day that saw a division between the slaveholding and non-slaveholding States would see a reparation between the <name>West</name> and <name>East</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/> The documents which we publish this morning relative to <name>French</name> intrigue in <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> will be read with the most profound interest by every man in this Confederacy who can real at all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>We do not believe, however, that the success could have been very great, or that the poison could have struck very deep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>Look at it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>When <persName n="Letcher,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00229" reg="mostcommon:Letcher,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Letcher</surname></persName> proposed that the <rs>State</rs> should undertake to supply the people, the measure encountered the histories opposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>Predictions were freely made that the result would be a great enhancement of the value of salt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>The prophets turned out to be all false prophets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>The people were supplied with salt at <num value="5">5</num> and <measure n="10cents" type="currency">10 cents</measure> per pound, notwithstanding speculators had forced the price before <persName n="Letcher,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00230" reg="mostcommon:Letcher,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Letcher</surname></persName>'s plan went into operation up to <measure n="1.25dollars" type="currency">$1.25</measure> per pound!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>These philanthropic persons, thus speculative in en indispensable necessary of life, were as a consequence, heavy losers, being forced to sell at rates below the cost of the article to them, it having come down to <num value="25">25</num> and <measure n="30cents" type="currency">30 cents</measure> per pound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>We see that the <orgName n="House of Delegates" type="government">House of Delegates</orgName> proposes a continuation of the plan, and with its beneficent effects before them the <name>Legislature</name> will no doubt re enact the law on the subject. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/> Whether the system pursued by the <rs>Government</rs> with reference to salt is applicable to other things or not, it a question difficult of solution.--But it is certain other necessaries of life are, by speculation and extortion, carried up just as far above the prices they might now be afforded at as salt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>that was held at <measure n="1.25dollars" type="currency">$1.25</measure> per pound when it was proved that it could be supplied, through all the expensive agencies of Government, at <hi rend="italics"><num value="5">five</num> and <measure n="10cents" type="currency">ten cents</measure></hi> per pound!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>The illustration is striking and conclusive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>The whole catalogue of the necessaries of life is monstrously enhanced in value by the same system of buying, holding, and extorting that was employed in salt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>Depreciation in Confederate money is made the scape goat for those who are engaged in this heartless system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>It is untrue to attribute the high prices to that cause,--It is true that Confederate money has suffered depreciation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>No paper medium not immediately convertible into gold can escape a depreciation to some extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>But that depreciation in our Government paper is not sufficient to warrant the monstrous prices for everything which not prevails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>This is proven in the case of salt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>Salt at <num value="5">five</num> and <measure n="10cents" type="currency">ten cents</measure> was paid for in Confederate money. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/> We repeat that whether or no Government interference can be extended to other things as well as salt, is a difficult question to answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>We conserve that the present Legislature is debating a proposition to restrict the formers in their production of tobacco.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>We confess that if that body undertake to regulate the crepe of the former, we should deem it simple justice that they should extend their enactments to other branches of industry and trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>We are not sanguine of beneficial results from the interference with the pursuits of the people by the <rs>Government</rs>; but its enactments should not be partial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>The world never saw a more corrupt spirit of speculation and extortion, than now exists in the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.--Our opinion is, nevertheless, that it will have to be submitted to probably until after the war. </p> </div3>
