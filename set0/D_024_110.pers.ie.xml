<head>The Situation on the <rs>Rappahannock</rs></head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> The information received from the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> to the present time is not detailed, and with respect to the present condition of the opposing forces not very definite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>It is understood that the enemy being driven from <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName>, fell back in the direction of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> ford, where he collected his forces and commenced fortifying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Our own army has command of the fords above and below him. Thus matters stand; but it may be inferred will not remain thus long. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> Soldiers engaged in the fight at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> with <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Sedgwick,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Sedgwick,nomatch:0"><surname>Sedgwick</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName>, report that after he crossed on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> several very bright fires were seen on the <rs>Falmouth</rs> shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>They were of such magnitude as to justify the supposition that immense buildings or stores were consumed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Our men were at a loss to conjecture what was the cause; but some inferred that the enemy was alarmed, under the apprehension of an advance of our forces, and were burning stores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The same evening immense lines of wagons were seen winding along, up the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>These were no doubt conveying provisions for <orgName n="army"><persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,Hartie,,,:1"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> in its new camps. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> The enemy cannot feel very comfortable in his present position, to which he has been driven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Like some hunted beast he can but feel that he enjoys a temporary respite from his pursuers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Oh! for a gunboat!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>he no doubt ejaculates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>A gunboat to a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> in such a strait is the blessedest thing on earth!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>To <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, at <persName n="Wilcox,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Wilcox,nomatch:0"><surname>Wilcox</surname></persName>'s wharf, the mailed vessels were like guardian angels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>They gave rest and sound sleep to the wounded and wearied <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, such as they had not known for many nights. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> Though our victory is important, and the results of great magnitude, it might possibly receive some additions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Everybody, however, feels entire confidence in our army and its able commander, and are convinced that whatever can be done will be done, and that in good time. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> Northern papers, noticing the crossing of their army to the south bank of the <placeName reg="Rappahannock, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1129010">Rappahannock</placeName>, are fulsome in their praises of <persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,Hartie,,,:1"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName>.&#x0022;With the reins of his command [not &#x0022;horse&#x0022;] well in hand, <persName n="Hooker,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,Hartie,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Hooker</surname></persName> rode along the entire lines, witnessing the crossing at <placeName reg="Kelley's Ford">Kelley's Ford</placeName>!&#x0022; says an enthused correspondent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The same faithful chronicler represents the march to have been taken up with &#x0022;sealed orders,&#x0022; and it was not until the crossing was successfully progressing that the seal was broken. &#x0022;Then, and not till then,&#x0022; says the writer &#x0022;he [Hooker] gave to his corps commanders the plan of the pending movement.&#x0022; Again, &#x0022;Though no proclamation has been issued to that effect, it is quite certain that the headquarters of the army is in the saddle.&#x0022; The army was &#x0022;electrified by the change.&#x0022; And thus we have letter after letter full of pompous announcements and fulsome detail such as would be found nowhere save in a Northern <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> newspaper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The pomp and circumstance of the crossing was looked upon in Yankeedom as the grand prelude to the overwhelming blow their favorite General was about to strike the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>That General had gained his position in a manner which would not have found favor anywhere but in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>He did it by defaming his brother officers, and by making a boast of his own plane in comparison with theirs, and enlarging most disgustingly upon the achievements his untried strategy would have secured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The unmilitary tyrant, and all his unmilitary subjects, were captivated by the prefigured results, and resolved to try <persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,Hartie,,,:1"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName>. --What if he was not an honorable gentleman!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/><hi rend="italics">They</hi> all knew there were a plenty of smart rascals in Yankeedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>And what if he was disgustingly boasting of his own sagacity and military tact, <hi rend="italics">they</hi> are only disgusted with defeated men, and boasting and self conceit are national characteristics of the <rs>North</rs>, and therefore not to be objected to in <persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,Hartie,,,:1"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName>] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> But <persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,Hartie,,,:1"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName> failed is a different man from <persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,Hartie,,,:1"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName> before his failure, and with all the prospective victories he had engaged to win for the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>He will now &#x0022;get his fairing&#x0022; They will all be down upon him. He has disappointed them, and all his faults and deficiencies will be magnified, and he will be the best abused man of the day. About the time of the <rs n="Battle of Fredericksburg" type="battle">battle of Fredericksburg</rs> he sighed sentimentally to a friend for relief from war, and for the enjoyment once more of his fields and herds in <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>[He never had field or herd there.] He may now indulge his pastoral tastes and go to grass himself, like another Nebuchadnezzar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> will be revenged upon <persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,Hartie,,,:1"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>For his benefit we will relate an anecdote which he may adopt with malignant satisfaction to his own case; Many years ago, when the discipline of the <orgName n="Public Guard" type="guard">public guard</orgName> in this city was very severe, a soldier who had transgressed the rules was ordered to be drummed out of town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>He was escorted to the tune of the &#x0022;Rogue's march&#x0022; to the <rs>Manchester</rs> side of <persName n="Mayo,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Mayo,nomatch:0"><surname>Mayo</surname></persName>'s bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>As his escort turned to leave him he looked after them with folded arms, and exclaimed; &#x0022;Well, if I am not fit for such a company as that, what the hell am I fit for?&#x0022; </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> This gallant and experienced officer, in whom so much confidence is placed by the people of the <rs>South</rs>, did not participate in the recent triumphs near the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Many persons, in reading <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="nearbymention:Lee,F.,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s brief dispatch announcing our victory, received the impression that he commanded the divisions attacking the enemy's front at <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>He was not present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/><num value="2">Two</num> of his divisions were there, and maintained their good fame by their intrepid and successful assaults upon the foe.--It is not an unpleasant reflection, however, that we had such men absent when such achievements were accomplished for the national reputation. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="4"> 
<head>National self-respect.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> A few years ago a number of <name>English</name> gunboats were cruising up and down the <rs type="place">Atlantic coast</rs>, chasing, boarding, visiting, and searching, often in a rude and insulting manner, every <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> merchantman that came in sight, upon the pretence of ascertaining whether she were engaged in the slave trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The right of search was <num value="1">one</num> which we had gone to war with <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> to resist, and which could never be submitted to under any circumstances, least of all under circumstances of such deliberate and want in insult as the chasing and searching of vessels on the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> coast &mdash; under the pretence that they were slavers &mdash; palpably was. The press of the whole nation raised its voice in an indignant demand that the outrageous insult should be summarily punished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>If there had been at the head of the nation a man of the <rs>Jackson</rs> stamp, he would, without any demand for explanation, have sent out a ship-of-war, with orders to fire into and sink the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gunboat that had insulted the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>It would then have been for <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> to demand explanation, and that she would not have pushed the matter to a war is evident from the fact </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> that weak and divided as the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> now are, she prefers to support her whole unemployed manufacturing population out of her private purse and by Government aid, rather than go to war with Yankeedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Or, if she had chosen war, we see by what both sections have achieved in this contest what both might have accomplished if united, and guided by Southern wisdom and energy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> But old <persName n="Buchanan,Mister,James,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="default:Buchanan,James,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>James</foreName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> was <rs type="role2">President</rs> &mdash; that weak, nerveless &#x0022;public functionary&#x0022;--and with that overweening estimate of <name>English</name> power, and disparaging idea of the resources of his own country which are chronic with a certain class of politicians and men, he lost the golden opportunity to vindicate the honor of his country and make the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> name respected throughout the world. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/> We refer to this incident now because there is too much even in our own Confederacy of this looking abroad with awe and reverence to foreign powers, and over-estimating their capacity either to help or to harm us. After every great victory we begin to inquire what will <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> or <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> say now?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Can they, after this, any longer refuse intervention?--Oh, humiliation!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>After deeds of heroism and self-sacrifice that all <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> admits have never been surpassed in the history of the world; after a fresh display of the continued interposition of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in our behalf, we begin at once to ask, What will <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> do?--It ought to be a matter of the most supreme indifference to us what they may do. We owe them nothing; they have done as much for our enemies as they have done for us; they have preserved their neutrality most rigidly; we have nothing to hope from them, and nothing to fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>We have more favors to be stow, in the long and glorious future, than we have to ask. As <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs> and <rs n="Frenchman" type="propernoun">Frenchmen</rs> we respect and honor them; we appreciate and are grateful for the sympathies of the large majority of their people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>But we owe no obligations to their Governments, and shall have none to repay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>We would have our own people cherish from the beginning of their national existence the same pride and confidence in their own country which are so eminently characteristic of the <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishman</rs>, and which have conduced in no small degree to the power and dignity of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>Such information as we have been able to gather, we lay before the reader this morning, and think we hazard nothing in saying that it approaches nearer to accuracy than any account yet published of the grand series of movements which has rolled back once more the tide of fanatical invasion, and hurled, discomfited and dismayed, across the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> the boasting hosts of the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/> As early as Thursday of last week information was received at headquarters that the enemy was crossing in force at <placeName reg="Germanna">Germanna</placeName> and <placeName reg="Banks's ford">Banks's ford</placeName>, when infantry were at once sent up to the vicinity of <placeName reg="Tabernacle Church">Tabernacle Church</placeName> to co-operate with our cavalry in that neighborhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>On <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>, at an early hour in the morning, it became apparent that the main force of the enemy had crossed at the above fords, and that his principal demonstrations were to be made from that quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Consequently all of our troops, with the exception of <orgName n="division"><persName n="Early,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="mostcommon:Early,nomatch:0"><surname>Early</surname></persName>'s division</orgName> and <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Barksdale,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00035" reg="nearbymention:Barksdale,Thomas,,,"><surname>Barksdale</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>, left the lines in front of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> and marched towards <placeName reg="Tabernacle Church">Tabernacle Church</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>On arriving at the plank road the troops were hailed, and partial line of battle formed, and reconnoitering parties and skirmishers sent in advance to ascertain the position of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>Pretty soon the guns of the skirmishers were heard, indicating the near presence of the enemy, who, however, retired, with little resistance, pursued by our own forces along the plank road, where at intervals there was heavy firing of artillery and musketry, but no general engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>That night our troops gained the summit of a ridge running nearly at right angles with the plank road, and within a mile and <num value="0.5">a half</num> of <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName>, a commanding position of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>Crossing the plank road, he assailed and carried the enemy's <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line of entrenchments by a flank movement, capturing several pieces of artillery, and a number of prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>The enemy, driven out of these retreated in the direction of <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName>, followed by our forces who had dislodged them, until they reached the top of a hill some <measure n="300yards" type="distance">three hundred yards distant</measure>, where they again offered resistance, but finding themselves too hotly pressed, soon yielded, and fell back about a mile to their <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line of rifle pits, of entrenchments, which were constructed of heavy timbers with earth thrown over them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>In approaching these works, which occurred about nightfall, our troops had to encounter almost insurmountable barriers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>The ascent for <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> was very slight, a small sluggish stream running at the foot of this ascent, between which and the works the ground was of a marshy character, covered with an undergrowth of thick shrubbery &mdash; the heavy timber around having been felled so as to form a kind of abattis, over and through which our forces had to climb. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>The works were, however, carried about <time value="8pm">8 o'clock P. M.</time>, and held for a short time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>As our troops were moving along the plank road near this point heavy volleys of musketry from ambuscades were poured upon them, and finally a battery of <num value="4">four</num> guns, posted on a hill some <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> in advance of the head of the column, opened upon them with grape and canister, fora time checking their advance and wounding a number of officers and men. The enemy then rallied and repossessed himself of the works from which he had been driven, our forces falling back a short distance during the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>On the same day a portion of the <orgName>corps of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00040" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName></orgName> gained possession of several fords on the river, in rear of the enemy. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>The line of works regained by the enemy the night previous were a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time assaulted and carried about <time value="8oclock">8 o'clock</time>. Our columns pushing on, the enemy was driven from his <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> line of breastworks, in charging which, at some points, our loss was very severe, the troops being exposed not only to a heavy discharge of musketry, but also to a terrible and destructive fire of artillery, from the ridge at <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName>, distant about half a mile, where the enemy had strongly entrenched himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>About the middle of the day, however, he was driven from this position, after desperate and criminate resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>At <num value="1">one</num> point, rather commanding, the struggle was truly desperate--<num value="3">three</num> times was the enemy driven from his position, and as often regained it; but after the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> charge of our invincible soldiery, they yielded the position without further effort to maintain it. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>Very soon the guns of the skirmishers were again heard, followed by the artillery of the enemy, directed at our columns then leaving <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>They, however, gave way without risking another general engagement, and on this end of the line the heavy fighting of the day was ended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>Nothing, beyond the events here described, has since transpired, with the exception of occasional artillery duelling. </p>
