<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> The debates in <name>Congress</name>, <name>Monday</name>, were more than usually interesting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>In the <name>Senate</name> there was, perhaps, a slight show to conservatism: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> The <num value="2">two</num> Senators from <placeName reg="Connecticut" key="tgn,7007159">Connecticut</placeName>, <persName n="Foster,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Foster,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Foster</surname></persName> and <persName n="Dixon,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Dixon,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Dixon</surname></persName>, both rather extreme <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs>, expressed their determination to let &#x0022;party slide&#x0022; in preference to endangering the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Whatever the <rs>South</rs> might demand within the limits of the <rs>Constitution</rs> they were prepared to grant, and they would also meet the question free from all party feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>They repudiated the assertion that the people of the <rs>North</rs> hated the people of the <rs>South</rs>, and did not believe that the people of the <rs>South</rs> entertained such enmity to the <rs>North</rs> as had been represented. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> <persName n="King,,Preston,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="default:King,Preston,,,"><foreName>Preston</foreName> <surname>King</surname></persName>, in reply to some questions from <persName n="Benjamin,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Benjamin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Benjamin</surname></persName>, declared that he had no fears of a dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The present excitement did not trouble him in the least.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>As to secession, he recognized no such right, and would have the <rs>Government</rs> treat a rebellious State as it would a rebellious citizen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/><persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> had settled that point to the satisfaction of the whole Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>These, with a few snarling remarks from <persName n="Sumner,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName>, accompanying a letter, which he read, of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>'s, on the subject of secession, were the evidences during the debate of an uncompromising spirit on the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/><persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> and <persName n="Brown,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="nearbymention:Brown,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, both regarded secession as a fixed fact, requiring only time for its consummation, and therefore was opposed to the resolution and to all compromises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>It was now &#x0022;too late&#x0022; was their cry, and they could not vote for a resolution looking to a compromise, when they did not believe that any could be made or would be accepted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The people hate each other in their hearts, and compromises cannot change the sentiment of the people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> In the <rs type="place">House</rs>, <persName n="Hawkins,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Hawkins,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hawkins</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, again explained his position in asking to be excused from serving on the <rs>Committee</rs> of <num value="33">Thirty-three</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> <persName n="Vallandigham,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Vallandigham,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Vallandigham</surname></persName> proposed to vote for the motion to excuse <persName n="Hawkins,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Hawkins,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hawkins</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>It is, he said, idle to attempt to coerce a gentleman to serve upon this Committee, who assigns such reasons for his refusal as the gentleman from <placeName key="tgn,7007240" n="1.000 4" reg="florida">Florida</placeName> has given; and in justice to him and his State, but above all, to the very purpose of the <rs>Committee</rs> itself, I cannot so vote.--You may decline to excuse him, but you cannot compel him to discharge with good will or alacrity the duties you impose upon him. But what kind of conciliation and compromise is that which begins by forcing a man to serve on a Committee raised for the very purpose of peace?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>What prospect, in <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> name &mdash; I speak it reverently &mdash; is there of adjustment, when you are obliged to resort to compulsion to make up your Committee on conference and adjustment?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>I pass by, without comment, the fact that with far more propriety and effect this proposition might have come from the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> in this <persName n="House,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:House,nomatch:0"><surname>House</surname></persName> &mdash; the party that has just triumphed in the election which is the culminating point of all our controversies and of the dangers which surround us. The gentleman who is the <rs>Chairman</rs> of this Committee, (<persName n="Corwin,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Corwin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Corwin</surname></persName>,) distinguished for his age, experience, eloquence and moderation, to say nothing of his position as the leader of that party, might have assumed the responsibility of taking the initiative in that great work of reconciliation, which alone can save us now, instead of allowing it to be devolved upon the representative of that particular spot in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> which abolition madness and wickedness selected as the weakest point of attack along the entire slaveholding borders of this Confederacy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> I pass by also the cumbrous construction of this Committee, with the single remark that a <orgName n="War Council" type="council">council of war</orgName> never fights, and a committee of <num value="33">thirty-three</num> never will agree upon anything &mdash; at least upon anything, not so weak, so diffused, so diluted as to be utterly inadequate to the solution of the greatest and gravest, and most material question which has ever been presented in modern history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>I will not so much as suggest the possibility that the labors of this Committee will all end in nothing, and in worse than nothing; nor will I even remark upon the peculiar composition of this Committee in having men placed upon it who represent nobody, not even themselves, or who are peculiarly odious to a majority, or a very large minority, of the sections from which they come, and thus are calculated much more to embarrass and defeat than to advance the avowed purpose for which the <rs>Committee</rs> was ordered. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> There is not <num value="1">one</num> solitary representative of the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> upon the <rs>Committee</rs> from the <num value="16">sixteen</num> free States of this Union east of the <rs type="place">Rocky Mountains</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The Pacific, indeed, is represented, but no thanks &mdash; it was <persName n="Hobson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Hobson,nomatch:0"><surname>Hobson</surname></persName>'s choice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>There is no <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> from <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName> here, although <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, by the infinite subdivision of his opponents, has managed to secure the electoral vote of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The excellent and intelligent gentleman from <placeName reg="Oregon, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007708">Oregon</placeName> (<persName n="Stout,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Stout,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stout</surname></persName>) is indeed upon it, because he is fortunate in having no colleague; although, to tell the truth, I should not have been surprised, remembering the representation of <placeName reg="Oregon" key="tgn,7007708">Oregon</placeName> in some recent political Conventions, to have seen the gentleman supported by <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName>, or possibly the member from <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, (<persName n="Thayer,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Thayer,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Thayer</surname></persName>,) though perhaps that member is a little too strongly tinctured with the doctrine of popular sovereignty to suit the times. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> In speaking of the power and geographical advantages of the great <rs>West</rs>, he said we have an empire equal in area to the whole of <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>, and we mean neither to be a dependency or a province of the <rs>East</rs> or the <rs>South</rs>, nor yet an inferior or <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> rate power upon this Continent &mdash; and if we cannot have a maritime boundary secured upon other terms, we will cleave our way to the seacoast with the sword.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>A nation of warriors we may be, but a tribe of shepherds never ! And yet nearly <num value="0.5">one-half</num> the people of this vast empire, which is very soon to play so important a part in the affairs of this continent, are utterly ignored and excluded from this Committee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>More than <num value="600000">six hundred thousand</num> voters, represented here by <num value="16">sixteen</num> members upon this floor, are silenced and disfranchised in its arrangement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>What do you propose to do without their votes at home and our votes here?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Or are we both blindly to take whatever your Committee may choose graciously to report, and be thankful for it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>We have <num value="1">one</num> State (<placeName key="tgn,7007251" n="1.000 2052" reg="illinois">Illinois</placeName>) with a Democratic majority upon this floor, and she at least had a right to be represented upon your Committee. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> The time is short &mdash; the danger is imminent &mdash; the malady deep-seated and of long standing ! Whatever is done must be done at once and thoroughly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Every remedy must go right straight to the seat of the disease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Let there be no delays &mdash; no weak inventions &mdash; no temporizing expedients.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>It is certain that he has expressed a decided opinion that the <rs>South</rs> has a constitutional right to demand the faithful execution of the <rs>Fugitive Slave Law</rs>, and that under certain circumstances he would feel it his duty not to oppose the admission of a new slave State into the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>His declaration on this point is little satisfactory to the <rs>South</rs>; but neither that declaration nor the opinion expressed by him on the subject of the <rs>Fugitive Slave Law</rs>, is at all satisfactory to the extremists of his own party. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>I do not think so.--I have every confidence that his future policy will be found to be in strict conformity with his past declarations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>But apart from this, it is now generally known that he will be powerless for mischief, except to a very limited extent, during the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> of his administration, unless the <rs>Southern Senators</rs> and Representatives elected to the next Congress should rashly, and, as I think, inexcusably resign their seats or retire from Congress, and thus voluntarily surrender the control in both Houses to the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, which surely they will not do.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/> Of the whole number of votes cast for <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00077" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> in the recent election, from my own personal knowledge, and from information received from other sources of the sentiments of the <rs>South</rs>, and especially of those of the <rs>Middle States</rs> and the <name>States</name> north of the <rs>Ohio</rs>, I am sure I hazard nothing in stating that a large number &mdash; at least <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>--are devoted to the <rs>Union</rs>, and, although opposed to slavery in the abstract, have but little sympathy with the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, and would be sincerely glad to see the slavery controversy between the <num value="2">two</num> great sections of the country speedily terminated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>They supported the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> candidate in the late election, mainly influenced by their strong and inveterate feelings of opposition to the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName>, believing that <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00078" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> was the only available candidate in the field to defeat that party. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>They joined the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> as a retaliatory measure, adopted in resentment of the repeat of the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs>, which they regarded as little less sacred and binding than the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and in further resentment of the attempt to force the <rs>Lecompton Constitution</rs> upon the people of <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>But now that they have so signally triumphed in the late election, and in view of the evils already inflicted upon the country, and the still greater evils to be apprehended, they will be content to cease the war upon Southern interests and feelings. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/> For the foregoing reasons I feel confident that the <num value="38" type="ordinal">38th</num> Congress will exhibit a falling off in the strength of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, instead of an increase. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>As to the indignity, not to say insult, offered to the <rs>South</rs>, of nominating and electing the candidates for the <num value="2">two</num> highest offices of the <rs>Government</rs> by a sectional party, on principles which practically excluded the <rs>Southern States</rs> from a voice in the election, contrary to established usage, and in violation of the spirit of the <rs>Constitution</rs> &mdash; they may be pardoned for the sake of peace and harmony, and in consideration that the <rs>South</rs> has not been guiltless of having contributed, and that in no small degree, to increase the violence and asperities of the slavery controversy between the <num value="2">two</num> sections. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/> In expressing the opinion that all grievances may be redressed in the <rs>Union</rs>, I intended to exclude other greater offences which have been apprehended from <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> domination, and which are of possible occurrence.--How they shall be redressed, should they unhappily occur, will call for new counsels; but &#x0022;sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. &#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/> The existing grievances are the obstructions interposed by some of the non-slaveholding States to the prompt and faithful execution of the <rs>Fugitive Slave Law</rs>, by what are called Personal Liberty Laws, and the refusal of the <rs>Governors</rs> of several of those States to surrender fugitives from justice from the slaveholding States in those cases in which the crime imputed to the fugitives is the abduction or stealing of slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>Some further legislation by Congress may be required to secure the surrender of such fugitives, but the due enforcement of the <rs>Fugitive Slave Law</rs> is all that is required to redress the grievances arising from the escape and abduction of slaves from the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> is armed with sufficient power and means to enforce the law in defiance of all obstructions which may be thrown in the way to defeat it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/> Viewing the subject in every light in which it can be presented, I am constrained to say that by no principle of public law, by no code of morals, by no law of earth or Heaven, would <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> or any other State be justified, under existing circumstances, in withdrawing from the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>I confidently believe that the happiest consequences would result from a Conference of all the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>I as confidently believe that a majority of the people of the <rs>North</rs> are this day prepared to agree to any fair and reasonable plan of adjustment which such a Conference of the <rs>Southern States</rs> would propose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>I purposely abstain from suggesting what, in my opinion, should be the basis of such plan of adjustment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/> After what I have written on the preceding pages of this letter, it is scarcely necessary to say that I am resolved to adhere to the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>I will not say that in <hi rend="italics">no possible contingency</hi> would I consent to a separation of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>But I would exhaust every constitutional means for the redress of our grievances before I would think of dissolving the <rs>Union</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/> I have long foreseen the probable occurrence of a crisis like the present, and shrunk from the possible issue of it; and I could never contemplate the destruction of the <rs>Union</rs> without sensations not unlike those which I imagine would overwhelm me on beholding the last going down of the sun &mdash; never to rise again forever. </p> </div3>

<head>Home industry and enterprise.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/> The increase and diversification of home industry are among the most auspicious signs of the times in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>In addition to other branches of manufacturing enterprise we have already announced the establishment of a <rs n="type foundry" type="product">Type Foundry</rs> in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and of a Sugar Refinery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>We trust that the proprietor of this establishment may meet with the encouragement which his enterprise merits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>There is nothing about it of a superficial of <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>-rate character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>Money has not been spared in the construction of the buildings, in the machinery, or anything about it requisite to the most complete order and efficiency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>The <rs n="steam engines" type="product">steam engines</rs> are of the most improved patterns, and work admirably, move powerfully and yet smoothly and without noise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>A work of no small magnitude connected with this establishment, is bringing the water used in the refinery from <placeName reg="Fulton's Spring">Fulton's Spring</placeName>, half a mile distant, through iron pipes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>This water is of the purest and clearest kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>But should more water be needed than can be supplied from the spring, a steam- pump is ready to draw it from another source.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>The filtering apparatus is an extraordinary piece of mechanism, and there are some new appliances to its efficiency which have been added by <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Morriss,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00152" reg="nearbymention:Morriss,Robert,F.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Morriss</surname></persName>.</hi> It is necessary, however, to visit the establishment in order to have any idea of its completeness and extent, The South has another important facility in this improvement in her progress towards commercial independence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/> We rejoice to chronicle such enterprises as these, both on account of the favorable indications they afford of the advance of the city in manufacturing industry, an element of prosperity and power which has contributed more than any other to the wonderful growth of most of our <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> cities, and on account of its bearing upon the ultimate deliverance of the <rs>South</rs> from the humiliating dependence upon other auctions for any article which enters into its daily use and consumption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>We suppose that, however the <rs>South</rs> may be politically divided, there can be but <num value="1">one</num> opinion among its people on the importance and value of encouraging every department of its own industry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>Whether the <rs>South</rs> will ever have commerce of its own, we cannot predict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>Whether, producing all the great staples which make up the bulk of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> commerce, the best geographical position for carrying on trade with <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and the finest rivers and harbors on the continent, it will always remain without ships and seamen, and without efforts and aspirations for any, it is impossible to foretell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>But there are no obstacles in the way of manufacturing enterprise to daunt the most timid and irresolute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>On the contrary, the advantages in climate, water-power, coal iron, and all the elements of manufacturing success, are so abundant and palpable, that the future success of manufacturing industry in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> is placed beyond the shadow of a doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>Let us hope that all Southern men, of all shades of party opinion, will unite upon a platform which has nothing to do with politics, but is eminently practical and substantial; a platform which every other section and every other State in the <rs>Union</rs> stands upon &mdash; that of Home Industry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>It is this spirit of self-dependence which has made the <rs>North</rs> prosperous and powerful, and which none can object to except those who think that loyalty to others demands that we should be false to ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>We do not invoke the <rs>South</rs> to cast off its commercial and manufacturing vassalage to the <rs>North</rs> in a spirit of anger or retaliation, but simply as a policy which it owes to its own prosperity and energy to adopt, which duty to <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, which has endowed it with such capabilities of greatness, requires, and which duty to posterity solemnly demands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>Every State in the <rs>Union</rs> considers it wise and proper to advance its own interests, and free itself from dependence on other States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>New York snatched the commercial sceptre from <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> and <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>; <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> have rivalled <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> in many branches of manufacturing, and none of them ever send to other States for an article which they can produce within their own borders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>Why does not the <rs>South</rs> follow this wise example ? Why rest contented until she manufactures every article which she uses, and transports her own productions to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and brings the goods which she requires, in her own ships?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>This should be the common ambition of all parties in the <rs>South</rs>, and no beginnings, however small, should be despised, but on the contrary encouraged and fostered, which tend to that result. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>The budget for <date value="1860">1860,</date> which cannot appear till next year, will naturally contain the details of the increased receipts and expenditures caused by the extension of the city to the fortifications, under the working of the law of <date value="1859-06">June, 1859</date>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>It appears by the present document that the receipts for the past year have amounted to about <num value="110000000">110 millions</num> of francs, whist the expenditure has reached the sum of <num value="98000000">98 millions</num>. <num value="1">One</num> of the principal sources of the receipts is, as usual, the <hi rend="italics">octopi,</hi> or tax on eatables and drinkables, combustibles and other objects entering the city gates, which figure in the above account to the amount of <num value="54000000">54 millions</num> of francs, an increase on the last <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> of nearly <num value="21000000">21 millions</num> in this single branch of revenue. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>Of the <num value="54000000">54,000,000</num> thus obtained, the drinkables contribute <num value="27000000">27,000,000</num>, being <num value="3000000">3,000,000</num> more than in the previous year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>It is remarked that the immense extension given in the last <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> to the building trade, has caused a rise of from <num value="1000000">1,000,000</num> hectoliters of lime and plaster to <num value="20000000">20,000,000</num> of the same materials.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/> The consumption of butchers' meat has considerably increased since the trade has been thrown open, there being an increase of <num value="7000000">7,000,000</num> of kilos (or <num value="14000000">14,000,000</num> of pounds) within the last <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>. Among the other receipts the dog tax is computed to bring into the city nearly <num value="300000">300,000</num> francs, whilst the diminution in the canine race has been reckoned at no less than from <num value="42000">42,000</num> in <date value="1855">1855</date> to <num value="29000">29,000</num> in the year <dateStruct value="1859--"><year reg="1859">1859</year></dateStruct>.
