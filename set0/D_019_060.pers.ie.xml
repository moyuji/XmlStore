<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The question of peace or war seems to have been settled in Cabinet to-day in favor of the former, after a stormy session, in which <persName n="Chase,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Chase,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName> urged the integrity of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> as paramount to every other consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Something with respect to the troops at <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> had to be done, and that without delay, as official information received yesterday left no doubt that <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> could not hold his position over <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure> longer without additional supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Thus the issue was forced upon the new Administration &mdash; reinforcement or withdrawal of the garrison.--The Cabinet met at <time value="11oclock">eleven o'clock</time> and discussed the question until <time value="2pm">two P.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The decision has been received by the radical <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> with great disapprobation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>He seemed evidently easy, and conversed with more than his usual vivacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>It is well known that <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Robert,,,"><roleName n="Major">Maj.</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> cannot now be reinforced, without imminent danger of a serious collision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/><num value="2">Two</num> steamers, of light draft, with supplies of men and provisions, have been in readiness for some time, to make the attempt whenever ordered, under the command of an officer who is willing to take the risk, and feels confident of success; but the military preparations in and outside of the harbor of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> render any such experiment hazardous, unless sustained by a heavy naval force, which could be used now, as the main ship channel is entirely clear of obstructions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The Cabinet had a special session of over <measure n="3hours" type="date">three hours</measure> last night, in which the policy concerning <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> was fully discussed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>An informal conference was also held this morning, at which several members were present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>No decision has yet been reached, but the general opinion prevails to-night that the troops will be withdrawn. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> This condition of things was purposely contrived by <persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Holt,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Holt,Peter,C.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Holt</surname></persName> declares openly that the present Administration can in no way be made responsible for any course that may now be adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>He says that the fort could have been reinforced <measure n="30days" type="date">thirty days</measure> ago without serious difficulty, and measures had been taken for that purpose, but <persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> positively refused to have them executed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>His whole policy was to bequeath a complication to his successor which compelled <num value="1">one</num> of <num value="2">two</num> alternatives, either withdrawal, or reinforcement with the certainty of civil war. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The people will be prepared, if this withdrawal of troops takes place, for a yell of exultation from every traitor in the land, for taunts and swelling self-congratulations from the men who have labored more earnestly than any others for the destruction of the <rs>Union</rs>, by crying out for concessions and compromises; but let all remember, that the strength has not yet departed from our flag, and that this movement may be only as the crouch which is to precede the decisive leap.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>No matter if the treason which has woven around us its toils compels a step which no <num value="1">one</num> wishes to take; no matter if rebellion seems to have advanced its banners, or if treason turns more confidently toward us its brazen front, the policy of the <rs>Government</rs> remains unchanged, and its firm foot is just as immovable as ever on the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the laws. </p> </q><bibl n="Tribune"></bibl></cit>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> In case the predicted event happens, the people will place on the proper heads the responsibility of the act. They will follow the late <rs type="role" reg="President">President</rs> to his retirement with a sharper indignation than they have before felt; they will, moreover, ask with an earnestness which call for a reply, why the repeated assurances went forth from the beleaguered fort that the commanding officer needed no aid, no supplies; they will demand from all who have borne a part in the transactions of the past <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> with relation to this important place, a strict account of their stewardship. --They will, nevertheless, renew their confidence in the power they have set over them at the <rs>National Capital</rs>, and will by that confidence strengthen the hands of the <name>Administration</name> for vigorous action in the future and forward. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>Allegiance here is that which is due from a citizen to a sovereign power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>He knew of no sovereign except that of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>But that is because of the fact, not because of the allegation, for the <rs>Constitution</rs> says that a foreigner shall not have a seat on this floor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>The <rs>Senator</rs> from <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> said he believed he was a foreigner to this Government because <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> has separated herself from it, for the <rs>Senator</rs> did not then know the fact, nor did he know it now, unless he received the intelligence last night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>I found that when the matter was under discussion with the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Government the opinion of <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Clarendon</foreName></persName> seems to have been unfavorable to the proposal that private property at sea should be respected during war. No final decision was come to, and no official communication was made, and the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Government expressed a wish that all communications upon the subject should be suspended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>Some time afterwards <persName n="Dallas,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00125" reg="mostcommon:Dallas,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Dallas</surname></persName> read to me a dispatch of considerable length and much ability, which was addressed to <persName n="Mason,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00126" reg="mostcommon:Mason,Samuel,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Mason</surname></persName>, at <placeName reg="Paris, Bourbon, Kentucky" key="tgn,2040685">Paris</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>In that dispatch it was stated by the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Government that it was impossible that private property on board belligerent vessels should be respected at sea; but <persName n="Cass,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00127" reg="mostcommon:Cass,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Cass</surname></persName> added that he considered that the right of blockade, as authorized by the law of nations, was a great abuse; that the only case in which a blockade ought to be permitted was when a land army was besieging a fortified place, and a fleet was employed to blockade it on the other side; but that any attempt to interrupt trade by a blockade, or to blockade places which were commercial ports, was an abuse which ought not to be permitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>That, of course, opened a still wider question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>My answer to that dispatch was simply that, as the war had ceased, and the treaty of <placeName reg="Paris, Bourbon, Kentucky" key="tgn,2040685">Paris</placeName> had been concluded, it was not advisable to continue that discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>The proposition itself seems to me to be <num value="1">one</num> of the utmost magnitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>It is in fact, a proposal that, there being <num value="2">two</num> Powers, <num value="1">one</num> of which has a very strong army and a strong navy, the other having an army inferior in numbers, but a superior navy, the <name>Power</name> which has the superior navy should forego all the advantage to be derived from that source, and allow the contest to be decided by military force alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>[Hear hear.] Its adoption would in the next place tend rather to prolong than shorten wars, because <num value="1">one</num> way in which a great maritime power can act as a belligerent is to cripple the trade of its opponent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>The greater its strength as a maritime Power, the greater its power to do this, and the better its chance of bringing the war to a favorable termination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>If this proposition were accepted, the whole of the power would be gone which has hitherto rendered <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> so formidable at sea. -- [Hear, hear.] In the next place, I perceive difficulties in detail which would be insurmountable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>The mercantile navy of a belligerent would be free from capture, but no <num value="1">one</num> could say when a number of vessels, apparently merchant ships, appeared off the coast that they might not be used for purposes of war, and that they did not contain.-- </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>The vote of the <rs>Virginia Commissioners</rs> was cast as a unit against that section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/>He alluded to the opinion of <persName n="Brockenbrough,Judge,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00330" reg="mostcommon:Brockenbrough,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Brockenbrough</surname></persName>, that an article prohibiting forever the foreign slave trade was unnecessary, because provided for in the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>While that instrument contains no inhibition of the trade itself, it confers powers upon Congress, and Congress had made it piracy, and therefore there was no necessity for further provision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>The construction placed upon the provision by himself was, that it applied to the foreign <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slave trade; and the law would no more apply to <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, as a foreign slave country, than at the present time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>After an elaborate argument upon this point, he alluded to the veto of the <rs>Southern President</rs> upon the bill against the foreign slave trade. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Summers,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00332" reg="nearbymention:Summers,George,W.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Summers</surname></persName></hi> replied, that he cast no reflection upon the motives or the action of the seceded States, however much he might regret it. He had no further information than what he had seen in the newspapers, and supposed the motive of the <rs>Southern President</rs> was to leave the matter as it was under the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> law, or to reduce the penalty for engaging in the <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slave trade to a misdemeanor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/> On the provision relating to compensation for the loss of slaves, out of the public treasury of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, he commented at length.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/>It was based upon the ground of the failure of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> to execute the law. It was the duty of the <rs>Government</rs> to execute the law, and if it failed, the loss should be made good to the master of the slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>The fact that Government would be thus bound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/>would act as a stimulus for the execution of the law. The object was to remove all subjects of agitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>If Government were permitted to levy upon States, cities and counties to reimburse itself, there would be constant agitation in the communities where the suits were instituted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>He thought it was a matter of doubtful expediency to arm the <rs>Government</rs> with such power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>The proper plan, he conceived, was to so arrange the matter as to compel the <rs>Government</rs> to execute its own laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>It would give a stimulus to the growth of slave property, particularly in <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>He was a <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginian</rs>, and indulged in no sectional sentiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>His affection extended not to his own section alone, but to the whole State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>It would be equally beneficial to <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>The provision would protect and encourage the growth of slave property throughout <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Tyler,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00333" reg="nearbymention:Tyler,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Tyler</surname></persName></hi> desired to make an inquiry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>According to his recollection, the vote of the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName>, in the <name>Conference</name>, was given as a unit against that (the <num value="7" type="ordinal">7th</num>) section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>He asked him if he would reverse the picture and state the objections which he had to it in the <name>Conference</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Summers,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00334" reg="nearbymention:Summers,George,W.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Summers</surname></persName></hi> said he hardly dared attempt a picture which his honorable colleague could to much more successfully draw.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>He had not, however, considered the whole section; only that part relating to the payment for slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>In regard to the remainder, which says Congress shall provide by law for securing to the citizens of each State the privileges and immunities of the several States, he proceeded to give his views.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>A member of the <rs>Pennsylvania</rs> delegation had suggested this affix in the <orgName n="Peace Congress" type="congress">Peace Congress</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>The argument in its favor had been to protect Northern men from violence in the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>Of course the <rs>Southern Commissioners</rs> all voted against it. They thought it unnecessary.--He went on to speak of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> now dominant in the <rs>Northern States</rs>, and said it consisted of <num value="2">two</num> wings, differing very widely on prominent questions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>The clause was not offered with the expectation of Southern support, but was offered by the concentrated portion of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> with a view, if possible, to entrap some of the more patriotic members from the <rs>Border States</rs> by leading them to suppose they were thus carrying out a provision of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>He thought, however, that no Southern man voted for it. An objection now urged was that free negroes might at some time be declared citizens, and thus made to come within the purview of the provision.--In this connection he alluded to the <rs>Dred Scott</rs> decision, where it was held by a large majority of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> that negroes were not citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>When the time shall come that the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></orgName> shall declare that free negroes are on an equality with white citizens, there will be no Government worth preserving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>The innate sense of the people would prevent such a declaration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>He believed, however, that the cutting off of this affix would not make the provisions of the proposition less acceptable to the <rs>North</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/> He alluded to the proposition before the <rs>Convention</rs> for a <orgName n="Border Slave States conference" type="conference">Conference of the Border Slave States</orgName>, at <placeName reg="Frankfort, Franklin, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013939">Frankfort</placeName>, in <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>He concurred in the measure, and thought the <orgName n="Peace Conference" type="conference">Peace Conference</orgName> propositions should be brought before it as <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>'s contribution, with the affix excised therefrom. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/> In speaking of the advantages gained by <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> in the propositions, he supplied an omission in his remarks on yesterday, by stating that <placeName reg="Arizona" key="tgn,7006451">Arizona</placeName> had been declared part and parcel of <placeName reg="New Mexico" key="tgn,7007565">New Mexico</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>The guarantees, as a whole, were, in his opinion, infinitely greater than <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> could have expected to obtain a year ago. But it had been said that the whole effort had proved abortive, in consequence of the failure of Congress to take cognizance of the measures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>He gave a history of the proceedings initiating the <name>Conference</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>The time had been short, and the notice in some degree insufficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>Yet there were <num value="21">21</num> States assembled by their Commissioners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>After a labor of some <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> this adjustment was agreed upon; and it reached the halls of Congress only <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> before the close of the session, when there was a <sic>fulness</sic> of business, rendering it impracticable to take up any new measures for consideration; and at a time, too, when <num value="1">one</num> administration was going out of power, and a new <num value="1">one</num> coming in. Congress, <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> too, was composed of members elected <measure n="2years" type="date">2 years</measure> ago, upon issues adverse to any change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>But notwithstanding all these adverse circumstances, a motion to take up in the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> was carried by a large majority, but not by a <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> vote, which was necessary to suspend the rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>In the <name>Senate</name>, the proposition was destroyed by the mingling of gentlemen of extreme opinions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/><name>North</name> and <name>South</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>He would say, that whatever might be the opinion here, the constituent body were not prepared to say that the time for settlement was past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>There had been no time so auspicious for settlement as the present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>The <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">Institution of slavery</orgName> had never before so many friends as at this moment.--These systems of free and slave labor were not only without principles of conflict with each other, but absolutely necessary as reciprocal systems.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>Distinguished Northern men in the <name>Conference</name> had assured him that the propositions would be accepted by their people by large majorities if submitted to a vote, especially in communities heretofore rampant against slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>He called the attention of the <rs>Convention</rs> to the action in the late Congress, in submitting an amendment to the <rs>Constitution</rs>, by a <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> vote, effectually closing the door to future interference with slavery in States where it exists.--He also adverted to a law passed by the same Congress, in reference to the rendition of fugitives, illustrating his argument by the case pending between <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>To meet that case, and others of like character, Congress passed a law for the surrender of a fugitive on the demand of a State Executive, where the <rs>District Judge</rs> is satisfied of the identity of the party charged, and that he was in the <rs>State</rs> whence the demand comes at the time the offence was committed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>He looked upon these things as evidence that there was everything to encourage efforts for a settlement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/><placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> had duties to perform to and for herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>He was not unmindful of the desire to bring back the seceded States; but he was ready to declare that whatever guarantees were formed satisfactory to the border slave States, ought, <hi rend="italics">a fortiori,</hi> to be satisfactory to States further South.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>The border slave States were infinitely more interested in the slavery and territorial questions than were the <rs>Cotton States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>Those gallant States were entitled to our affection, and he was not prepared to admit that, when all these questions were settled to the satisfaction of the border States, those sisters would refuse their assent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>He gave a brilliant perspective view of re-union, and believed that in time they would return to us. What was <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> to gain by secession and separate action?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>Nothing on the <name>Territorial</name> question, but lose everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>On the fugitive slave question she could make no treaties with the <rs>North</rs> or with <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>In relation to the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>, which he considered morally, socially and politically right, she would lose her present protection, and be exposed to border incursions from a foreign government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>He spoke in this connection of the beautiful <placeName reg="Kanawha Valley">valley of the Kanawha</placeName>, which he in part represented, and its great wealth of mineral deposits; and asked what was to be the condition of that portion of the <rs>State</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>He protested on behalf of his constituents against a change of the present status.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>They wanted peace and security.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>If cut off and dismembered from the <rs>Union</rs> they would be plunged into a condition of helplessness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>They would become the &#x0022;outside row in the cornfield,&#x0022; to use a homely expression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>Slavery would be destroyed, and <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> come to be regarded as no better than a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> appendage, by her sister States of the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/> He went on to speak of invasion from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, of which we had been hitherto under no apprehension.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>If the <rs>Union</rs> is divided, no measure of safety could be adopted, except through a large standing army on each side of the line. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/> Where, he asked, would be the wisdom of passing an ordinance of secession, in the face of the known sentiments of a Virginia constituency?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>The people did not mean to adopt such an ordinance until every honorable measure of adjustment had been exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>Go on, then, with the efforts; and when all fail, the people of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> will be united from <num value="1">one</num> end to the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>He expressed his devoted attachment to <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, for whose interest he was willing to lay down his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>But he was here to speak his mind fully and frankly, and, for <num value="1">one</num>, he protested against the passage of an ordinance of secession He spoke of the action and position of the <rs>Border States</rs>, and then alluded to the new Administration, and to the argument that <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> was thereby to be driven out of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>He denied that she could be driven or impelled by anybody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>Instead of our submitting to <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00335" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, he was at this moment submitting to the action of the <rs>Border States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>He cared nothing about the <name>Inaugural</name>; <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00336" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> could not retake the forts, if he so desired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>He did not need them, for they were in seceded States, and not necessary to national defence; and in any event he had not the means of raising a force for their capture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>The idea of collecting revenue outside of the harbors he pronounced illegal and impracticable; and the proposition for a blockade could not be maintained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>He did not propose to discuss the right of secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>No enlightened statesmanship could compare the secession of States, by conventional majority, with insurrectionary movements in former times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>It was a new and unlooked for condition of things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>He was in favor of letting the seceded States alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>The latest news gave encouragement to the hope that the troops would soon be withdrawn from <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, and time would bring back the <name>States</name> into the common family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>It was the duty of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> to stand by the <rs>Union</rs> until the performance of that duty became impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>He urged the adoption of the proposition for a conference of the slave States remaining in the <rs>Union</rs>, with an endorsement of the <orgName n="Peace Conference" type="conference">Peace Conference</orgName> propositions as the basis of adjustment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/><placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 5" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> ought to act promptly, but not precipitately; <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> she should command the peace on all sides; next, call the <orgName n="Border State Conference" type="conference">Border State Conference</orgName>, and adjourn over to a wait its result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>She ought to remove the existing state of business depression, by letting her voice go forth that she knows her duty and means to perform it; that she means to keep the peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>Do it, and however dark and cheerless it may have been, the bow of promise will span the whole heavens, and the voice of the people will everywhere come up, saying &#x0022;well done, thou good and faithful servant.&#x0022; </p>
