<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> Conflicting reports of this affair were in circulation yesterday, but the foregoing statement is derived from a source entitled to full confidence, and may be relied on as correct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>It has been conjectured that this advance of the enemy's cavalry was made with a design to destroy a train of cars which had been running from <placeName key="tgn,2111971" n="1.000 34" reg="gordonsville, orange, virginia">Gordonsville</placeName> to <placeName reg="Orange, Virginia" key="tgn,7014299">Orange Court-House</placeName>, but in this they met with a signal failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>We understand that our pickets were driven in previous to the fight, and that <num value="1">one</num> man was killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>This may have given rise to the report that our men were forced to retire before over whelming numbers, and that the enemy took possession of <placeName reg="Orange, Virginia" key="tgn,7014299">Orange Court-House</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> A gentleman direct from <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> informs us that before leaving he saw in a Baltimore paper, of <date value="07-31">July 31st,</date> an allusion to a rumor that a member of the <rs>British Legation</rs> received a letter from <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Lyons</foreName></persName> by the last steamer communicating the intelligence that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> had been recognized by the <rs>British Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Very little confidence was placed in the truth of this rumor, but the decided tone of the latest <name>English</name> newspapers had occasioned apprehensions at the <rs>North</rs> that recognition, if not a fact accomplished, was an event not far distant. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>From the same source we learn that recruiting for the <orgName n="U. S. Army" type="org">United States army</orgName> is <q>&#x0022;an up-hill business&#x0022;</q> in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>With all the efforts that had been made, and pathetic appeals through the war newspapers, not more than <num value="20">twenty</num> men had enlisted in <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> up to the <date value="07-26">26th of July.</date> There seems to be a pervading consciousness that the <rs>State</rs>'s quota cannot be raised without resort to a draft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Yet it is feared that this step cannot be taken without danger to the abolition cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Some of these men say that they have been deceived &mdash; that they didn't enlist to fight for niggers; but the majority declare that they have seen enough of the elephant and are tired of the war. They occasionally offer their revolvers for sale to the citizens at a low price, and our informant purchased a very fine <persName n="Colt,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Colt,nomatch:0"><surname>Colt</surname></persName>'s pistol of <num value="1">one</num> of them for <measure n="3dollars" type="currency">three dollars</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>He mentioned the circumstance, but they stoutly denied all knowledge of it; they had never been in that neighborhood before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The gentleman then called his <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> overseer and asked him if he had ever seen these individuals, and could remember any incident in connection with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/> The effect of this intelligence upon the public mind at New York is marked, and we cannot but think unmistakable.
