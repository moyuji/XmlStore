<head>A British cotton route through <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName><lb/>recommended.<lb/>[from the <orgName n="London Post" type="newspaper">London post</orgName>, (Government organ,)<lb/><date value="06-28">June 28.</date>]</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> On the <dateStruct value="--21"><day reg="2">21st</day></dateStruct> of last month an act was passed by the <orgName n="Southern States Congress" type="congress">Congress of the Southern States</orgName> at <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName>, prohibiting, under heavy penalties, the exportation of cotton or of <rs n="cotton yarn" type="product">cotton yarn</rs>, <q>&#x0022;except through the seaports of the said <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.&#x0022;</q> And this prohibition is to continue so long as any of the ports of the <rs>South</rs> are blockaded by the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The object of this act clearly is to retaliate upon the <rs>Northern States</rs>, by preventing them from obtaining for their manufactures a supply of the raw material overland.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>It would appear, therefore, that for the present all commerce in <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> cotton is effectually cut off. The blockade of the <rs>Southern</rs> posts by the navy of the <rs>North</rs> on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, and the strict prohibition against the inland traffic on the other, must entirely shut up at least the ordinary channels of traffic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>But there is a clause in the recent act passed by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> which indicates that a new outlet may be found in the present crisis for the great staple of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The provision to which we refer is in the following words: <q>&#x0022;Nothing in this act shall be so construed as to prohibit exportation to <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> through its conterminous frontier.&#x0022;</q></p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> Now, as the <rs>Northern States</rs> are at peace with <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, they cannot of course interfere with any exports that may be shipped from that country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Still less can they blockade any <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> port.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The question of the practicability of establishing a transit for cotton across the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> frontier <hi rend="italics">is, therefore, <num value="1">one</num> of very great importance, and more especially to ourselves.</hi> We may remember that during the <rs>Russian</rs> war a traffic of a similar kind was established with great success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Although all direct intercourse with <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName> was prohibited, the produce of that country found its way overland to the ports of <placeName key="tgn,7016786" n="1.000 94" reg="prussia">Prussia</placeName>, and was thence shipped, without let or hindrance, to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The land traffic had, no doubt, the effect both of raising the price and diminishing the quantity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>But we deemed it better to submit to this inconvenience than to the still greater inconvenience of being deprived of <persName n="Russian,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Russian,nomatch:0"><surname>Russian</surname></persName> produce altogether.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The truth is, the more commercial the world grows, the more difficult does it become to enforce the laws of war regarding trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The spirit of these laws is so essentially opposed to the spirit of commerce that we need not be surprised at this, nor at the various attempts which have been made of recent years by different commercial bodies, both in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> and in <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>, to overturn the ancient doctrines upon this subject, <hi rend="italics">and to introduce an entirely new maritime code.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> Whether or not the contemplated cotton traffic through <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> is likely to succeed, we are not prepared to say. <placeName key="tgn,1018380" n="1.000 4" reg="tampico,tamaulipas,mexico,north and central america">Tampico</placeName>, we believe, is the nearest port to the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> frontier, and the route from thence through <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> to the mouth of the <placeName key="tgn,7022231" n="1.000 1584" reg="mississippi river">Mississippi</placeName> is long and difficult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>But we know that in <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName>, cotton is still brought from the interior of the country by the most primitive modes of conveyance; and in the event of a protracted struggle in <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName> we have no doubt that a portion of the produce of the <rs>Southern States</rs> will find its way to <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> ports, and from thence in neutral bottoms to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>It is astonishing to what channels commerce will adapt itself when its ordinary course is interrupted <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> could march in triumph from the <rs>Tagus</rs> to the <name>Vistula</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>He overthrew, as if by magic, the best appointed armies and the most ancient dynasties in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>He could make and unmake what laws he choose, excepting only <num value="1">one</num>--the simple and eternal law of demand and supply. </p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/> The last Proclamation of the <rs>Governor</rs>, dispensing with the call of the militia for actual service, where <num value="0.1">ten per cent</num> of the white population has volunteered, meets every demand of justice and necessity, and should be actively supported by the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>We are confident in the belief that a very large and effective volunteer force will in this manner be at once sent into camp. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/> The present moment certainly appeals with peculiar eloquence and power to the patriotic spirit of our people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>Our arms are victorious before repeated assaults of the enemy, and nothing is wanting but additional numbers to enable our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> to precipitate their commands upon the enemy's lines before <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and drive both his army and Government from that city. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/> A strong volunteer force, immediately, rallied would vastly facilitate this enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>Those volunteer companies which are <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> organized will have the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> chance to be supplied with the arms which have been picked up in such large numbers upon the field of battle before <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>Those volunteer forces which should not be able to procure such arms would be at once placed in the charge of our breastworks and batteries; and would thus leave our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> free to move their whole present force forward against the enemy's lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>Undisciplined men, even with inferior arms, are capable of manning breastworks and serving artillery as successfully as the most veteran troops; and it is for this reason that our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> are so eager to procure <hi rend="italics">men</hi> at this particular juncture, no matter how little they may be drilled or how slightly armed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/> The present call for volunteers, or, if these cannot be procured in the desired numbers, for militia, is intended to meet this particular position of affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/><num value="8">Eight</num> or <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> new troops, no matter how raw, thrown into our breastworks, and placed in charge of our artillery, would make everything secure in our strongholds, and would mobilize the whole of our well drilled forces for operations in the field against the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>The new troops need not be afraid of being put to work upon entrenchments, for these have been completed; and even if further fortifications should be needed, they could be completed much more speedily by throwing the whole force of the army upon them, than by wasting time by employing only a small portion of the force. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/> The occasion is therefore the most admirable <num value="1">one</num> for volunteering that has occurred during the war. The <orgName type="regiment" key="1Company">first companies</orgName> will be certain to be armed with the best guns in either service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>All the companies will at once be put forward in places where they are sure to see heavy fighting, and where they will enjoy the protection of field works at the same time that they may have the opportunity of dealing destruction upon the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>Their opportunities for learning the drill and becoming acquainted with the discipline and art of camp life, will be better than has been yet enjoyed by troops newly organized; and they will learn war on its largest and most active scale by immediate participation in it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/> We trust that the rally of volunteers under the <num value="0.1">ten per cent.</num> requisition will be prompt and enthusiastic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>The country needs their services to make good its designs against the enemy.--We are tired of awaiting attacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>We desire, for this purpose, to mobilize the whole of our present force, and to supply their places in the fortified camps with the new forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/><num value="6">Six</num>, <num value="7">seven</num> or <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> of these sent at once into our camps would be worth as much in the way of reinforcements as the same number of regulars and veterans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>They would disengage for service in the field against the enemy the whole of our present army, and drive the invaders at once from the soil of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>All alarm and apprehension would cease within our own borders, and panic would be carried into the country of the enemy. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>A <num value="7" type="ordinal">seventh</num> had been burnt at sea. This <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName> was in other times a mail steamer, plying between <placeName reg="La Habana, Ciudad de la Habana, Cuba" key="tgn,7006453">Havana</placeName> and New Orleans, with the title <rs>Havana</rs>; but seized by the rebel Government, she was converted into a man-of-war, and well armed and manned, put to sea the other day from New Orleans, in saucy defiance of what the journals of that city properly describe as the paper blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>The news of her departure has Barely reached us when it is hotly pursued by this latter news of her success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>It is true the insular authorities have reclaimed the <num value="6">six</num> prizes, because they had been captured within Spanish waters; but the fact of seizure shows the power for mischief possessed by the cruiser in question, and renders it almost certain that if any of these released vessels hereafter depart for their ports of destination in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, they will be exposed to serious danger of recapture and condemnation.
