<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/> The attitude in which the parties whose names stand at the head of this article present themselves before the world on the important question now agitating the country is eminently proper, as well as highly instructive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>Victorious every where, it is but natural that he should entertain no vindictive feelings towards those over whom he has triumphed in war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>If there was to be any vengeance, he would have avenged himself on the spot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>He would not have sneaked off under the plea of indisposition to shed human blood, and then attempted to gratify his revenge, when he found it safe to do so, by proscribing <num value="1000000">millions</num> of men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/> The influence of the <orgName n="Christian Church" type="church">Christian Church</orgName> on slavery in ancient times has been <num value="1">one</num> of the most interesting subjects of theological discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>There are those who maintain that the <name>Scriptures</name> directly oppose slavery &mdash; a theory which is plainly contradictory to hundreds of passages in the <rs>Old</rs> and New Testaments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>There are others who insist as boldly that the <name>Scriptures</name> not only sanction, but enjoin slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>Neither of these positions seems to be warranted by that interpretation of Scripture which is found in the faith and practice of the <orgName n="Christian Church" type="church">Christian Church</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>A brief statement of the position which the <rs type="place">Church</rs> has occupied from the beginning may not be without interest to those who desire to know what are the real relations of religion to slavery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/> It must be premised that slavery existed in ancient times, not only under the <rs n="Jewish" type="religion">Jewish</rs> dispensation, when it had at least the sanction of the <name>Divine</name> Law-giver, for a time, but in almost every country of the ancient world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>It not only existed, but there was an accredited error, somewhat akin to that which has been reproduced in late years, that slaves were an inferior race, degraded by their Creator himself, marked by a stamp of humiliation, and predestines to their <sic>state</sic>of abjection and debasement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/><hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Homer,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00177" reg="mostcommon:Homer,nomatch:0"><surname>Homer</surname></persName>, <persName n="Plato,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00178" reg="mostcommon:Plato,nomatch:0"><surname>Plato</surname></persName></hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><foreName>Aristotle</foreName></persName></hi> distinctly taught this doctrine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>All readers of history are well aware of the excessive rigor and cruelty with which slaves were treated in ancient times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>Even the right of life and death, which was then placed in the master's hands, was often exercised. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/> The slavery of ancient times was not only cruel, but immense beyond our conception, prevailing everywhere, and so deeply rooted in laws, manners, ideas and interests, individuals social, that its immediate eradication might have convulsed the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>Such was the state of things which Christianity found upon the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>Inspired by the ennobling impulses of humanity, and upheld by the courage which springs from the consciousness of strength, the <rs type="place">Church</rs> could not be indifferent to any of the evils, whether small or great, under which humanity greened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>War, Despotism and Slavery were then, as they always had been, the chief scourge of the human race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>Whilst the <name>Founder</name> of Christianity declared that His kingdom was not of this world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>His teachings deposited grams in the heart of society which, developed by time, must ultimately effect the removal of injustice, oppression and violence from the face of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>Whilst, in regard to Christianity, it is impossible to prove that the New Testament proclaimed freedom to the slave &mdash; for that would have been to convulse the world &mdash; its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> words, nevertheless, declare that those men, whom ancient philosophers had <unclear>pre</unclear> born to obey, are equal to all men in be dignity of nature, and in the participation <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> of the graces which the <rs>Divine Spirit</rs> diffuse upon earth. &#x0022;For in <num value="1">one</num> spirit were we all baptized in <num value="1">one</num> body, whether Jew or Gentile, whether bond or free.&#x0022; &#x0022;There is neither Jew nor Gentile; there is neither bond nor free; there is neither male nor female.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>For you are all <num value="1">one</num> in Christ Jesus.&#x0022; Wherever <name>Christian</name> doctrines prevailed, slaves, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, learned that, though they were unfortunate; though birth, poverty, or the reverses of war, had condemned them to misfortune, they were at least acknowledged as men and brethren, and that between them and their masters there was a reciprocity of rights and obligations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>This was the germ which Christianity deposited of the ultimate enfranchisement of enslaved mankind. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/> Now, it is true, a class of texts may be found which seem to conflict with those we have quoted, but, as expounded by learned theologians, perfectly harmonize.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>It was natural that the passages already mentioned should be misunderstood and exaggerated, and it was to guard against this that Christianity exhorted servants to obey their masters, not as pleasing men, but as the servants of <persName n="Christ,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00179" reg="mostcommon:Christ,nomatch:0"><surname>Christ</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>It had also, by its doctrines of peace, forgiveness and justice, prepared the way for the ultimate extinction of war and despotism, but the process in each and all must be necessarily gradual; and in the meantime it defined the duties of soldiers, and enjoined subjects to honor and obey their <persName n="King,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00180" reg="mostcommon:King,nomatch:0"><surname>King</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/> It is matter of history that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> efforts of the <orgName n="Christian Church" type="church">Christian Church</orgName> were directed to the mitigation of the cruel treatment of slaves and the improvement of their condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>The canons, decrees and other documents which show the solicitude of the <rs type="place">Church</rs> on this subject would of themselves fill a volume.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>A perusal of them will refute the prevalent idea that the extinction of serfdom in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> was accomplished by the force of interests, primarily, and not of ideas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>Christianity made itself master of ideas and manners, communicated to them a new impulse, and gave them a different direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>The whole process, however, was, in the nature of things, gradual; the rigor of slave laws became relaxed, their observance was neglected, their equity doubted, their expediency questioned, until at length the institution crumbled to its downfall. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/> Slow and protracted, however, as was the movement, a great number of the slaves did not know the value of liberty, did not conduct themselves, in their new state, according to the dictates of reason; and while they enjoyed the rights, did not know how to fulfill the obligations of freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>Not less prominent than her influence in producing emancipation were the efforts of the <rs type="place">Church</rs> to secure the work she had accomplished, and to impart to the freemen that education and morality which are essential to the proper appreciation of their new condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>There is no brighter record in the annals of <name>Christian</name> civilization than the manner in which the <rs type="place">Church</rs> triumphed over these inconveniences and difficulties, inseparable from the nature of things. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/> These reflections are not without interest in our present condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>The beneficent impulses and energies of Christianity have been brilliantly exhibited in the moral and physical elevation of the <rs>Southern</rs> slave under the slave institutions, now abolished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>It would be impossible to find in the past ages any example of bondmen who received, with few exceptions, such humane and considerate treatment, and the hardships of whose lot were alleviated by so many sympathies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>Their rapid multiplication proved their physical comforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>In health and manhood they were rarely over-worked; in infancy, sickness and old age, they were provided for and relieved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>That their spiritual interests were not neglected is evident from the fact, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> stated by <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Styles,Reverend-Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00181" reg="mostcommon:Styles,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Reverend-Doctor">Rev.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>It cannot be doubted that the men who exhibited this practical benevolence to their former bondmen will prove their best friends, now that they are free, and will labor to exalt their moral condition, and to make them feel, by practical sympathy and <name>Christian</name> charity, that we desire their welfare and improvement. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>He ran to him, and found that he was dead, and the blood and brains were oozing out of a bullet wound in the head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>The unfortunate deceased must have applied the pistol, to his right temple; and the ball lodged in the brain, causing instant death.
