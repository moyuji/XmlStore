<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>It is plainly and palpably the intense greed for gain, the passion for wealth, the servile and idolatrous worship of the <rs>Almighty Dollar</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>Throughout all lands the name of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> and the thing <placeName reg="Mammon">Mammon</placeName> worship are in inseparably associated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>It is needless to discuss the question whether the reputation of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> for being the most avaricious and extortionate of man kind be well deserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>We know there are noble exceptions to it, but, on the whole, it cannot be denied that their intense eagerness for the acquisition of money has never been surpassed, and that it is this, above all other evil traits, which, long before the <rs>Union</rs> was dissolved, gave the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> an evil name in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>The Southern character, whatever its shortcomings, was never in better days addicted to the vice of covetousness.
