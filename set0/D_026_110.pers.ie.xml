<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/> The grand <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">army of Northern Virginia</orgName>, under its illustrious leader, performed prodigies of valor, and covered itself with new glory in the battles of <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>It has driven the enemy at all points, and valued important advantages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>With all his superiority of numbers &mdash; no doubt immense &mdash; he has been forced to give way before the intrepid soldiers of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and to seek the consolation and protection to be afforded by the spade, since his favorite comforter, the gunboat, under which he has so often cowered from our troops, cannot come to his assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>According to the report of our reliable correspondent his situation is &#x0022;precarious.&#x0022; We have not a doubt of it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>Frightened Rumor has made it large enough, <name n="God" type="God">God</name> knows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>Vigilance, readiness; coolness, and resolution, are the qualities demanded by the times; and we are sure our citizens, who have so much at stake, and who have proved their loyalty so signally, need not a word of admonition to stimulate them to duty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/> As to whether it is likely the enemy will press his advance by the river upon <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> it might be reasonably inferred that the crippling and humiliation of the main part of the movement against the <rs>Confederate</rs> capital would deter the leaders of the auxiliary land and water expedition by the <rs>James</rs>, single handed, from the hopeless task.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>We should not be surprised to hear of its retreat the way it came in a very few hours. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/> Nevertheless there will be no relaxation of watchfulness and energy by the authorities who direct the military movements in this and the adjoining district until they are gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>Though he has oft learned this lesson, it may be conjectured that in the present campaign he will receive an impression that will be enduring. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/> In the news column of our paper will be found all the intelligence we have touching the important pending campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>It will be seen that another disaster is added for the discomfiture of the enemy on the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>We announced on Saturday the &#x0022;handsome affair&#x0022; of the blowing up of <num value="1">one</num> of his boats by a torpedo, and the &#x0022;sending without notice to their long account&#x0022; (a fate the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> philanthropists are shocked at) all on board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>We now learn that a body of &#x0022;horse-marines&#x0022; compelled the crew and officers of the <rs>Suwanee</rs> gunboat to surrender, and the boat being set on fire by a shot the wounded perished in her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>They do more &mdash; they seriously affect the enemy.
