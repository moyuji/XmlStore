<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>The <num value="2">two</num> side doors of the cabinet were closed and locked &mdash; also by the <name>Messrs</name>.

Then the centre door was pushed to, and in less than a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> it was bolted upon the inside and the trumpet thrown violently out of the hole in the door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>The committee rushed to the closet, the lights were turned up, and there sat the <name>Davenports</name>, bound as before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>The astonishment of the audience may be imagined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>Those who were skeptics a moment ago now began to doubt their own conclusions, and joined in the general applause. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/> The manifestations then followed in the regular order, the audience remaining very quiet and watching everything critically and intelligently.--The committee seemed to be extremely impartial, and briefly reported the results of their examinations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>A full chorus of instruments playing a jig was heard inside the closet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>The doors were hastily opened, and the <name>Davenports</name> had not moved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>Spectral hands and arms appeared at the closet window.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>The doors were opened, and the <name>Davenports</name> were still bound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>While the doors were partly open the instruments were flung out, and a hand was seen to strike Fire <persName n="Baker,Marshal,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00106" reg="mostcommon:Baker,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Marshal">Marshal</roleName> <surname>Baker</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>Still the <name>Davenports</name> were tied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>Then, the doors being closed for <measure n="3minutes" type="date">three minutes</measure>, the brothers were discovered perfectly unbound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>In <measure n="4minutes" type="date">four minutes</measure> more they were bound again, better than the committee could have bound them, as these gentlemen candidly acknowledged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>Then <persName n="Baker,Judge,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00107" reg="mostcommon:Baker,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Baker</surname></persName> entered the closet and sat between the <name>Davenports</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>The doors were shut; the manifestations continued; and, when the lights were again turned up, the <rs>Judge</rs> was revealed with a tambourine on his head, and reported that the <name>Davenports</name> had not moved a muscle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>The Fire <rs type="role2">Marshal</rs> then tried the same experiment and made the same report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>All of the manifestations were repeated several times, to satisfy the most distrustful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>It was especially noted that in every case the inside bolt of the centre door was heard to shoot into its socket in less than a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> after the door was closed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>This destroyed the theory that the <name>Davenports</name> untie themselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/> By way of finale <persName n="Lacy,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00108" reg="mostcommon:Lacy,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lacy</surname></persName> suggested that wheat flour should be placed in the hands of the <name>Messrs</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>This was accordingly done by the committee, and any of the flour that had fallen within the box during the operation was neatly brushed away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>The doors were then closed for the last time, and still the manifestations continued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>Noises were heard; an open hand was shown at the window, and the trumpet was thrown out. The doors were opened and there stood the <name>Davenport</name> brothers, unbound and holding the wheat flour in their hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>The committee failed to find any of the flour about the closet or upon the clothes of the <name>Davenports</name>, and yet they could not have avoided spilling some of it had they unclosed their hands ever so little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>For such wonders, and for those performed by <persName n="Fay,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00110" reg="mostcommon:Fay,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Fay</surname></persName> in the room above, the hypothesis of legerdemain or jugglery does not seem a reasonable explanation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>No modern juggler has ever performed such deceptions, if they are deceptions, and during the many years that the <name>Davenports</name> have appeared in public, no <num value="1">one</num>--not even the <rs>Professors</rs> of <orgName n="Harvard College" type="college">Harvard College</orgName>--has detected them in their &#x0022;impositions,&#x0022; as some people call the manifestations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>The <rs>Davenports</rs>, although they are spiritualists, we believe, do not announce that these phenomena are spiritual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>They simply produce the manifestations, and ask others to explain them, reserving their own theory, whatever it may be, as their private property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>In regard to the term &#x0022;humbug,&#x0022; which is often applied to these exhibitions, it is enough to say that there is no humbug in what the audience see, and no apparent attempt at humbug on the part of the performers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>The wonders are undoubtedly worth witnessing, and well worth the money required to purchase a ticket of admission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>After a critical examination of the phenomena, therefore, we are inclined to believe that the greatest humbugs about them are the explanations and exposes given by &#x0022;medical students&#x0022; and other such gentry, who think they can clear up in a single night the mysteries which have puzzled wiser men for years. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/> This is gratifying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>It is cheering to the people to see that the public interests are to be cared for, no matter how high the storm of war rages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>We trust that the &#x0022;conscript fathers&#x0022; will adhere to this temper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>We would be glad to see them vote a perpetual session for them and their successors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>We have no fancy for the motto, &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">Inter arma silent leges.</hi>&#x0022; In our Government it should not obtain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>The law-making power is always demanded by the public exigency, and should be ever at hand to meet the demands upon it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/> In the spirit of devotion to the public welfare, even at a time like this, we are gratified to see them attending to the abstruse question of finance, which requires calmness and deliberation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>The Senate have passed a bill on the subject that is worthy of general approval.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>It directs that the <name>Treasury</name> notes in circulation shall be reduced to <num value="200000000">two hundred millions</num> on the <dateStruct value="-01-1"><day reg="1">first</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct> next or as soon thereafter as practicable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>Previous to that time it limits the amount of Treasury notes to be issued under the act to which it is an amendment to <measure n="1dollars" type="currency">one dollar</measure> of new to <measure n="3dollars" type="currency">three dollars</measure> of the old currency, reserving, however, the authority to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> to issue new notes in exchange for old held by individuals at the rate of <num value="2">two</num> of new for <num value="3">three</num> of old.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>The States having claims against the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> are authorized to receive half in new issue of Treasury notes and the other half either in <num value="0.06">six per cent</num>, bonds or in these untaxable <num value="4">four</num> per cents., as they may elect. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/> The holders of old notes, entitled to exchange for new, are authorized to invest them in these untaxable <num value="4">four</num> per cents at the rate of <measure n="2dollars" type="currency">two dollars</measure> of bonds for <num value="3">three</num> of treasury notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>And it is provided further that persons holding the <num value="0.04">four per cent</num>, bonds or the <name>Treasury</name> notes issued under the act of the last session, &#x0022;to reduce the currency, and to authorize the new issue of bonds,&#x0022; may invest them in the new untaxable <num value="4">four</num> per cents authorized by this act at the rate of <measure n="2dollars" type="currency">two dollars</measure> of bonds for <measure n="3dollars" type="currency">three dollars</measure> of the <num value="4">four</num> per cents or the <name>Treasury</name> notes, (new,) This privilege, however, terminates on the <dateStruct value="-01-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct> next. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/> The bill further provides that the <num value="4">four</num> per cents and bonds issued under the act of the last session shall be receivable in all dues to the <rs>Government</rs> until the <dateStruct value="-01-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct> next, except export and import duties. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/> The bill, we anticipate, will readily pass the <rs type="place">House</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>Its provisions are proper, and will help still further to improve the credit and the currency of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>We hope that the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> will be able to reduce the currency, as prescribed by the bill, to <num value="200000000">two hundred millions</num> by the <dateStruct value="-01-1"><day reg="1">1st</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct> next.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>But the <rs>Congress</rs> will meet before that day, and may afford such facilities to the accomplishment of its own mandate as may be necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>We take it that the bill is an expression of the determination of Congress on the subject, as well as the desire of the people, and it is to be hoped it will be carried out successfully. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>The gates were hoisted, the floods came, and dashed against our bulwarks with all their power, and were resisted and repelled!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>A few days dissipated all the calculations of the boastful nation that had concentrated its mighty resources for the final overthrow of the <rs>South</rs>.
