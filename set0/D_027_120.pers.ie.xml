<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>There was nothing of importance done on the lines before <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The bombardment of <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> gap was kept up in fine style, and the booming of the guns was heard distinctly in our streets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>There is a general impression, gathered chiefly from hints dropped by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> press, that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> is preparing for the final grand movement of the campaign in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, which it is confidently hoped by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> people is to end the war by taking <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Constant and repeated failure seeming to have no effect upon him, we know of no reason why he should not make another attempt to dislodge our army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>His experience on the south side should satisfy him there is nothing to be hoped from an advance in that quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>He may argue that, if he could throw <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 2">two corps</orgName> on the <rs>Williamsburg</rs> and <measure n="9Mile" type="distance">Nine-Mile</measure> roads at the points essayed by the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 18">Eighteenth corps</orgName> on the <dateStruct value="--27"><day reg="27">27th ultimo</day></dateStruct>, he might effect a lodgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>It is said he is already mustering his forces for the fray, and deserters report that he has been reinforced by a portion of <unclear>Sherida </unclear> command from the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>; but this we shall not implicitly credit until it comes to us through some less questionable channel. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/> The only official information received by the press yesterday was that <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> had destroyed the <rs>Northwestern</rs> and <rs>Atlantic</rs> railroad from <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7015966" n="1.000 12" reg="altoona, blair, pennsylvania">Altoona</placeName>, the <rs type="place">Chattahoochee bridge</rs> included.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>This movement is difficult to understand, except as explained by unofficial reports that were in circulation during yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>If they be true, the destruction of the railroad can be understood, though it will still appear a superfluous labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The reports had it that <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, having burnt <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> on the <dateStruct value="--15"><day reg="2">15th</day></dateStruct>, last <dateStruct><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct>, had set out for <placeName reg="Macon, Bibb, Georgia" key="tgn,7013980">Macon</placeName> with <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 3">three corps</orgName>, amounting together to <num value="35000">thirty-five thousand</num> men, and that he had, on yesterday, reached <placeName reg="Jonesboro, Clayton, Georgia" key="tgn,2023284">Jonesboro</placeName>', <placeName><distance reg="22miles">twenty-two miles</distance> <offset>south</offset> of  <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName></placeName>.--If there is truth in these accounts, as we believe there is, <persName n="Wheeler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Wheeler,nomatch:0"><surname>Wheeler</surname></persName> has much to answer for. It devolved upon him to watch <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> and keep posted as to his movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Only <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure> ago he reported him &#x0022;moving towards <placeName reg="Bridgeport, Fairfield, Connecticut" key="tgn,7013453">Bridgeport</placeName>.&#x0022; Now, it is said, he reports him moving towards <placeName reg="Macon, Bibb, Georgia" key="tgn,7013980">Macon</placeName>, as above stated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>We regret to say this latter report is corroborated by other evidence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> will, we think, meet with opposition he does not calculate upon before he reaches the fortifications of <placeName reg="Macon, Bibb, Georgia" key="tgn,7013980">Macon</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>These works, should he ever reach them, he will find of the most formidable character, and with the troops that before that time will be collected in them, they must give him a vast deal more trouble than he evidently counts upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>If the <name>Georgians</name> will battle for their trenches as the <rs>Petersburg</rs> militia did last <dateStruct value="-06-"><month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct> for theirs, or the <rs>Richmond</rs> militia did at <placeName reg="Staunton River, Madison, Virginia" key="tgn,2692308">Staunton river</placeName> bridge, later in the summer, <placeName reg="Macon, Bibb, Georgia" key="tgn,7013980">Macon</placeName> will be saved. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> In undertaking this expedition, <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> is too prudent a man to rely upon subsisting his army on the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>It becomes interesting and important to consider what point he calculates upon making his base of supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>His destruction <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> of the railroad northwest of <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> proves that he has cut loose from the <rs>Chattanooga</rs> base.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>He must, then, be looking to some point on the <rs>Atlantic</rs> or the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>We are disposed, for several reasons, to believe that <placeName reg="Pensacola, Escambia, Florida" key="tgn,7013972">Pensacola</placeName> is the selected point; this, not because of its greater proximity than any other post to his present field of operations, but because it is ascertained that for more than a month very large supplies have been accumulated there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>If he fail to take <placeName reg="Macon, Bibb, Georgia" key="tgn,7013980">Macon</placeName> at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> dash, he will probably run for <placeName reg="Pensacola, Escambia, Florida" key="tgn,7013972">Pensacola</placeName>, and make it a new base of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>It is not to be presumed that he carries with him supplies sufficient to enable him to enter upon a siege which shall occupy any considerable length of time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/> We have ventured the opinion that <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> had <placeName reg="Pensacola, Escambia, Florida" key="tgn,7013972">Pensacola</placeName> in view as a new base of supplies; but it is proper to say there are reasons why he might select some point on the <rs>Atlantic</rs> as being nearer at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/><placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, for instance, offers advantages, did its approach not involve the certainty of a great deal of heavy fighting. </p>
