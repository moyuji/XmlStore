<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/> We have already published the proceedings of the <rs>Confederate Board</rs> of Impressment Commissioners which have just adjourned at <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta, Ga.</placeName> The subject of its deliberations is of such vital interest to the country that we give in full the report of the committee upon &#x0022;the interpretation of the act,&#x0022; which is for the guidance of impressment officers throughout the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>The committee report: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/> That they have considered the subject matter referred to them, and are of opinion that the phraseology of the law itself defines with the greatest accuracy the cases in which the owners of property impressed by the <rs>Government</rs> agents are entitled to have the value thereof determined by local assessment or arbitration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>The law provides, in explicit terms, that in cases where property of the owner impressed by the <rs>Government</rs> and the impressing officer cannot agree upon the value thereof, it shall be the duty of such impressing officer &#x0022;upon an affidavit in writing of the owner of such property or his agent that such property was grown raised, or produced by said owner, or is held or has been purchased by him, not for sale or speculation, but for his own base and consumption, to cause the same to be ascertained and determined&#x0022; by the process designated in the foregoing resolution as &#x0022;local assessment.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/> The enumeration of the cases in which the owners of property impressed are entitled to the benefit of local arbitration, it is believed, includes every conceivable case but the <num value="1">one</num> in which the owner cannot, or will not, prove by his own affidavit, or that of his agent, that such property was grown, raised, or produced by him, or is held, or has been purchased by him, not for sale or consumption, but for his own use or consumption.--The intention of the law, it in most manifest, was to make those who purchased for trade or speculation <num value="1">one</num> class, and all other persons another class; this latter class, however, may in practice be augmented by the refusal of persons intended to be embraced in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class to make the affidavit in the <orgName type="regiment" key="1Section">first section</orgName> of the law specified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>Those who make this affidavit are entitled to have the value of their property, or what will be a just compensation therefore, determined by local arbitration &mdash; all other persons can only demand for their compensation according to the schedule of prices agreed upon and published by the <rs>Commissioners</rs> in pursuance of <orgName type="regiment" key="5Section">5th section</orgName> of the impressment Act. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/> The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> question referred to the committee for its consideration is stated in these terms: &#x0022;And when an appeal is made to the <rs>Commissioners</rs>, whether it is not their duty to affirm the award of the local arbitrators as being just compensation, if the impressing officer cannot furnish evidence to the contrary.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/> The act of Congress concerning impressments was passed as well for the protection of the citizen as for that of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>The rights of the citizen were so often violated by the arbitrary and unjust proceedings of Government agents charged with the duty of furnishing supplies for our armies that a public clamor was raised upon this subject, which reaching the ears of Congress, led to the introduction and enactment of the original Impressment law. In the original law no provision is made for appeals from the decision or the award of the local arbitration for which the <orgName type="regiment" key="1Section">first section</orgName> of the act provides; but this decision or award was declared to be final, as the schedule prices agreed upon and published by the <rs>Commissioner</rs> were made final in all cases to which they were <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> applicable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>Soon after the passage of the original act, however, in the immediate vicinity of Congress a ease occurred in which, by local arbitration, <measure n="20dollars" type="currency">twenty dollars</measure> per <num value="100">hundred</num> weight was allowed by a farmer for day, when the owner of the article had offered it to the agent of the <rs>Government</rs> for less than half that price. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/> This occurrence was made public notoriety, and immediately led to the passage of the act by Congress entitled &#x0022;An act to amend an act entitled &#x0027;An act to regulate impressments by officers of the army.&#x0027;&#x0022; This act declares that in all cases of appraisement provided for in said act, the officers impressing the property shall, if he believes the appraisement to be fair and just, endorse upon it his reasons for refusing, and deliver the same, with a receipt for the property impressed, to the owner, his agent, or attorney, and as soon as practicable forward a copy of the receipt and appraisement, and his endorsement thereon, to the <name>Board</name> of Appraisers appointed by the <rs>President</rs> and Governor of the <rs>State</rs>, who shall revise the same, and make final valuation, so as to give just compensation for the property taken, which valuation shall he paid by the proper department.&#x0022; From this brief history of this appellate jurisdiction of the <orgName n="Commissioners Board" type="board">Board of Commissioners</orgName>, it will be seen that it was conferred alone for the protection of the <rs>Government</rs>; and this is even yet more strongly manifested by the fact that the right of appeal is denied to the citizen, whist it is given as a right to the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>To this appeal on the part of the <rs>Government</rs>, the only condition president is that the officer impressing shall endorse upon the appraisement his reasons for disapproving, and thereupon the case comes before the <name>Board</name> of Appraisers for their revision and final valuation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>This appellate jurisdiction was obviously given to the <rs>Commissioners</rs> as a remedial measure. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/> The law conferring it is therefore a remedial law, and upon well-settled principles of construction should be construed in the light of the evil which led to its enactment, and so as to suppress the mischief and advance the remedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>Now, to do this it must be held that the powers of the <orgName n="Commissioners Board" type="board">Board of Commissioners</orgName> in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction are to be held as unrestricted and general as are their powers in cases of which they have original jurisdiction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>It is the duty of the <rs>Commissioners</rs> to fix upon the prices to be paid by the <rs>Government</rs> for every article of property which can become the subject of a local arbitration, and this they are required to do so as to afford just compensation to the owners thereof, and these prices, it is insisted, should be regarded as fair and right until by competent proof the contrary is shown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>To illustrate, the <rs>Commissioners</rs> are required to fix the price to be paid by the Government-say for the article of wheat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>The Commissioners of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> in the discharge of this duty agree upon and publish <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">five dollars</measure> per bushel as the price to be paid for wheat in the city of <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName>; this, then, is the judgment of the <rs>Commissioners</rs> as to the value of wheat in this place, and as to the price that will afford just compensation therefore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>At this price the <rs>Government</rs> agents in <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName> impress and appropriate large quantities of wheat for the use of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>They make an impressment, however, and the owner of the wheat so impressed makes the affidavit which will entitle him to the benefit of an appraisement by local arbitration. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/> This appraisement, is made and <measure n="8dollars" type="currency">eight dollars</measure> per bushel is allowed; this case is now brought before the <rs>Commissioners</rs> by appeal, and it now becomes their duty to revise the said local arbitration and make final valuation of the wheat in question so as to give just compensation therefore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>In making this final valuation, it will be seen, they will only be required to decide a question which they have previously solemnly adjudicated, and upon which their judgments are known to be fully made up. Now, under these circumstances, shall it be said that judgment of the inferior jurisdiction shall be regarded as <hi rend="italics">prima facie</hi> right, though in conflict with the judgment and decision of the appellate jurisdiction, or should not the very reverse of this be held to be the sound rule upon the subject?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>What is just compensation to <num value="1">one</num> citizen in <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName> for his wheat will, also, as a general rule, be just compensation to his neighbor for the same article, and surely in the absence of all proof authorizing or requiring a difference to be made, it can scarcely be expected that a <orgName n="Commissioners Board" type="board">Board of Commissioners</orgName> will say to <num value="1">one</num> citizen of <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName> that <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">five dollars</measure> per bushel is the full value and just compensation for his wheat, and at the very same time, because his neighbor's case comes before him by appeal, declare that the latter is entitled to <measure n="8dollars" type="currency">eight dollars</measure> per bushel, and that less will not be just compensation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/> It is obvious that it was intended that the original impressment Act, and the law by which it was amended, were to be construed as <num value="1">one</num> law, and thereby introduce, as far as practicable in each State uniformly of prices; it must also have been intended that the <rs>Commissioners</rs>, in assessing vaines, should, in their original and appellate jurisdiction, adopt and apply the same principles and standard, and, this being done, it will follow that in all eases brought before the board by appeal, schedule prices must be enforced, unless the owner of the pressed testimony make out an exceptional case, in which event it would be competent and proper for a higher price to be allowed; but, in considering appeals, it should be borne in mind that the assessment of local arbitrators is not by the law made testimony, and should not, there fore, when above the schedule prices, be regarded as <hi rend="italics">prima facis</hi> right, but as erroneous, unless by competent proof the contrary is shown. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/> If the <rs>North</rs>, instead of having a vast numerical preponderance and an immense superiority of all kinds of resources, were only our equals in all these advantages, we should even then be shamefully derelict to our duties and responsibilities if we imperiled such momentous trusts as those committed to our hands by the neglect of any of those military precautions which are essential to the success of our arms and the safety of our country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>But when we have everything to contend against &mdash; when we have a foe who can bring <num value="3">three</num> soldiers into the field to our <num value="1">one</num>, and bring against us at every point the heaviest odds of material and munitions of war &mdash; it is obvious that nothing can save us from destruction but the most unlimbering vigilance and the sternest and most all-pervading discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>We must make up in these qualities what we lack in numbers, and cease to place an absurd dependence upon the superiority of our individual courage; for, in war, more depends upon discipline than upon courage, and if we allow our enemy to surpass us not only in numbers, but in watchfulness and energy, we shall insure our defeat and annihilation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>Even in fighting qualities we ought to know by this time that discipline can convert the <rs>Northern</rs> masses into <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> rate fighting machines, and that the only way to counteract its effects is by equal or superior discipline on our side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>We are afraid that there is too much disposition to esteem lightly the prowess and enterprise of the enemy, to go to sleep in the neighborhood of a wily and energetic foe, and to abstain from enforcing the penalties of breaches of discipline upon all, high and low, who neglect their duty.--The time has come when we must do this thing, or be overrun by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>The time has come when the armies of the <rs>South</rs> must be armies of regulars, and every officer and every man be held to as strict account for the performance of his duties as the officers and men of the regular armies of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>The magnificent courage of the <rs>Southern</rs> troops can only be put to valuable account by making their discipline equal to their courage, and by husbanding our resources in men and arms with the most patient forethought and the most perfect system. </p>
