<head>The armies below <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> Very little is known of the relative positions of the <rs>Confederate</rs> and Federal forces below <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>There has been no operations of a startling character, and the impression generally obtains that there is no immediate probability of an encounter between the <num value="2">two</num> armies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>There was a rumor yesterday to the effect that the enemy's main force had evacuated the position recently held by them at <placeName reg="Berkeley, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002254">Berkeley</placeName>, and moved on down the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>This is probably true, and although the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> has no authentic intelligence of the fact, it is generally conceded that probabilities tend to confirm the report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>It is much more likely that he will, <unclear></unclear> permitted to do so, withdraw his army from the swamps and marshes of <placeName reg="Charles City, Charles City, Virginia" key="tgn,2111055">Charles City</placeName>, where unhealthy malaria and climatic influences would rather tend to decimate than to reorganize his shattered regiments, to some point nearer the coast where the health of his troops and the convenience of the service would be consulted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>From any stand point there does no seem to be any ground to apprehend that the <rs>Southern Capital</rs> will again be menaced for some time to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>In the mean time no <num value="1">one</num> doubts that our army will be placed upon the most effective footing, ready not only to repel the invader, but to carry the war to their own homes. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>It appears that the party was sent up to capture a wagon load of bacon and burn a lighter; but on arriving at the landing the vessel could not be found, and her owner remarked that he had sent her down the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The <rs>Lieutenant</rs> in command of the marauders then went into a store to procure some tobacco, and while there discovered a gun, which he attempted to seize.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The owner resisted and shot the officer, who was not probably injured as to prevent him from mounting his horse and leaving the premises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Meanwhile some citizens outside got into a fight with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> soldiers, <num value="1">one</num> of whom was killed, and the others field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The whole party of <num value="8">eight</num> finally surrendered, and were brought to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/> The rebels having cut my telegraph wires, I found it necessary to invent a new system of signals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>I therefore adopted the old idea of signaling by lights; so I made bonfires out of a few <num value="1000000">million</num> of dollars worth of commissary and quartermaster stores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Finding that the rebels <rs>Jackson</rs> and <rs>Hill</rs> were close behind me, I tore up the bridge at <placeName reg="White Oak, North Carolina, United States" key="tgn,1131760">White Oak river</placeName> and resolved to give them battle at long taw. This is a popular mode of fighting with my men, when their long-range guns are out of reach of the balls of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>But, while we were having a fine time at our favorite game at <placeName reg="White Oak, North Carolina, United States" key="tgn,1131760">White Oak river</placeName>, the everlasting <rs>Longstreet</rs> and <persName n="Hill,,A.,P.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00038" reg="default:Hill,A.,P.,,"><foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName> struck me in flank and killed and captured a great number of my men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>I therefore fell back and tolled the rebels on.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>It was a glorious victory; but I could not persuade our men that it was a glorious victory <hi rend="italics">for them.</hi> I therefore yielded to the wishes of my heroic boys and resolved to toll the rebels on.--When the belligerents at <placeName reg="Sebastopol, Scott, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057451">Sebastopol</placeName> gained a brilliant battle they held the field; my abandonment of <placeName key="tgn,2489910" n="1.000 10" reg="Malvin Hill, Pulaski, Kentucky">Malvin Hill</placeName> was, therefore, different from anything done at <placeName reg="Sebastopol, Scott, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057451">Sebastopol</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/> At <time value="1oclock">one o'clock</time> the rebels came up in solid phalanxes and pressed forward towards the guns, supported by column after column, as far as the eye could reach, and presenting <num value="1">one</num> of the most fearful as well as interesting sights imaginable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>For some miles around, with the exception of a point on the left, the country is almost entirely clear of forest, and <num value="1">one</num> of the largest and most beautiful estates extend, over which the eye sweeps at pleasure. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/> The fearful havoc of the rapidly-bursting shells, from guns so ranged as to sweep any position far and near, and in any direction, was terrible to be hold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>The burning sun, which had poured down its terrible heat during the previous <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> and up to noon, had become over-clouded, and the day was comparatively cool.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>Still the dust and smoke partially concealed the dreadful carnage. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/> The enemy's guns were by no means without their effect upon our side, and the dead and wounded were literally covering the field, while as the enemy advanced nearer and nearer, the old dwelling turned into a hospital was immediately under fire; still the surgeons and nurses never flinched, and the stretchers and ambulances came in with their loads of wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>As the enemy approached, <orgName n="division"><persName n="Morell,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00054" reg="mostcommon:Morell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Morell</surname></persName>'s division</orgName> met them, received their distant fire, and, advancing, poured in volley after volley while the several pieces of artillery directed to this point threw canister and grape, and, as it were, mowed them down by battalions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>The enemy could not bear it, and our troops fought against a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> relief of fresh troops in several instances, and then charging, drove them from the field.

At the right a most desperate effort was made to divide the army and penetrate to the hill over a rising sweep of ground, extending down in a less sloping manner and affording a better progress to troops advancing up the hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>But they sadly mistook this point of attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>It was now approaching night, and the fortunes of the day had only wavered momentarily at times towards the rebels, and the fight was growing desperate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>The troops were getting used to smoke, dust, and the din of battle, and the roar of cannon and the bursting of shells, more terrific than ever, seemed to have less effect upon the rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>They pressed up with fearful determination, column after column of fresh troops, and the courage of the whole army was at its best. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>The roar of musketry died away, and the engagement became an artillery contest, neither side attempting to advance. </p>
