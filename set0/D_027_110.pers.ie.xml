<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Substantial earthworks and extensive abattis protected them against a sudden assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Here they made night (every night) hideous with their uproar, which was of a character at once suggestive of a corn-shucking and a camp-meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Yesterday morning it was discovered, from our side, that this division had been drawn back somewhat from their old position, and that their works had been leveled and abattis cleared up.
