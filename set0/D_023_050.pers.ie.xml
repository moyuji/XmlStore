<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> The news from the line of the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>, though not so full and complete as we could desire, is nevertheless interesting and important.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>It is understood as perfectly reliable that the advance of our forces have reached <placeName reg="Manassas, Manassas, Virginia" key="tgn,2112877">Manassas Junction</placeName>, where they captured some <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="10">ten</num> heavy guns and an immense quantity of valuable stores. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> The portion of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army under <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName> was as <placeName reg="Warrenton, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2114921">Warrenton</placeName> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct>, and it is stated that its retreat in the direction of <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName> is entirely intercepted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The only route by which he could reach that point is by way of the <rs type="place">Junction</rs>, which is now in possession of our forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>It is not probable that he will succeed in forcing his way back to the <rs>Potomac</rs> by taking that route.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>If this statement be correct &mdash; and we have no reason to question its authenticity &mdash; the only road for his escape would seem to be by way of the <rs type="place">Plains</rs> to <placeName reg="Middleburg, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2113008">Middleburg</placeName>, and from thence to <placeName reg="Leesburg, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2112647">Leesburg, in Loudoun county</placeName>. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> We have no intelligence of any heavy fighting, and it is somewhat surprising that our troops have met with so few obstructions in their advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>In Government circles there seems to be not the slightest apprehension for the safety of our army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Indeed, we have reason to believe that the most lively hopes are entertained of a triumph which will eclipse any that has been vouchsafed to our arms since the war commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The intelligence that the enemy has been reinforced has created no uneasiness, and not the remotest idea of a reverse is entertained. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> To gum up the whole, we are warranted in the conclusion that the enemy's forces are so situated that a further retreat would be decidedly more disastrous than the acceptance of battle, and that in either event he is inevitably subjected to reverse from which it will be no easy matter to recover. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/> Yet, greatly as they commiserated that distress greatly as they admired the manly fortitude with which it had been endured, anxious as they must all be to relieve it, he was persuaded that the good sense of the people of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and the proper feeling even of the sufferers themselves, must acknowledge that the <rs>Government</rs> were wise in not endeavoring to aim at the relief of that distress by measures of war, which, so far from mitigating, would only have aggravated the evil.

All would hope that these evils must have an end; all must hope that better feelings and more charitable sentiments might make way on the other side of the <rs>Atlantic</rs>, and although hitherto there has appeared no relenting of the animosities of the contending parties, we might devoutly pray that peace would at length arise out of this afflicting war, and that another year might not see the continuance of that effusion of blood which now deluged the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>It will be easily believed that <persName n="Slidell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00155" reg="mostcommon:Slidell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Slidell</surname></persName> set forth all the arguments which, in his opinion, would justify the claim of a State to have its independence admitted &mdash; such as proved ability to defend itself against invasion, decided advantages obtained in the field since the commencement of hostilities, the constitutional conduct of its Government amid the vicissitudes and severe trials of a protracted war, and, which is not the least important, the determination of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> never to submit, but to fight for independence to the last, and at whatever coat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>If private accounts from Vichy speak truly, the <rs>Emperor</rs> did not seem disposed to controvert these arguments, but, on the contrary, to admit their cogency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>On this point permit me to quote a passage from <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName>'s reply to <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Malmesbury</foreName></persName>. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/> That there has been an <q>&#x0022;intimate and unreserved communication,&#x0022;</q> though not strictly official between the <name>Governments</name>, is perfectly true; but in certain (<persName n="French,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00156" reg="mostcommon:French,nomatch:0"><surname>French</surname></persName>) official quarters here it is not merely doubted, but positively denied, that there has been no difference of opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>In these quarters it is now, and has been for some time, asserted that the imperial Government of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> is in favor of recognition, and that it is the <rs>English Government</rs> that has held aloof, and still holds aloof; in a word, that, but for <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> would long ago have recognized the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>This, you will perceive, is somewhat in contradiction with <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName>'s statement, if by <q>&#x0022;no instance of a difference of opinion&#x0022;</q> is meant that both agree in postponing indefinitely the recognition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>That <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> has no such intention at present is evident from <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName>'s reply to the note of <persName n="Mason,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00157" reg="mostcommon:Mason,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Mason</surname></persName>, (the <rs>Southern Commissioner</rs> to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>,) formally demanding to be recognized. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/> Subsequently to his interview with the <rs>Emperor</rs>, it is said that <persName n="Slidell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00158" reg="mostcommon:Slidell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Slidell</surname></persName> had an interview with <persName n="Thouvenel,,M.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00159" reg="default:Thouvenel,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Thouvenel</surname></persName>, and that he presented a note about the same time as <persName n="Mason,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00160" reg="mostcommon:Mason,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Mason</surname></persName> in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>, and pressing on identical grounds the recognition of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>The unwillingness of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, if not her positive rejection of the demand, was, I believe, alleged as the principal if not the only reason why <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> did not act at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>The subject is certainly <num value="1">one</num> of great difficulty for <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>The very best reasons exist for her policy; but it is peculiarly unfortunate that we seem to get no credit on either side for the integrity of our motives, our intentions, or our acts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>It is impossible to be hated more than we are in the <rs>North</rs>, and, if it cannot be denied that we have acted impartially, the reasons assigned are anything but creditable, and the hope of convincing Northerners of our sincerity and our disinterestedness is but slight indeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>So far as the feeling against us is concerned, it may he doubted whether actual intervention would much aggravate it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/> Those who flatter themselves that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are tired of hostilities, and that they cannot be induced to continue them much longer, are laboring under a delusion which may prove disastrous, if not fatal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are as resolutely bent upon continuing the war as we are upon bringing it to an end. This sentiment is so general that it may be designated as universal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>It is confined to no <num value="1">one</num> class and no <num value="1">one</num> party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>There may be individual exceptions, but they are scarcely numerous enough to prove the rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>The general desire to avoid the draft is no proof of the negative side of the proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>The fiercest advocates of war are always to be found among those who wish to share none of its dangers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00257" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> cannot, if he would, discontinue hostilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Congress cannot do it, and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation will not. These facts are made apparent by the conversation of all the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisoners taken in the <name>Piedmont</name> country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>Their tone is, in spite of their reverses not only defiant, but triumphantly defiant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>They not only do not admit that they were beaten in the battles before <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, but claim a victory in every encounter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>They not only do not affect to be tired of the war, but exult in the prospect of its indefinite continuance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>What their programme is we stated the other day, and this is evidently the programme of their Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>They do not expect to subjugate us; that they regard as impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>But they desire to reduce the country to a wilderness by repeated incursions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>They hope to compel the <rs>Southern States</rs> to beg re-admission into the <rs>Union</rs>, that the inhabitants may not perish for want of bread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>They hope to drive out the owners of the soil, and to settle it up with <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>Many of them declared that such was their intention to Confederate officers who had interviews with them.--They are animated by the true Goth and Vandal spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>They are tired of their own bleak and sterile country, and they have fixed their eyes upon the pleasant places of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>They admire, enthusiastically, the magnificent <placeName reg="Valley of Virginia">Valley of Virginia</placeName> and the glorious <placeName reg="Piedmont region">Piedmont region</placeName>, which they have lately stripped of every green thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>They design to drive off the inhabitants, never to return, and to settle it up with <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>The war is to assume a character resembling that of the <rs n="Peloponnesian" type="ethnic">Peloponnesian</rs> war, in which all <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName> was desolated, and whole cities and districts changed their inhabitants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>Such are the objects of this infernal war, and thus far nothing has been done on our part to prevent its attainment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>It is true we beat the enemy whenever we meet him in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>We repel him from particular sections of country after he has converted them into a howling wilderness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>But there we stop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>We sit down and rejoice, and he goes to work to raise new bands of plunderers, whom he may turn loose upon us once more.--There can be no other end to such a system than the complete depopulation of the country and its re-settlement by <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>There is but <num value="1">one</num> way of putting a stop to it, and that is by carrying the war into the enemy's territory. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/> Are we prepared for this step?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>The spirit of the army is high, the men are burning with rage, they eagerly desire to avenge their ravaged country, and their outraged countrymen and countrywomen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>They exult in a sense of their superiority, not only to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, but to any army that treads the earth.
