<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> <hi rend="italics">Gentlemen of the <rs>Convention</rs>:</hi> I am far advanced in years and not in the habit of attending Conventions of this character, but I could not resist coming here to enter my protest against civil war. I have seen the horrors of such a conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>In the war of <date value="1812">1812</date> my house in <placeName reg="Plattsburgh, Clinton, New York" key="tgn,7016176">Plattsburg</placeName> was sacked by the <rs>British</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>A battle was fought opposite my very door, and the bullets that were fired fell like hailstones around my dwelling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>In the casement of my door remains to this day embedded <num value="1">one</num> of those bullets, a memento of the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>In that struggle I saw my fellow-citizens shot down by my side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>I know, then, the horrors of a foreign war, and they are nothing as compared with the horrors of a civil war. A civil war is a war among brethren.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>We are all brethren in this confederacy of States--the people of the <rs>South</rs> are our brethren &mdash; not only nominally, but actually our brethren.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7007248" n="1.000 10" reg="georgia">Georgia</placeName> alone, I have the names of <num value="1000">one thousand</num> citizens whose ancestors were the near relatives of my own. In the same State alone, are over <num value="100">one hundred</num> relatives of the family of <persName n="Hillhouse,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Hillhouse,nomatch:0"><surname>Hillhouse</surname></persName>, whose name is known as that of <num value="1">one</num> of the patriots of the <name>Revolution</name>, and whose descendant now occupies a seat in our <orgName n="State Senate" type="senate">State Senate</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>And so, scattered all over the <rs>Southern States</rs> are the near relatives of the men of the <rs>North</rs>, and perhaps there is scarcely a member of this Convention who has not some such ties in the <name>States</name> of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>It would be as brutal, in my opinion, to send men to butcher our own brothers of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, as it would be to massacre them in the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>We are told, however, that it is our duty to, and we must enforce the laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>But why &mdash; and what laws are to be enforced?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>There were laws that were to be enforced in the time of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Revolution, and the <orgName n="British Parliament" type="parliament">British Parliament</orgName> and <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>North</foreName></persName> sent armies here to enforce them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>But what did <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> say in regard to the enforcement of those laws?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>That man-- honored at home and abroad more than any other man on earth ever was honored &mdash; did he go for enforcing the laws?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>No, he went to resist laws that were oppressive against a free people, and against the injustice of which they rebelled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Did <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Chatham</foreName></persName> go for enforcing the laws?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>No, he gloried in defence of the liberties of <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>He made that memorable declaration in the <orgName n="British Parliament" type="parliament">British Parliament</orgName>--<q>&#x0022;If I were an <orgName n="American Citizen" type="newspaper">American citizen</orgName>, instead of as I am, an <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishman</rs>, I never would submit to such laws &mdash; never, never, never&#x0022;</q> Such is the spirit that animates our Southern brethren, and shall we war upon them for it. No; we must avert civil war if possible, and I close by exhorting my brethren to do all in their power to avert civil war. Concession, conciliation &mdash; anything but that &mdash; and no man amongst us in his dying hour will regret that his conscience is clear, and that he can lay his hand upon his heart and say, <q>&#x0022;I did all in my power to turn from the bosom of my country the horrible blow of a civil war.&#x0022;</q> </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/> The speaker, after arguing the question of negro slavery as it exists, and showing that it was right in principle and in the abstract, went on to allude to the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>, which he said worked well while in the hands of those to whom it was confided by its framers, but very badly since it had got into the hands of the trading politicians of the present day who know nothing of the science of political economy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>In this connection he spoke of the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> insults to Southern men, which had not been properly resented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>In vivid language he drew a contrast between society in the free and slave States, and alluded to the slavery of whites at the <rs>North</rs>, who are glad to perform the most menial labor to keep from starving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>In the free States, competition was so great, there being always <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> men to <num value="1">one</num> job of work, that the price of labor was reduced to a standard scarcely adequate to keep soul and body together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>Such a state of things could never exist in a slave country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>He said he did not come here to urge the people to vote for this man or that man for the <orgName n="State Convention" type="convention">State Convention</orgName>; it was not his business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>For <measure n="15years" type="date">fifteen years</measure> he had been expressing the same ideas now advanced, in view of the crisis at present distracting the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>With regard to a dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs>, he made but few remarks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>To show how deep had been his own attachment for the <rs>Union</rs>, he called the attention of the audience to the division of the <orgName n="Methodist Church" type="church">Methodist Church</orgName>, which was so distracted by discussions of the slavery question that he saw a continuance of the union with the <orgName n="Northern Church" type="church">Northern Church</orgName> must inevitably lead to a calamitous result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>To prevent this, he voted to separate from those with whom he had long been united by sacred ties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>The entire address was a logical and profound elucidation of the subject announced, and if there was a heart that did not glow more warmly with a love for the <rs>South</rs> and her institutions, it would not respond to the patriot's boast that his <q>&#x0022;<num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, best country ever is at home.&#x0022;</q> </p>
