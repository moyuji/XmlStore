<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/> I have the honor to submit a report of the part taken by the <rs>Gaines</rs>, under my command, in the action of the <dateStruct value="--5"><day reg="5">5th instant</day></dateStruct>, off <placeName key="tgn,7013918" n="1.000 18" reg="fort morgan, baldwin, alabama">Fort Morgan</placeName>, and the circumstances which led to the beaching and abandonment of the ship. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/> The <rs>Gaines</rs> was cleared for action about <time value="6:20am">6.20 A. M.</time>, and in obedience to signal from the <rs>Admiral</rs> to &#x0022;follow his motions,&#x0022; waited for him to open upon the advancing enemy &mdash; advancing with <num value="4">four</num> monitors in line ahead, and <num value="14">fourteen</num> wooden vessels by twos, each large ship having a smaller <num value="1">one</num> lashed to her port side &mdash; the whole forming <num value="1">one</num> complete line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>As soon as the <rs>Tennessee</rs> delivered fire, the <rs>Gaines</rs> &mdash; having placed herself next the <rs>Admiral</rs> &mdash; commenced at about <measure n="2000yards" type="distance">two thousand yards</measure> distance with her pivot guns upon the leading wooden ships, supposed to be the <rs>Hartford</rs> and her consort, at about <num value="6.50">6.50</num>, as nearly as I can determine, and continued to deliver a raking fire upon the leading wooden ships until their passage past the fort.--She then made <num value="1">one</num> circle to prevent too close action &mdash; as she was lying nearly in the track of the advancing fleet &mdash; and afterwards steered in nearly parallel lines, with the enemy, at distances gradually diminishing, until she was within at least <measure n="700yards" type="distance">seven hundred yards</measure>, and engaging with her port guns. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/> The enemy being now clear of the fort, was enabled to direct attention exclusively to our little squadron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>Early in the action a shell exploded near the steering-wheel, wounding the <num value="2">two</num> men stationed at it, and cutting the wheel-rope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>The ship was then steered with the relieving tackles until the after wheel-ropes could be rove.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>Shortly after this it was reported that the forward magazine was filled with smoke, and thought to be on fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>This, on examination, luckily, proved a mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>An <measure n="11inch" type="distance">eleven-inch</measure> shot had entered the starboard bow, striking the deck above the magazine, had broken it in, and made so much dust that the gunner's mate, serving powder in that magazine, thought it smoke, and believed from the shock and dust a shell had exploded and fired that part of the ship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>He reported accordingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>This occasioned a short delay in the serving of powder to the forward division.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>The firemen of this division, with hose and buckets, went promptly to the spot, under the executive officer, and soon discovered the mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>About this time the ship was subjected to a very heavy, concentrated fire from the <rs>Hartford</rs>, <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> and others, at short range, as the enemy passed me. Nearly their whole fire seemed for a time to be directed at the <rs>Gaines</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>The after magazine was now discovered filling with water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>I went below to examine it, and found much water had accumulated in it, and was rapidly increasing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>Not being aware of any shot having entered, near the water, that part of the ship, and being unable to see any damage upon inspection from the side which could have caused such a leak, I directed the executive officer, with the carpenter's mate, to get into a boat and make examination of the counter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/> He found a shot had broken in the outer planking under the port quarter about the water line, and which, from marks, seemed to have glanced below in the direction of the stern-post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>This could not be stopped by reason of the impossibility of getting to it, because of the flare of the counter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>As this break could not have caused all the water which flowed into the ship, I am of opinion that it was a shell which caused the break, and had probably exploded below water, under the counter, and had started the timbers near the stern-post; the ship had received a shock during the engagement which shook her from stem to stern, being much more violent than that of shots passing through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>The bilge pumps were immediately worked, but there was no water in the engine room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>Finding the magazines rapidly filling, also, the after hold and shell room, with no water in the engine room, I caused the after bulkhead of the engine room to be knocked down, so as to allow the flow of water to the bilge pumps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>By this time the stern had settled some, and the steering became difficult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>Under these circumstances, I determined to withdraw from action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>The enemy's fleet had now passed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/> Finding the ship would sink in a short time, and thinking I might be able to reach the shore, now about <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles distant</measure>, I withdrew from action and made the best of my way towards the fort, steering the ship principally with the side-wheels, which position I reached without embarrassment from the enemy &mdash; thankful to an opportune rain-squall which shut me from view &mdash; and placed her bow upon the beach, within <placeName><distance reg="500yards">five hundred yards</distance> of <placeName key="tgn,7013918" n="1.000 18" reg="fort morgan, baldwin, alabama">Fort Morgan</placeName></placeName>, at about <num value="9.30">9.30</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/> I am happy to state there was no confusion nor panic under the circumstances of our position, but that every work was done with deliberation and without undue excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>The ship delivered fire to the enemy at the moment of striking the shore. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/> At the time of beaching, the magazine was nearly filled; I had caused all the powder to be removed to the cabin; the shells were removed as rapidly as possible, but not before many of them had become submerged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>The usefulness of the ship having been destroyed by the enemy, I devoted myself and crew to the preservation of all valuable <hi rend="italics">materiel;</hi> and landed all the powder, shell, shot, gun equipments, &#x0026;c., which I gave to the general commanding at <placeName key="tgn,7013918" n="1.000 18" reg="fort morgan, baldwin, alabama">Fort Morgan</placeName>, to whom I thought they might be useful in the expected siege.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>The crew were then landed, with their bags and blankets, muskets, cutlasses, and small-arm ammunition, and the ship abandoned at <time value="12oclock">12 o'clock</time>, with her battle-flags flying and her stern settle as far as it could &mdash; about <num value="2">two</num> fathoms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>I did not spike the guns, because they could be secured by the fort and could not be taken by the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/> Having thus left my command, it became necessary to devise a retreat for my crew &mdash; they were not necessary to the fort, as I was informed when I offered their services.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>Already I had secured <num value="2">two</num> boats belonging to the <rs>Tennessee</rs> &mdash; left by her at anchor, and with <num value="4">four</num> boats of the <rs>Gaines</rs>--<num value="1">one</num> having been destroyed by shot &mdash; I left the fort at <time value="8pm">8 o'clock P.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>Not a man was lost by straggling, and I brought up the wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>The dead were buried on the afternoon of the <num value="5" type="ordinal">5th</num> in the fort's burial ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>We had only <measure n="2" type="killed">two killed</measure> and <measure n="3" type="wounded">three wounded</measure>. The surgeon's report of the casualties I herewith enclose. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/> Whilst running the gauntlet up the bay, I became apprehensive of capture, or of being forced to land and make a march to <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>; the <rs>Morgan</rs> was being chased by the enemy; as I knew it was her intention to pass near the <rs>Eastern</rs> shore, and could see her approach us, I feared she might lead the enemy upon the boats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>Under these circumstances, I deemed it prudent to drop the signal book into the sea.--I did so. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/> The officers and crew of the <rs>Gaines</rs>, for about <num value="10">ten</num> or <measure n="15minutes" type="date">fifteen minutes</measure>, were subjected to a very heavy fire from the enemy at short distance, and, I am proud to say, stood it with great gallantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>There were <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> exceptional cases only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>If we take into consideration the fact that they are new levies, who will lose at least half their number before the other half become tolerable soldiers, we may say with truth that they will not fill up the gaps in the ranks.

It will not do for us to depend upon resistance to the measure in the <rs>North</rs> by mobs, insurrections and popular commotions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>We must recruit our own ranks to meet the accession of force which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army will be certain to receive, and we must do it speedily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>There are numbers of able-bodied men doing what disabled soldiers could do just as well; numbers of white men doing what negroes could do much better; and numbers of young men doing nothing at all. We want the services of all these &mdash; the country requires them &mdash; the crisis demands them &mdash; and the <rs type="place">Bureau of Conscription</rs> has already indicated who and what they are, and where to be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>The <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> that must elapse before the campaign shall have closed are important months to us. If employed as they might be, they would, in all probability, become the period from which to date the rise of a feeling on the part of our enemy that may tend to peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>The campaign thus far has been a losing business to him.
