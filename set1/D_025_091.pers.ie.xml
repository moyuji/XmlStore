<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>The South is to be made a territory and province of the <rs>North</rs>, governed by Northern viceroys, and deprived of every badge and monument of freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>We are obliged to <persName n="Hamlin,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00160" reg="nearbymention:Hamlin,Hannibal,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hamlin</surname></persName> for this candid and logical avowal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>But if he imagines there is anything novel, startling, or alarming to anybody in the <rs>South</rs> in the propositions which he announces with such a flourish, his absurdity is equal to his impudence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>Whatever illusion Northern <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs> may cherish, the restoration of the <rs>Union</rs> upon its old principles is a simple impossibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>It involves on the part of the <rs>South</rs> degradation which subjugation does not. To be conquered and crushed does not imply dishonor, even where the combatants are equally matched, much less where the odds are <num value="4">four</num> to <num value="1">one</num> on the side of the victor, and where the vanquished has struggled heroically, though in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>No man can be degraded who is not consenting to his own dishonor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>Whatever betide us in the future, we shall never be guilty of the infamy of voluntarily living under a Government which has committed such crimes against our people and against humanity itself as the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>Grasp again in friendship those hands red with the blood of our children!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>The menace of subjugation is mercy itself compared to the unspeakable insult and ignominy of such a thought. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/> We are aware that <persName n="Hamlin,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00161" reg="nearbymention:Hamlin,Hannibal,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hamlin</surname></persName> and his <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republicans</rs> mean only the most infernal malice in refusing us the precious privilege of ever again becoming their friends and countrymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>But, whatever his motives, he proposes to us a punishment which we prefer to the infamy of a voluntary return to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>After all, he would only make us a province in name, as we were under the old Union in fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>We were hewers of wood and drawers of water for our <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> taskmasters, and flattered with the name of sovereign States; but the moment we exercised that essential attribute of sovereignty, of choosing to set up for ourselves, <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00162" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> called out <num value="75000">75,000</num> men, and afterwards a <num value="1000000">million</num>, to convince us, in his own words, that a State holds the same relation to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> that a county does to a State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>The only change, so far as we can see, which <persName n="Hamlin,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00163" reg="nearbymention:Hamlin,Hannibal,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hamlin</surname></persName> proposes, is to call things by their right names, and no longer to mock the old provincial of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> with the insignia and titles of freedom and independence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/> It will be time enough, however, for the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> orators to provide for the future enslavement of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> when they have shown their ability to carry out their magnificent bravado, or even to preserve their own freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>Their efforts hitherto to conquer us have only resulted in the loss of their own liberties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>Instead of making us provinces, they have made themselves slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>Their last Congress put the entire population and purse of the <rs>North</rs> at the command of the <rs>President</rs>; their next Congress will find the grand <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> cowering around the fortifications of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.
