<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>I am sure that no <num value="1">one</num> can entertain for them individually or collectively less personal respect than I do, and yet I do give them credit for more sincerity and intelligence than is consistent with the idea that in obtaining power they will refuse to exercise it for the only purpose for which they professed to seek it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> The facts and considerations which I have endeavored to bring to your view present the propriety of resistance on the part of the <rs>South</rs> to the election of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> in a very different light from the mere question of resisting the election of a President who has been chosen in the usual and constitutional mode.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>It is not simply that a comparatively obscure abolitionist, who hates the institutions of the <rs>South</rs>, has been elected <rs type="role2">President</rs>, and that we are asked to live under the administration of a man who commands neither our respect nor confidence; that the <rs>South</rs> contemplates resistance even to disunion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Wounded honor might tolerate the outrage until by another vote of the people the nuisance could be abated, but the election of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> involves far higher considerations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>It brings to the <rs>South</rs> the solemn judgment of a majority of the people of every Northern State--with a solitary exception &mdash; in favor of doctrines and principles violative of her constitutional rights, humiliating to her pride, destructive of her equality in the <rs>Union</rs>, and fraught with the greatest danger to the peace and safety of her people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>It can be regarded in no other light than a declaration of the purposes and intentions of the people of the <rs>North</rs> to continue, with the power of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, the war already commenced by the <num value="10">ten</num> nullifying States of the <rs>North</rs> upon the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> and the constitutional rights of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>To these acts of bad faith the <rs>South</rs> has heretofore submitted, though constituting ample justification for abandoning a compact which had been wantonly violated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The question is now presented, whether longer submission to an increasing spirit and power of aggression is compatible either with her honor or her safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>In my mind there is no room for doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The issue must now be met or forever abandoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Equality and safety in the <rs>Union</rs> are at an end, and it only remains to be seen whether our manhood is equal to the task of asserting and maintaining independence out of it. The Union formed by our fathers was <num value="1">one</num> of equality, justice and fraternity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>On the <date value="05-04">4th of March</date> it will be supplanted by a Union of sectionalism and hatred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The <num value="1">one</num> was worthy of the support and devotion of freemen, the other can only continue at the cost of your honor, your safety, and your independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Is there no remedy for this state of things but immediate secession?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>None worthy of your conservatism has been suggested, except the recommendation of <persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName>, of new constitutional guarantees, or rather the clear and explicit recognition of those that already exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>This recommendation is the counsel of a patriotic statesman.--It exhibits an appreciation of the evils that are upon us, and at the same time a devotion to the <rs>Constitution</rs> and its sacred guarantees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>It conforms to the record of <persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName>'s life on this distracting question &mdash; the record of a pure heart and wise head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>It is the language of a man whose heart is overwhelmed with a sense of the great wrong and injustice that has been done to the minority section, mingled with an ardent hope and desire to preserve that Union to which he has devoted the energies of a long and patriotic life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The difficulty is that there will be no response to it from those who alone have it in their power to act. Black Republicanism is the ruling sentiment at the <rs>North</rs>, and by the election of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> has pronounced in the most formal and solemn manner against the principles which are now commended to the country for its safety and preservation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>As a matter of course they will spurn these words of wisdom and patriotism, as they have before turned their back upon all the teachings of the good and true men of the land, or else they will play with us if their insidious warfare to delude the <rs>South</rs> into a false security, that they <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> may the more effectually rivet their iron chains, and thereby put resistance in the future beyond our power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>They have trampled upon the <rs>Constitution</rs> of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and <persName n="Madison,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Madison,nomatch:0"><surname>Madison</surname></persName>, and will prove equally faithless to their pledges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>You ought not, cannot trust them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>It is not the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> which need amendments; but the hearts of the <rs>Northern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>To effect the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> would be a hopeless undertaking, whilst the latter is an impossibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/> --<hi rend="italics">Important Semi-Official Declaration.</hi>--There is in the <rs>Invalids Ruses</rs> an article upon the interview at <placeName reg="Warsaw, Wyoming, New York" key="tgn,2072966">Warsaw</placeName>, which, coming from so important an organ of the <rs>Russian</rs> government, demands special attention. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/> The writer addresses himself to the subject of the statement, conveyed by telegraph to <persName n="London,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00330" reg="mostcommon:London,nomatch:0"><surname>London</surname></persName>, that at <placeName reg="Warsaw, Wyoming, New York" key="tgn,2072966">Warsaw</placeName> questions had been put by <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName> as to whether the latter would recognize what had passed in <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>; and secondly as to her attitude in case of <placeName reg="Piemonte, Italia, Europe" key="tgn,7003120">Piedmont</placeName> being supported by another power?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>Professing to discuss these questions in the light of mere hypotheses, the writer points to the withdrawal of the <rs>Russian</rs> embassy from Tourin, as proof of the dissatisfaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>But he goes on to argue that between blame of principles and refusal to recognize facts when they become accomplished there is a wide difference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>If the &#x0022;unification&#x0022; of <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName> should become a fact, through the will of <num value="24000000">twenty-four millions</num> of people, there would be no good reason for refusing to recognize it, for it would not be possible to break off international relations with so important a portion of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/><placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> had passed, within half a century, through various forms of government, which neither prevented recognition of actual Powers nor of the rights claimed by excluded heirs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>With regard to the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> question, referring to <placeName reg="Venezia, Venezia, Veneto" key="tgn,7018159">Venetia</placeName> and the possible alliance of <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and <placeName reg="Piedmont" key="tgn,7003120">Piedmont</placeName>, the writer remarks that <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> has already declared that should <placeName reg="Piemonte, Italia, Europe" key="tgn,7003120">Piedmont</placeName> attack <placeName key="tgn,7018159" n="1.000 1" reg="venezia,venezia,veneto,italia,europe">Venice</placeName>, she must do so upon her own responsibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>Accepting, however, the supposition of <placeName key="tgn,7018159" n="1.000 1" reg="venezia,venezia,veneto,italia,europe">Venice</placeName> being attacked, the writer observes that if the treaties of <date value="1815">1815</date> give <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName> her claim to that province, the people, upon the other hand, speak in favor of <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>Why should <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, however, be called upon to interfere by force of arms in favor of <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName>, and against the <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italian</rs> population?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>The writer answers &mdash; The history of this province is known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>To the end of the <num value="18" type="ordinal">eighteenth</num> century it was an independent <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italian</rs> republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/><persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00331" reg="nearbymention:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> destroyed and seized it. When coalesced <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> vanquished the <rs>Emperor</rs>, <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName>, in her turn, and by right of conquest, seized upon <name>French</name> possessions in <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>To-day <placeName key="tgn,7018159" n="1.000 1" reg="venezia,venezia,veneto,italia,europe">Venice</placeName> desires to be annexed to <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>Never, then, for the sake of preserving <placeName key="tgn,7018159" n="1.000 1" reg="venezia,venezia,veneto,italia,europe">Venice</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName>, ought <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> to be required to begin a general war; and, although we do not know the answer of the <rs>Northern Cabinets</rs> to the question of <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName>, yet no <num value="1">one</num> can doubt that <placeName key="tgn,7016786" n="1.000 94" reg="prussia">Prussia</placeName>, and still less <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>, not having any serious interest in <placeName key="tgn,7018159" n="1.000 1" reg="venezia,venezia,veneto,italia,europe">Venice</placeName>, cannot, consequently, ever make war on account of this province.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>This, assuredly, is conclusive upon the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>Neither <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName> nor <placeName key="tgn,7016786" n="1.000 94" reg="prussia">Prussia</placeName> will draw the sword for <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName> on account of <placeName key="tgn,7018159" n="1.000 1" reg="venezia,venezia,veneto,italia,europe">Venice</placeName>.
