<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>He says: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> After the most strenuous exertions on the part of its officers, the <rs>State</rs> finds it impossible to clothe and shoe our soldiers without again appealing to that overflowing fountain of generous charity&#x0022;the private contributions of our people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The rigors of winter are approaching, our soldiers are already suffering, and must suffer more if our sympathies are not practical and actives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The <orgName n="Quartermaster Department" type="department">Quartermaster's department</orgName> is laboring faithfully to provide for them, but, owing to speculation and extortion, will fall short.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The deficiency must be supplied by the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>We shall have an active winter campaign, and how can our troops, if ragged, cold and barefoot, contend with the splendidly equipped columns of the enemy? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> The articles most needed, and which the <rs>State</rs> finds it most difficult to supply, are shoes, socks, and blankets, though drawers, shirts, and pants, would be gladly received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>If every farmer who has hides tanning would agree to spare <num value="1">one</num> pair of shoes, and if every mother in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> would knit <num value="1">one</num> strong pair of either thick cotton or woolen seeks for the army, they would be abundantly supplied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>A great lot of blankets, also, might yet be spared from private use, and <num value="1000">thousands</num> could be made from the carpets upon our parlor floors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>With good, warm houses and cotton bed clothing, we can certainly get through the winter much better than the soldiers can with all the blankets we can give them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/> The <rs>Colonels</rs> of the militia regiments throughout the <rs>State</rs> are hereby appointed agents for the purchase and collection of all such articles as can be spared by our people, who, through their respective captains, are ordered immediately to canvass every county and visit every citizen in their beats for this purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>A liberal price will be paid for everything where the owner feels that he or she is not able to donate it, and active agents will immediately forward them to our suffering regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Expenses will be allowed the officers engaged in this duty, and transportation furnished the colonels or their agents to bring the articles to <placeName reg="Raleigh, Wake, North Carolina" key="tgn,7013949">Raleigh</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> And now, my countryman and woman, if you have anything to spare for the soldier, in his name I appeal to you for it. Do not let the speculator have it, though he offer you enormous prices; spurn him from your door, and say to him that our brave defenders have need for it, and shall have it without passing through his greedy fingers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Do not place yourselves among the extortioners &mdash; they are the vilest and most cowardly of all our country's enemies, and when this war is ended, and people come to view the matter in its proper light, you will find that the most detested tories are more respected than they.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>When they tempt you with higher prices than the <rs>State</rs> offers, just think for a moment of the soldier and what he is doing for you. Remember, when you sit down by the bright and glowing fire, that the soldier is sitting upon the cold earth; that in the wind, which is whistling so fearfully over your roof, only making your feel the more comfortable because it harms you not, he is shivering in darkness on the dangerous out post, or shuddering through the dreary hours of his watch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Remember, that when you some forth in the morning, well fed and warmly clad, leading your families toward the spot where the blessed music of the <name>Sabbath</name> bells tells you of the peaceful worship of the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of Peace, the soldier is going forth at the same moment, perhaps half fed, after a night of shivering and suffering, to where the roar of artillery and shout of battle announce that he is to die that your peace and safety may be preserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Oh, remember these things, generous and patriotic people of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, and give freely of your perishable goods to those who are giving all that mortal man can give for your safety and your rights.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/> No <num value="1">one</num> can read the accounts of the atrocities perpetrated by the <rs>Federal</rs> troops in various parts of the country without being thoroughly satisfied that there is no length of crime to which that infernal despotism is not prepared to go. We may look in the future for such scenes as the <rs>French Revolution</rs> and <placeName reg="Republicana Dominicana" key="tgn,7005388">St. Domingo</placeName> combined, unless we prepare to prevent them by the most prompt and vigorous measures of public defence, and to realists, life for life, for every act of cruelty and bloodshed perpetrated upon our people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/> We need not give a catalogue of the atrocities already perpetrated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>They are too fresh, too sickening, to hear recital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>The last is the <rs>Missouri</rs> massacre, published in this paper lately, and called by the murderers a <q>&#x0022;military execution.&#x0022;</q> From the slaughter of women and children in <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName> in the beginning of the war, down to this last butchery, there has been a volume of horrors, especially in the <rs>West</rs>, such as the annals of civilized conflicts have rarely displayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>But this war has not been like any ordinary war. It commenced with an openly avowed programme in the streets of New York, of murder, arson, and rape, and it has reached its climax of malice and evil intent, in the wholesale confiscation acts of Congress and the abolition proclamation of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00151" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>The man who cries <q>&#x0022;Peace peace,&#x0022; </q> now, would be able to see hope and consolation amid the fires of the infernal pit. The scenes through which we have passed are but the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> mutterings of the storm; the tempest in its concentrated wrath, has yet to come.--The mariner who would save his ship must summon all its resources to the rescue, and call all hands on deck, or the impending ruin, if it does not altogether engulf him, will leave his vessel a crippled wreck upon the waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>He must be a blind man who has not recognized the frequent interpositions of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> in our behalf; but he is a fool who expects the gods to help those who do not help themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/><placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> gives us opportunities of preparation and resistance, but if we do not <unclear></unclear> and make the best of them the consequences rest upon our own hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>Even the <name>Divine</name> founder of our religion refused to incur danger unnecessarily, and thereby taught us a lesson of wisdom which we would do well not to despise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>We have been on the eve of losing our capital over and over again, from sheer negligence and procrastination.--Shall we go on tempting destiny in this mad way?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>Where are the new levies authorized by the late Congress?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>Why are they not at least being organized and drilled, so as to be ready for service? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/> We know that the <rs>Government</rs> has its hands full of great and momentous matters; we believe that it is often condemned unjustly; we have no right to expect infallibility of it. But we sometimes fear that it is disposed to underrate the necessity of prompt and thorough preparation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>For our own part, we can see no signs of clearing away, either in the <rs>North</rs> or the <rs>Northwest</rs>, where mariners generally look for signs of promise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>The <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> and <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs> differ as to the mode of butchering and subjugating us, but it is only a difference of form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>We have no dependence except in Heaven and our own strong arms. </p> </div3>

<head>The surest way to <q>&#x0022;Preserve the <rs>Union</rs>.&#x0022;</q></head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/> The notion which is expressed by many war <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs> of the <rs>North</rs>, that a <q>&#x0022;<hi rend="italics">vigorous prosecution of hostilities,</hi>&#x0022;</q> on strictly <hi rend="italics">constitutional</hi> principles, in a sure way to <q>&#x0022; <hi rend="italics">preserve the <rs>Union</rs>.</hi>&#x0022;</q> is about as unmitigated a piece of lunacy as ever emanated from a madhouse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>The more announcement of the proposition is its own answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>It is like saying that the surest way to preserve our planetary system (to which it was once the fashion to like the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>) would be to withdraw all the centripetal forces, and give full play to the centrifugal; for the central sun to petals into the stars, and smash them into an eternal conjunction with himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>Or, to adopt another figure, if it like a man undertaking to restore the love of a who, whose affections he had alternated by pounding her to a <unclear></unclear> We can comprehend the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> logic.--When they say they mean to subjugate or exterminate us, there is no more difficulty in understanding them than there is in understanding a <unclear>hyens,</unclear> or a wolf, or a rattlesnake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>We know that they have determined to make us slaves or to have our blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>But the <rs>Democratic</rs> jargon of restoring the old Union, and by force placing the <name>States</name> just where they were before secession, is such rank absurdity that they can scarcely expect anybody to believe what they say, not even excepting themselves.--Any other supposition simplifies such ignorance of the sentiment and human nature of the <rs>South</rs> and of human nature to general, as in scarcely conceivable among men of ordinary intelligence, especially adroit and long-headed politicians. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/> Do they expect the <rs>South</rs> ever to forgive the unspeakable wrongs she has suffered in this invasion?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>Do they imagine that she could ever consent to sit down at the same national table with the murderers whose hands are dripping with the blood of her children?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>The question is not, can we be subjugated; can we be held under the same Government by force; can we be kept down as <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName> keeps down <placeName key="tgn,7006278" n="1.000 27" reg="magyarorszag">Hungary</placeName>, and as the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republicans</rs> openly propose to keep us down &mdash; but, being subjugated, can the old Union, which had no other cohesive power than the mutual love and confidence of its people, be re-established?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>Even if the <rs>South</rs> could consent to such immeasurable degradation, what would be the value of her action when she has no longer a will of her own?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>How can she be at once enslaved and free?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>How can the <name>States</name> be at once subjugated and sovereign?--It is obvious that all this is sheer nonsense, intended to deceive, and that the <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs> of the <rs>North</rs> are as thorough Consolidationists as the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republicans</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/> We do not charge the <rs>Northern</rs> <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> with being as thoroughly demoniac and devilish as the <name>Lincolnites</name> proper and the <name>Abolitionists</name>.--With the exception of the <name>Robespierre</name> faction, as bloody and remorseless a set of hell hounds never before howled for human blood as the <rs>Northern Abolitionists</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>But, practically, what is the difference between them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/><persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00152" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, who is a Breckinridge <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrat</rs>, calls upon the army to sustain the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs>, no matter what policy it may proclaim?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>What more could the <name>Abolition</name> <persName n="Hunter,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00153" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hunter</surname></persName> do, if he were in <address><street n="McClellan's place">McClellan's place</street></address>?--We have lately had on the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James River</placeName> the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> fruits of that hideous proclamation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>In what respects is <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00154" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>, the vilest beast in human form that ever walked the earth, any more acceptable than a <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>We put no dependence in any Northern party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>The South should look for help only to Heaven and herself, not to any Northern party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>There is a just <name n="God" type="God">God</name> that rules, and a <name n="God" type="God">God</name> who has proclaimed that, though <q>&#x0022;clouds and darkness are round about him, righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his seat.&#x0022;</q> In Him we trust, and by His aid and our own strong right arm we are certain to conquer. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
