<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>It became the custom to choose some unknown man for that purpose, with the well understood design of making him a tool of party, a more agent of the political establishment by which he had been placed in power, and this, for the base and sordid purpose of securing the public revenue so as to distribute it entirely among the train hands of the successful party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>He did not perceive that delay of an open rupture must continue to add to Northern strength and to Southern weakness.
