<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> So far as we are able to judge from the extract published by us the other day, the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> the great organ of <name>English</name> sentiment is as much averse to recognizing the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> as ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>It has now completely shifted its ground; and whereas it opposed recognition <measure n="8months" type="date">eight months</measure> ago, because the <rs>Confederacy</rs> had given no proof of its ability to maintain its independence, <hi rend="italics">now</hi> it opposes it because it has given abundant evidence of its power to take care of itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>This method of handling an argument is common enough while those who are predetermined to support particular line of action at all bazaar, and is sufficiently characteristic of the <hi rend="italics">Times,</hi> We wish it would be candid, and say at once what, in its view, constitutes good ground for recognition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Is a State to be recognized because she is too weak to establish her independence, or is she to be recognized because she is strong enough to maintain it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>We wish to know from curiosity merely, not that it is a matter of any importance to us. We seriously believe, as we have heretofore had occasion to remark, that recognition without a powerful intervention &mdash; such as <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> is not likely to make &mdash; would be productive of well rather thin injury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Such an intervention as is implied in a blockable would throw into the hands of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government whole classes of men to recruit their armies by <unclear> </unclear> them out of other employment, and leaving them no alternative but to fight or starve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>It would strengthen their financial status, by shutting them out from the world, and confining their circulation entirely to themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Recognition and intervention, therefore, unless backed by a land force of half a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men, would do us no good and might do us much harm. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Let our existence be so clearly established as to require no acknowledgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Let it be as notorious as the existence of the sun. That it may be so, we have only to defend our rights as we have done theretofore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Valor and perseverance such as the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> have shown must achieve their independence in the end, and the conquest will be so much the more valuable that it was made without assistance, and even without encouragement from the other Governments of the earth. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> It is gratifying to perceive from the extracts before alluded to that the <rs>English</rs> people are is far as ever from being deceived by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> reports of their explodes.--They speak in terms of the highout admiration of the valor of our troops, and the skill of our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, and appear to entertain no doubt whatever that so much skill and, so much valor cannot fail to be successful in the end. Even the <hi rend="italics">News,</hi> controlled entirely by <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, is compelled to acknowledge that the <rs>Southern</rs> people, though the most barbarous of <persName n="Saxon,,Anglos,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="default:Saxon,Anglos,,,"><foreName>Anglos</foreName> <surname>Saxon</surname></persName> communities, can at least <hi rend="italics">fight.</hi> The abuse of such it cheat as the <hi rend="italics">News</hi> is the highest compliment that can be paid to Southern civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The acknowledgment wrung from it by the valor of our triumps is more valuable then the studied endorsed of more respectable <unclear></unclear>. We do not desire to be praised by mostly such journal as the <hi rend="italics">News</hi> but we <unclear></unclear> in the success which has forced it to acknowledge the valor of our troops and the skill of our fenders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The <hi rend="italics">News</hi> would not that we should be recognized among the nations of the earth; for the very reason that we have shown it strives as powerful as the best of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The battles we have fought have been the bloodiest or moderns times, and they have succeeded each other with a rapidity that almost relies calculation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>In all of them we have been victorious and in some of them we have strick blows which would have gone night to prostrate any throne in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>It should be recollected in the meantime, that our enemy is <num value="3">three</num> times as numerous as we are, that he possesses a powerful navy while we have none, that he has been, from the commencement of the war, provided with the best arts, the utmost abundance of ammunition, and stoves unlimited in quantity, while we in the beginning were poorly armed, and greatly deficient in ammunition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The skill of our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> has, in every instance nearly, <unclear></unclear> to the courage and perseverance of our troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>We may place the man&#x0153;uvres by which the battles around <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> were won, the operations, against <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName>, the advance into <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, and the capture of <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>, alongside of any man&#x0153;uvres executed by any General within the last <measure n="100years" type="date">hundred years</measure>, <placeName reg="Frederick, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002161">Frederick</placeName> and <persName n="Bonaparte,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Bonaparte,nomatch:0"><surname>Bonaparte</surname></persName> not excepted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>We who live in these times do not appreciate them as they will be appreciated by posterity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>We are making history on a grander scale than it ever was made before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Our army and its chiefs will, <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> hence, be regarded with the same admiration that waits upon the grand army and the <name>Marshals</name> of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>It proposes simply and purely to levy an income tax a tax upon all the principal productions of the soil for the present year, and upon the income for the year from all sources, of every citizen of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, private and public corporation, association or partnership, to the extent of <num value="1">one</num> <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> part &mdash; to be paid by the <date value="1863-04-01">1st of April, 1863.</date> There is a provision, however, which exempts from the payment of the tax all persons whose productions and incomes shall not amount to <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">five hundred dollars</measure>, and an exception as to income from Confederate bonds and stocks.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/> The committee in arranging the bill desired to impose the burden of the tax upon those only who may be able to bear it; to exempt such as might not be able, and to make the tax as equal as possible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>In the existing condition of the country, a part of our territory being still occupied by the enemy, it was found difficult so to arrange the provisions of the bill as to impose and collect the tax in equal and just proportions from all the citizens of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>To remedy this and place it in the power of Congress hereafter to equalize the taxes necessary to the support of Government and <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> <unclear></unclear> defence of the country, provision is made by the bill that persons paying the taxes imposed by it shall receive for the amount paid a <num value="0.06">six per cent</num>, bond of the <rs>Government</rs> payable at <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> or as any time after, within <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> from the date, at the pleasure of the <rs>Government</rs>, the interest to be paid annually.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>This provision will in effect secure the tax payer in having refunded to him are amount paid under the present bill, and leave it in the power of Congress hereafter, in raising by taxation whatever may be necessary for the defence of the country, to equalize the burden of taxation among the people of all the <name>States</name> composing the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>This provision will have another good effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>It will leave it in the power of Congress, when the expenses of the existing war come to be footed up and adjusted, so to provide as to make a fair and just division between the present generation and posterity. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/> The amount of the tax--<num value="1">one</num>-<num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> of the value of all the cotton, tobacco, sugar, molasses, corn, rice, rye, cats, potatoes, peas, hemp, flax, beans, barley, hay, wool, rosin, tar, pitch and turpentine, produced in <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, and <num value="1">one</num> <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> of the value of the increase of all stock raised this year, and <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> of the income of all citizens, corporations and partnerships during the present at year &mdash; may look to some like a heavy tax. It is a pretty heavy burden; but the amount is needed for the defence of the country; and, if I do not mistake the people, will be promptly and cheerfully paid.--Our enemies have already made provision by law for confiscating our estates, and applying the proceeds towards their reckless and wasteful expenditures to secure our subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>If they propose to appropriate to this purpose all we have, in the event of their success, we can certainly afford to spend <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> of <num value="1">one</num> year's income to defeat their wicked attempt. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>We can only approximate the amount by reference to the production of the soil in former years; making reductions in regard to some, and addition in regard to others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>In the case of the cotton crop, it is known that we have a diminished quantity of land in cultivation, and in regard to the corn crop, a greatly increased quantity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>This list shows that the bill will raise some <measure n="70000000dollars" type="currency">$70,000,000</measure>. I suppose the amount will not fall much below, nor greatly exceed, the sum stated.--This sum looks large; but the expenses of the war are necessarily heavy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>We have already incurred a debt, or will have stone so by the <dateStruct value="-01-1"><day reg="1">first</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct> next, of a fraction over <measure n="500000000dollars" type="currency">$500,000,000</measure>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/> So that on the <date value="01-01">1st of January</date> next the circulation in Treasury notes will be over <num value="355000000">three hundred and fifty-five millions</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/> I need not assure the <rs type="place">House</rs> that the present tax bill, or some other similar measure, will have to be adopted to reduce this enormous circulation &mdash; The effect of it upon the <rs>Government</rs> and upon the people will be anything but beneficial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>Money will become too cheap and too plenty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>Prices of everything in market will be enhanced to an extent to correspond with the excess of paper circulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>The Government is obliged to be a large purchaser of everything necessary to the supply of the army, and the great increase of prices, caused by an excess of its own paper, will create a public debt of enormous size.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>Such a state of things will induce habits of extravagance everywhere, without improving the condition of any. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/> It may not be an easy matter to determine what amount of circulation will be required to answer the business and commercial purposes of the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> in the present state of things; but, judging from the past, we may very safely conclude the paper circulation furnished by the <rs>Government</rs> is, and will be, more much more, then is needed, leaving out of view such amount as may be furnished by the banks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>Before the commencement of the war, and before our ports were blockaded, when our annual cotton crops amounted, upon an average, to some <num value="4000000">four millions</num> of bags, and trade and commerce was unobstructed, the paper circulation of all the <name>States</name> now composing the <rs>Confederacy</rs> was much less than at present, and the amount we then had was deemed ample for the business of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>The returns from the banks disclose their entire circulation in <date value="1860-07">July, 1860</date> to have been about <num value="70000000">seventy millions</num>, and their deposits about <num value="50000000">fifty millions</num>; so that, with a diminished commerce, we have now nearly or quite <measure n="3dollars" type="currency">three dollars</measure>, in paper-circulation where we had <num value="1">one</num> in <date value="1860-07">July, 1860.</date> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/> The effect of collecting the proposed tax will be to reduce the circulation to the amount collected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>But the most important question is, can the people pay this amount without serious injury?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>I think they can and will do it. In the first place, the taxpayer after having aided the <rs>Government</rs> to the extent of <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> of his income for <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, finds himself nearly or quite as well off after making the payment as before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>He receives a <num value="0.06">6 per cent.</num> Government bond for the same amount paid in Treasury notes, so that in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instance it is a mere exchange of <num value="1">one</num> description of Government paper for another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>There will be no scarcity of <placeName reg="Treasury">Treasury</placeName> notes with which to pay the tax. If a tax payer is required to pay for the defence of the country <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> of his cotton crop he can sell that <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> and raise the money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>If he is called upon to pay <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> of his tobacco crop, or sugar crop, he can sell <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> and raise the means, and so in regard to the other articles of produce taxed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>The hill provides a fair and just mode of ascertaining the value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>A board of assessors is to be appointed for each State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>This board will, of course assess the value of produce taxed, according to its cash market value were raised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>If a citizen is called upon to pay <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> of his income for <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, he has the income from which to make the payment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>If he has neither produce nor income, he pays no tax. If these views be correct, the bill will oppress nobody &mdash; exact nothing but what is reasonable, and nothing but what is necessary. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/> Under the operation of such a law, we can provide the means of keeping down our public debt, of preventing the depreciation of our Treasury notes, and of preserving the public credit. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/> Our public debt, taking into consideration everything connected with the condition of the country when the revolution commenced, is as small as any <num value="1">one</num> could have expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>It is not more than <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> of the debt admitted to have been incurred by our enemies to carry on thus far their war of aggression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>After the expenditure by the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs> of <num value="2000">two thousand</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num> they have made but little progress towards our subjugation, and most of their progress lately has been backwards. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/> The necessity of passing a tax bill of some description will hardly be denied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>Gentlemen who oppose this, ought, in their opposition, to suggest some better plan <persName n="Lyon,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00108" reg="mostcommon:Lyon,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lyon</surname></persName> said he was ready to adopt any plan shown to posses advantages over the present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>He was willing to prolong the session any reasonable time to insure the passage of a measure so essential.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>His colleague on the committee, (<persName n="Jones,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00109" reg="mostcommon:Jones,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>,) had opposed the bill upon constitutional grounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>His idea was that it proposed a direct tax, and that such a tax had to be apportioned among the several States according to representation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/> <persName n="Lyon,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00110" reg="mostcommon:Lyon,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lyon</surname></persName> could see no constitutional difficulty in the way. Congress possessed the general power &#x0022;to levy and collect taxes.&#x0022; The question as to what was meant by direct taxes was settled in the early history of the old Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>In the case of <persName n="Hilton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00111" reg="mostcommon:Hilton,nomatch:0"><surname>Hilton</surname></persName> vs. the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, reported in the volume of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> decisions, which he had present, it was decided that no objects of taxation embraced in the present bill could constitutionally be the subject of direct the subject of direct taxation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>In the case referred to it was held that lands, slaves and polls, were the only subjects of direct taxation &mdash; The provisions of our Constitution, relating to this subject, are precise copies of the old Constitution, and the reasonable presumption is, that our Convention, in adopting the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, did so with a knowledge of the construction the old <num value="1">one</num> had received. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/> Another gentleman from <placeName reg="Tennessee, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> (<persName n="Foote,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00112" reg="mostcommon:Foote,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Foote</surname></persName>) had assailed the bill upon a different ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>He considers the bill unnecessary, and thinks a simple bill making Treasury notes a lawful tender in payment of debts will cure all the evils, real or apprehended, which may overtake our currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>With such a provision, he thinks, our currency will be self-sustaining.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>In this view of the question, <persName n="Lyon,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00113" reg="mostcommon:Lyon,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lyon</surname></persName> differed widely from the gentleman from <placeName reg="Tennessee, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>He did not believe Congress, under the <rs>Constitution</rs>, had power to make paper a legal tender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>To coin money and regulate the value of coin, does not mean that Congress can coin paper, and regulate the value of coined paper.--But if the power to do this thing existed, <persName n="Lyon,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00114" reg="mostcommon:Lyon,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lyon</surname></persName> though its exercise inexpedient and dangerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>We have yet, as a Government, a character to establish and a credit to acquire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>If we want credit abroad, we must abstain from saying that we have the right to extinguish the indebtedness of the <rs>Government</rs> or our people by the use of paper currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>With the expression of these views, <persName n="Lyon,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00116" reg="mostcommon:Lyon,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lyon</surname></persName> said he left it to the <rs type="place">House</rs> to dispose of the bill as they thought right. </p> </div4> </div3> </div2> </div1>

<head>Underrating an enemy.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/> It is a wise maxim never to underrate an enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>The <rs>North</rs> is beginning to realize the philosophy of that rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>We suppose if ever there was <num value="1">one</num> proposition clearer than another to the <rs>Northern</rs> mind, it was that the <rs>North</rs> could eat the <rs>South</rs> up before breakfast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>No kind of doubt was ever entertained on that subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>Other things might admit of question, and the <rs>Northern</rs> mind, which is greatly given to scepticism, had, in point of fact, questioned almost every other theory and creed received among mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>But that the <rs>North</rs> could whip and wipe out the <rs>South</rs> with its little finger, was a self evident fact, which a man would have incurred the risk of a mad-house for disputing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>It was believed that the <rs>South</rs> existed only by the sufferance of the <rs>North</rs>, which was <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> times greater in wealth, population, and resources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>The Southron, sparsely settled in a vast territory, would have their hands full in keeping down their own negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>The valor of their people was believed to be an impulsive, hot- headed, transient flame; which would soon be quenched when submitted to the cold water bath of Northern determination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>Such was the universal and profound contempt in the <rs>North</rs> of the relative military strength of the <rs>South</rs>, that <persName n="Webb,,James,Watson,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00122" reg="default:Webb,James,Watson,,"><foreName>James</foreName> <foreName>Watson</foreName> <surname>Webb</surname></persName> even proclaimed in his <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Courier and Enquirer" type="newspaper">Courier and Enquirer</orgName></hi> that the <orgName type="regiment" key="NY7">New York 7th regiment</orgName> alone would be able to conquer all the <rs>Southern States</rs>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>Such was the pitch of bloated self sufficiency to which the <rs>North</rs> had arrived, and which had so far imposed upon other nations, that the <rs>South</rs> was everywhere looked upon as the <rs>Ireland</rs> of the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName>. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/> If the <name>Gods</name> sometimes destroy men by granting a foolish prayer, they also sometimes save them by rejecting it. For several years the <rs>King</rs> and people of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> struggled, with all the power of the <rs>Empire</rs>, to subdue the revolted <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> colonies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>They went on till they had accumulated an immense debt, till they had lost their best troops, till they had given a dangerous shock to their own political system, and brought themselves so low that they were obliged to concede legislative independence to <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName> from fear of a mob of hastily raised volunteers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>In vain did the wisest and most illustrious statesmen protest against such madness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>In vain did they ask what was to be done with the colonies in case they were subdued, and whether it was intended to maintain an immense standing army on the other side of the <rs>Atlantic</rs> for the purpose of holding in subjection an unwilling population of the same free blood as ourselves?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>If the remonstrant were not tarred and feathered, or made to ride upon rails, it was only because the full measure of liberty which enables unpopular sentiments to be so promptly dealt with had not then been obtained by an old and somewhat retrograde community. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/> Their remonstrances were given to the winds, and the remonstrant were overwhelmed with ignominy and abuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/><q>&#x0022;What should be done with the rebels when they had been subdued?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>was a question that might be solved when it arose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/><num value="1">One</num> thing was clear &mdash; rebellion must be put down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>The honor of the <name>Crown</name> must be vindicated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>The unity of the <rs>Empire</rs> must be restored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>Till that was done, there could be no thought of peace, and those who desired it were themselves little better than rebels in their hearts.&#x0022;</q> And yet all this time the separation of the colonies, against which we were struggling, was the greatest boon that <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> could bestow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>Regarded in a commercial point of view alone, it was worth more to us than all our conquests put together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>The gain of <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName> has often been rhetorically contrasted with the loss of <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>; but the truth is that the incapacity of <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>North</foreName></persName> and the bungling of his wooden commanders did more for us than the genius of <persName n="Hastings,,Warren,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00289" reg="default:Hastings,Warren,,,"><foreName>Warren</foreName> <surname>Hastings</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>The golden current of trade which began to flow between the <num value="2">two</num> countries when the commercial energies of <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> were set free, very soon repaid as even the immense sums which had been squandered in endeavoring to keep ourselves out of that rich heritage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>Yet, in the wise endeavor to avert from ourselves this good fortune, we had brought ourselves to the brink of destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/><q> &#x0022;We and mankind in general,&#x0022;</q> says a cynical historian, writing of a similar case of blindness, <q>&#x0022;are a set of extremely wise creatures&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/> The refusal of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> colonies to submit to Imperial taxation was a signal given by nature, though not understood by man, that the time had arrived when it was good for both parties that the colonies should become a nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>The present secession of the <rs>South</rs> from the <rs>North</rs> is a similar signal given by nature, and equally misunderstood by man that the time has arrived when there ought to be more than <num value="1">one</num> nation on the <name>Continent</name> of <placeName reg="North America" key="tgn,1000001">North America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>The <rs n="Unionist" type="political">Unionists</rs> imagine that the greatness of their country depends upon the retention under <num value="1">one</num> Government, and under <num value="1">one</num> set of institutions, of the whole of a territory equal to that of all the great nations of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> put together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>But they mistake the nature of greatness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>Greatness is not independent, in the case of nations, of material size and power; but it is essentially a <unclear></unclear> not a material quality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>And in order that she may be morally great, a nation must have other nations at her side to give her the wholesome lessons which, in the case of individuals, man gives to man. America has been like a great blustering boy brought up at home, instead of learning common sense, manliness and modify among his equals in a public school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>She has had nobody to control her tyrannical arrogance, to make her feel her faults, to cure her of that intense self-conceit which is the root of all meanness and of all failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>She has fancied her power unbounded because she has had nobody to measure it against except the decrepit States of <placeName reg="South America" key="tgn,1000002">South America</placeName>, or <name>British</name> colonies still in their leading strings; and she has naturally contracted those wretched habits of bragging and blustering which attend the fancied possession of unbounded power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>She has had before her but <num value="1">one</num> set of political institutions, which she has naturally supposed to be the best imaginable, and she has consequently been led, instead of correcting, to glory in and aggravate all their defects. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/> She has completely carried democracy to the height of an absolute mob rule, in which respectability is a disqualification for political power, and she has seemed to herself all the time to be advancing towards a political perfection hitherto unattained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>Half-a-dozen, independent nations, with different institutions at her side, would have taught her better than this, besides obliging her to have other men than spotting grocers for the officers of her regiments, and to fill her dockyards with something better than rotten wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>The hour of trial has shown her what sort of an education it is to be lord of all you survey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>Her big, burly, hectoring frame turns out no to be tenanted by a big soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>Her natural grandeur is astounding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>Other people's rivers are her brooks, other people's hotels are here Bishops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>What other people do by inches she does by acres; but her troops march home when the cannon are sounding; her officers boast to their men that they are <q>&#x0022;licked into a cocked hat,&#x0022;</q> and her greatest statesman in her extremity is <persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00290" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>Nature is going to cure all this by introducing into the <orgName n="New world" type="newspaper">New World</orgName>, as well as the <rs>Old</rs>, the salutary division of independent nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>And to thwart the beneficent object of nature is the aim &mdash; the hopeless aim &mdash; of this ridiculous war. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
