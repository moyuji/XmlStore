<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> --We republished, from the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> a few days ago, an article which appeared in that paper on the <date value="09-19">19th of September,</date> and of which some portions were so significant that we place them once more before our readers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> is commenting upon a great meeting of operatives, in <placeName key="tgn,7008154" n="1.000 10" reg="lancashire,england,united kingdom,europe">Lancashire</placeName>, for the purpose of taking into consideration the alarming condition of the manufacturing districts, owing to the failure of the usual supply of cotton from the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>It speaks hopelessly of any adjustment between the belligerent parties, and proceeds as follows: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> &#x0022;With all these contingencies looming darkly around us, it is at least a satisfaction to observe, both that the condition of the cotton manufacture is favorable to our present efforts, and that the operatives of <placeName key="tgn,7008154" n="1.000 10" reg="lancashire,england,united kingdom,europe">Lancashire</placeName> are looking at the subject like sensible men. The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> resource in such straits as the present is evidently to limit the rate of <sic>produc-duction </sic>, and this, we are told, can be done not only without much disadvantage to the trade, but with a positive gain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>It is said that production has recently been carried too far, and that the stocks of manufactured goods are everywhere in excess of the demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>In this case it can certainly do no harm to slacken our pace and allow our products to recover their value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Short time in fact would be rather desirable, even if our supplies of material were in no jeopardy at all. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> &#x0022;In the meantime, the operatives have recognized the exigencies of the crisis by unanimous resolutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>They demur, indeed, to the alleged necessity for the reduction of wages but at a large meeting of delegates at <placeName reg="Manchester, Manchester, England" key="tgn,7010477">Manchester</placeName> it was freely admitted that the present scarcity of cotton afforded a well grounded reason for running the mills short time, and thus diminishing the rate of consumption.--Such a view of the case speaks well for the good sense and sagacity of the men. We must face the impending trial as well as we can.--The long expected dearth has now overtaken us. It is a serious matter, but not quite so bad as feared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>We have <num value="2">two</num> resources--<num value="1">one</num> in economy of consumption, the other in the discovery of new supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Both, we trust, will stand us in good stead, while we feel our way to such a position as will exempt us from any future return of the liability.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> We have constantly maintained that a crisis, springing out of the blockade of the <rs>Confederate</rs> ports, and the consequent failure of the <rs>English</rs> manufacturers to receive their usual supply of cotton, was close at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>It was nearer than we had supposed itself to be. The question has already walked down from the parlor and walked into the kitchen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Its discussion is no longer confined to the upper regions of &#x0022;the highest commercial and manufacturing classes; &#x0022; it has been taken up by the operatives themselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> At the very beginning of the difficulty, the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> brings forward its last resource.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>It can hit upon no expedient, but those of reducing the amount of consumption, and opening new sources of supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>It thinks it would be beneficial to commerce, under any circumstances, to try the experiment of short work, since there is already a surplus of manufactured articles on hand Doubtless it would suit the manufacturers very well to get rid of old stocks before creating more; but how would it suit the operatives?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Short work signifies short wages, and short wages signify short allowance of the necessaries of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The wages of the <rs>English</rs> operative, working full time, can hardly keep him alive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>How could he live on half what he now receives?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The view of the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> is a <num value="1">one</num>-sided view, and fails to take in the party most deeply interested, and likely to play the most important part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Yet this is all the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> can propose as a remedy for the approaching distress, except the alternative of opening new sources of supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>We have frequently had occasion to notice the folly with which <name>English</name> journals, <name>English</name> statesmen, <name>English</name> merchants, and <name>English</name> manufacturers cling to this notion; as if <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5000000">five millions</num> of bales of cotton could be brought into existence by the mere fiat of the <rs>Cotton Association</rs>, or a string of energetic resolutions adopted by a Liverpool or <placeName reg="Manchester, Manchester, England" key="tgn,7010477">Manchester</placeName> meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>It was not thus that the inhabitants of the <rs>Southern States</rs> reached their present rate of production.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>They found ready made to their hand, a soil and climate, the best in the world for the culture of cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>They constituted <num value="1">one</num> of the most active, <num value="1">one</num> of the most enterprising, and <num value="1">one</num> of the most intelligent bodies upon the face of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>They had an abundance of black slave labor always at command.--Being such a race, and possessing such advantages by the labor and enterprise of <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure>, they brought the cotton culture up to <num value="4000000.5">four millions and a half</num> of bales.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>We undertake to say that no country which does not answer all these conditions &mdash; which has not a proper soil and climate, an energetic white population, and plenty of black slave labor &mdash; can ever become a great cotton growing country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>It must have them all. <num value="1">One</num> or even <num value="2">two</num> will not do without the rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>The proper soil and climate and the proper white population will not do without the proper black population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>The proper white population and the proper black population will not do without the proper soil and climate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>The proper soil and climate and the proper black population will not do without the proper white population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>In a word, they must all be blended in the utmost harmony before the culture of cotton on the scale of the <rs>Southern States</rs> can be expected to succeed, and in no country upon earth can such an union be found save in the <rs>Southern States</rs> themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>After all, the result can only be reached by the slow and painful progress of <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure>. Can <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> afford to wait so long?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Can she wait <num value="1">one</num> year?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Can she wait <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> from this day?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>If she could have accomplished this result, would she not have done it long ago? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/> It is curious that while, in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, the operatives are discussing the necessity of reducing the consumption of cotton, in the <rs>Southern States</rs> the planters are discussing the policy of omitting to plant any cotton at all next year, if the blockade continues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>A direct issue seems thus to be made up between the producers and the consumers, and we think there can be little apprehension about the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>The Southern people propose to omit the regular planting next year, in order to prevent the accumulation of <num value="2">two</num> crops, which would bring down the price below its proper <hi rend="italics">minimum</hi> They will cultivate the land thus left vacant in cereals, or will turn it into pasture, and will employ themselves in raising stock, sheep, or cattle, or all <num value="3">three</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>These will not afford so much ready money as cotton; but there is this comfort, that there is no traveling for pleasure nowadays, and that few luxuries can be bought at any price, so there is less need than usual of ready money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>But in the meantime the planters and his slaves will live in the greatest abundance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>The sum total of what he will lose by the non-production of cotton; will not exceed his expenses in traveling and luxuries in ordinary times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>How will it be with the consumer, that is, the operative in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, working on short time, and receiving short wages? </p> <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/> On the <dateStruct value="-10-1"><day reg="1">first</day> day of <month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>, there was cotton enough at <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName> to last <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>, at the usual rate of consumptions Putting the mills on <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> work, this supply may be spun out <measure n="6weeks" type="date">six weeks</measure> longer or putting them on half work, it can be made to last <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>In <measure n="5months" type="date">five months</measure> from the present time, then, there will be no <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> cotton in <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Can it be possible that <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5000000">five millions</num> of human beings will be contented to live so long a time on half wages, when whole wages are barely sufficient to sustain life?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>It is not possible, unless the deficiency be supplied directly by the <rs>Government</rs>, and what is to be gained by that?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>In <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> all classes seem to shut their eyes, voluntarily and resolutely, to the approaching condition of affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>They cannot see it, because they will not; or if they do see it. they will not acknowledge it. But the sufferings of the manufacturing population, when they shall have been living on half wages a very few months, will vent themselves in groans so loud, so long, and so threatening, that they must reach the ears of the <rs>Government</rs>. </p> </div3>

<head type="nobreak" rend="smallcaps">War speculations the probable cause of Ruin to Southern manufactures.</head> 
<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/> --The course-which speculations are taking at the <rs>South</rs> in leading articles of trade is curious and to some extent inexplicable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>That the prices of those articles of consumption which are not produced in the <rs>South</rs>, and for which we are dependent on outside markets, should rise, is natural and not at all singular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>But a great many articles of consumption for which the <rs>South</rs> is not dependent upon other regions, and which she herself manufactures in abundance, are rising as rapidly in price as those just alluded to. The fact of such a rise in the prices of articles of Southern production, may be due, and doubtless is due, in many cases to the want of transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>The coast wise trade is broken up, and products which were interchanged between Southern ports by water navigation, have now to be transported wholly by railway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>The extraordinary among of transportation required by Government pre-occupying the railroads, of course the increased transportation required for other goods cannot be accommodated except after much delay, and this circumstance doubtless creates a scarcity of particular products at particular points, enhancing price and placing consumers at the mercy of speculators.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>But this cause of high prices in many Southern products does not exist as to other products, and fails to account for the rise of their prices. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/> Take, for instance, the price of white paper used for newspapers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>The factories procure rags which used to be sent in large quantities to the <rs>North</rs>, at about half the price they had to give before the war. They may have to pay a little more now than then for some of the few simple chemicals they employ in the manufactures of paper; but the enhanced cost of these does not at all equal the saving made in the diminished price of rage used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>Yet paper, which therefore was purchased at <measure n="10cents" type="currency">ten cents</measure> cannot now be had at less than <num value="15">fifteen</num> cent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>There can be no good reason, founded of bound principles of business, for such an addition to the price of this article, and the increased charge can only be accounted for by the propensity of human nature to lighten prevailing pressure, and to make hard time-harder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>If the ports were open, and white paper could be procured from the <rs>North</rs>, the competition of the <rs>Northern</rs> article would keep down the price of the <rs>Southern</rs>; but the <rs>Southern</rs> manufacturers of this, as well as of many other articles, copying the error of the fool in the fable who killed the goose for the golden egg, are forfeiting in advance all chance of a favorable system of permanent legislation in the future for their benefit, by making the very name of Southern manufacturers the synonym of extortion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/> Another striving instance of a needless and causeless advance in the price of a leading article of Southern manufacture is that of cut nails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>Everybody knows that at least the <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> market, if not the greater portion of the <rs>Southern</rs> market, for this article, was supplied by Southern manufacturers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>Yet, the price of nails has gone up in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, the chief seat of the manufacture, from <num value="4.5">four and a half</num> to <measure n="7.5cents" type="currency">seven and a half cents</measure>; and strong speculations are now organizing to raise the price to <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">ten dollars</measure>. There is no sound reason for this rise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>There need be no scarcity of iron in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and we have every factory in operation now that we had, before the war; yet the price of nails will more than double.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>It will not be front an increase of demand, for building is generally suspended by the war. It cannot be front the deficiency of transportation, for that won't tend to glut the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> market; and it is here that the price advances <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and most rapidly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>It is not from deficient supply; for that is the same precisely as before the war. The cause is <num value="2">two</num>-fold; <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, the speculation that have been set on foot in the article, by which fortunes have already been made; and <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, the absence of competition from the <rs>North</rs>, which has tempted manufacturers to put up their prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>The effect of the course of the manufacturers, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in consenting to sell to speculators at all, and then in putting up their own prices in consequence of the success of speculators in running up theirs, must be plain to every <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>The Southern public will be so disgusted at the extortion that is practiced upon them, that, when peace ensues, the ports are thrown open, and manufacturers petition for protection from foreign competition, including that of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, the country will be disposed indignantly to reject their prayer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/> The instances we have cited are but examples of a general rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>The case is worse with woollen and cotton manufactures.--Speculation is rife in every department of trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>Southern manufacturers, instead of discouraging it, are yielding to, and taking advantage of, the state of things.--Southern manufactures of all sorts are held for double prices, and the seeds of popular indignation against them are sowing all through the <rs>Southern</rs> community. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/> We would sound a friendly warning to Southern manufacturers on this important subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>The tendency of the <rs>Southern</rs> mind strongly in favor of free trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>Free trade with <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> will bring in goods after the war so cheap, and so superior to the <rs>Northern</rs> fabrics which they have heretofore been accustomed to, that, once trying it, the <rs>Southern</rs> people will never consent to give it up again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>Protection, even the most moderate, will be infinitively more unpopular in the <rs>South</rs> than it was ever in the old Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>The thought of it will only be tolerated so far as to place us in a state of self-dependence and self protection in time of war; and yet the present course of Southern manufacturers may render them so unpopular that the <rs>Southern</rs> people will prefer to do without their help altogether, as a mean of escaping their extortion. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>Every upland, glade, and glen, for miles, is covered with the white tents of our brave Southern men, and the <rs>Confederate</rs> flag floating freely to the breeze.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>With the beautiful frost-tinted autumn woods for a background, and the ascending smoke of the camp fires, floating like a mist over them, the scene is beautiful beyond description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>At <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName> are the fortifications &mdash; good, substantial affairs, as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> will and to their sorrow it they approach too near.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>The country, never very rich, now presents from <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName> here the most desolate, dreary aspect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/> After leaving the pike, a road through a dense pine wood leads to this encampment &mdash; Of course a lady coming in while on the out-posts was something of a curiosity, and it was soon rumored abroad that there was a lady in camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>It was after the dinner hour when I arrived, but a hearty meal was soon prepared, consisting of bread and butter, sweet potatoes, beefsteak, and coffee; and I partook of my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> meal in camp with quite a relish, after a ride of <measure n="10miles" type="distance">ten miles</measure>, and thinking camp fare not at all bad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>As great many acquaintances and friends, and a good many of the officers called on me, and I soon began to feel quite at home in the tented field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>I was much amused at the culinary department and the cooking arrangements, as I sat watching the preparations for supper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>The huge, camp-fires in front of the tents, with merry groups gathered around, with song and jest echoing from lip to lip; the sentinel, in his lonely path, and the deep notes of the bugle, with its distant echo, were all objects of interest to me. </p>
