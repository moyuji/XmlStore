<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/> In another respect the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> will derive little aid and comfort from the <name>Polish</name> rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>It is <num value="1">one</num> of the vainest of nations, and its vanity has been inordinately fed by the attention it has lately attracted in the civilized world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>It did not much care how it was spoken of, so it was only spoken of. It enjoyed amazingly the sensation its great war was awakening in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and its journals eagerly copied, and its people hungrily devoured every <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> and <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00111" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName> newspaper article which its sayings and doings elicited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>Moreover, when he shall call into the field an army of a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men all <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> understands that it will not be an army in buskram; when he puts down his foot firmly a continent trembles under his tread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>The U. S. have never at any time absorbed much of the attention of mankind, except as the prolific plantation of cotton and tobacco.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>The present war has given it a degree of notoriety which it never before possessed; an evil reputation, it is true, but that was more acceptable to its people than no reputation at all. It must now be content to subside into comparative checurity, and to sink from starring it to becoming a provincial stock actor of inconsiderable celebrity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>The South, which is not fighting for fame, but for life and all that makes life dear, has no reason to be mortified by the sensation which another gallant people, fighting like itself in the cause of national independence, is producing in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>On the contrary, our own hearts are cheered by the inspiring resistance to tyrants which is being roused in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> as well as <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>A nation of whereas may be conquered, but they cannot be kept down.
