<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> The latest papers that we have received from <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,W.,G.,,:1"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> are of last <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time>. They contain nothing of importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The last news from <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> is given by the correspondent of the <hi rend="italics">Appeal,</hi> writing on the <dateStruct value="--19"><day reg="19">19th inst.</day></dateStruct> The following extracts are interesting: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> It is now reliably ascertained that the late movement of <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> was a feint, for the purpose of inducing the <rs>Confederates</rs> to reduce their forces here by sending the troops to points threatened with more imminent danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>I have it also from reliable authority that the reported arrival at <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName> of the greater part of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> was all a ruse, got up for the same purpose of misleading and deceiving our authorities here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Instead of going to <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName> and on up the river, the troops were simply removed from the peninsula opposite <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> to <persName n="Milliken,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Milliken,nomatch:0"><surname>Milliken</surname></persName>'s bond, a distance of not more than <measure n="20miles" type="distance">twenty miles</measure>, and from above the reinforcements are on the way down instead of up the river. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> The officers at this point did wisely in preparing themselves with the means of securing the most accurate information of the enemy's movements, and the result proves that their suspicions were well founded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>How this knowledge was obtained it is not purulent for me to state, but that none of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> is more than <placeName><distance reg="25miles">twenty-five miles</distance> above <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName></placeName> is well established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The inference, therefore, is that his forces are now being concentrated and organized into working order to make the attack at an early day. The affair on the night of the <num value="16" type="ordinal">16th</num> was but the precursor of what was to follow, and if that adventurous expedition had got through safe, there is no doubt but that before this time the struggle for the possession of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> would have commenced. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> It is full believed here that the enemy intends to carry troops across the river below, and to make a demonstration up Big Black to circumvent <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Their movements seem to indicate this, but still it is not definitely known whether this is their design, and we cannot rely with any degree of safety upon conjectures until we are sufficiently posted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>But the supposition is, that the troops will be marched across the peninsula to a place opposite <placeName reg="Warrenton, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2114921">Warrenton</placeName>, and the transports were being sent down to bring them over to this side, which may be probable, but still is not certainly known. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> Since the enemy opened on the city with guns from the battery inside of the leves, on the peninsula, on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, they have kept up a continues shelling at intervals up to the present writing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Commencing about <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time>. A. M., the firing is continued all day, sometime with great rapidity, and than again stacking off, and only a shot after a long interval.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>No damage has yet been done to the city, for the simple reason that the shots all fall short; but they must frighten the catfish mortally, as the shells all drop in the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Their guns must be of heavy calibre, but not of sufficient range to reach the city from the present point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Some few have come into the city, but the greater portion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>and particularly the heavy ones, fail into the river, sometimes not half-way across. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> The raids making by the enemy is <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522"><rs type="direction">North</rs> Mississippi</placeName>, it is supposed, have <num value="2">two</num> objects; <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, to plunder and prevent planting, and, secondly, to produce alarm and tempt off troops from the army defending <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The ruse, however, seems to be understood by our commanders, and will fall of its purpose. </p> </div3>

<head>The mails &mdash; Mail contractors.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> Congress has wicaly exempted these officials, under certain restrictions, from military service, and it is understood that hereafter all such persons will be held to a rigid accountability by the <name>Department</name> for the faithful performance of their duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>It has not escaped the notice of the <rs>Government</rs> or the press that in many remote regions the contractors have subjected the wives and mothers of our galliant soldiers to unnecessary pain and distress of mind by the irregularity of their delivery of public mails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>In some counties of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Southwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName>, and in the <rs>Northern</rs> parts of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, these irregularities have amounted in many cases to insupportable grievances, and the people at large have determined that in future those who enjoy the advantages secured by the possession of these contracts, shall perform their duties, or accept the alternative proposition of being reported to the <orgName n="Post Office Department" type="department">Post-Office Department</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>These grievances were patiently submitted to during last winter; but indolent or speculating contractors need not hope for the same immunity in the future which they have enjoyed in the past, and the corrective will be applied in all cases in which they are reported for neglect of duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>That corrective will be the punishment of the offender by the loss of his contract and the transfer of his name from the civil list to the muster roll of the nearest <placeName reg="Camp of Instruction">camp of instruction</placeName>, in which position he will be able to appreciate, in part, the painful anxiety which our brave soldiers and their families feel in consequence of irregularities in the transmission of the mails. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>A rigorous blockade of the seaports of the <rs>South</rs> was immediately commenced, through which the principal ingredient of gunpowder (saltpetre) had to be largely sucked in.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>For this post <persName n="Raines,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Raines,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Raines</surname></persName> possessed eminent qualifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>He had been professor of chemistry at <placeName reg="West Point, Clay, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057765">West Point</placeName>, and for some years, since leaving the army, he had been at the head of some large iron works at <placeName reg="Newburg, Wyoming, New York" key="tgn,2070735">Newburg</placeName>, on the <rs>Hudson</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/><placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta, in Georgia</placeName>, was selected as the site of the intended mill, and never, both as regards the person and the situation pitched upon, was happier sagacity evinced by the <rs>President</rs>.--Following, so far as he was acquainted with it, the plan upon which the gunpowder mill at Waltham Abboy, belonging to the <rs>English Government</rs>, is built, <persName n="Raines,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Raines,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Raines</surname></persName> proceeded to construct the works necessary for his purpose; and the success which has attended his efforts has been such as could never have been believed before the pressure of war and privation had awakened Southern ingenuity and enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The result is that, at the cost of about &#x00A3;<num value="20000">20,000</num>, <num value="1">one</num> of the most perfect gunpowder mills in the world has been produced, which turns out <measure n="5000l." type="pounds"><num value="5000">five thousand</num> pounds</measure> of powder per day, and could produce double that amount if worked day and night, and much more if worked under the exigency of a pressing demand. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/> The cost of this powder, in spite of the costliness of the saltpetre which has been introduced through the blockade, is about <measure n="4cents" type="currency">four cents</measure> per pound, which is about the same as its cost in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>The mill has now been constantly at work for many months, and consequently more powder than the <rs>Confederacy</rs> in likely to require for years to come has already been produced.
