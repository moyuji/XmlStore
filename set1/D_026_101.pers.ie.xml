<head>Removal of lady clerks.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/> It is certainly well that no orders have yet been issued for the removal to the <rs>South</rs> of any ladies connected with the <rs>Confederate Departments</rs> except those engaged in the signing of Treasury notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>The removal even of those ladies, although it is defended on the ground of convenience &mdash; because the printing of the <name>Treasury</name> notes is done in <placeName reg="Columbia, Richland, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013641">Columbia</placeName> &mdash; will prove to have been of no benefit either to the <rs>Government</rs> or those employed in the signing of notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>That it will subject the young ladies to the greatest inconvenience and to loss is apparent; and as the notes, after being signed, must be sent here before circulated, just as formerly, nothing is gained by the move.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>On the contrary, as the difference will be that the notes will be transported from <placeName reg="Columbia, Richland, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013641">Columbia</placeName> to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, after being signed and ready for circulation, there is the danger of serious loss to the <rs>Government</rs> by robbery of them on the way &mdash; a danger not incurred formerly, since the thief could then only steal unsigned notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>If the measure is injurious to the young ladies, and of no benefit to the <rs>Government</rs>, it subjects the public and the financial department to serious inconvenience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>For a considerable suspension in the preparation of notes is caused, in the midst of the severe process instituted by law of retiring the old issues of the <rs>Government</rs> and substituting the new in their place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>All of the old, save the <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">$5</measure> notes, are banished from circulation, and with the doom of the <hi rend="italics">fives,</hi> in the near future settled by law, they are so depreciated that they practically cease to be a circulating medium.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>And just at this juncture, when public sentiment and action is aiding the <rs>Government</rs> to retire its old currency, we have this interruption of the issue of the new that is to take its place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>The expedient is certainly neither creditable to the consideration nor the wisdom of its author, and we cannot but sympathize with the inconvenience and sacrifices to which this movement has necessarily subjected the ladies hitherto engaged in note signing in this city. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/> The removal of the ladies engaged in other departments of the <rs>Government</rs> is open to such grave objections that we are compelled to doubt whether it was ever seriously contemplated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>If it be the object to relieve <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> of a few <num value="100">hundred</num> mouths that are to be fed here, the injury to the public service and to the common cause is much greater than any benefits to be derived from so inconsiderable a diminution of the number of consumers in this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>The public business in every department would be thrown back for weeks, perhaps months; for not only is the time of transit to the new location to be taken into account, but accommodations and facilities for the transaction of public business have to be absolutely created in the new places to which they are to be sent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>Even in the city of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> it has been found difficult to furnish the material required for the various departments, and how would it be in places of not <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> the size of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, nor a <num value="100" type="ordinal">hundredth</num> part of its manufacturing facilities?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>It is to be observed that the removal, for example, of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num> Auditor's Department would involve the removal of the <rs type="role" reg="Quartermaster-General">Quartermaster General</rs>'s, the <rs type="role" reg="Commissary-General">Commissary General</rs>'s and the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant. General</rs>'s Departments, for these branches are too intimately connected to permit of their separation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>We need not dilate upon the inconvenience &mdash; any more, the extreme peril to the public interest &mdash; of such a step.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>It would be, in fact, the removal of the seat of Government from the city of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>It would be so apprehended by our friends, and our enemies would exultingly proclaim it as the abandonment of the <rs>Confederate</rs> capital!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>It would be difficult to make the world understand it in any different light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>It would give the <rs>Federal Government</rs> and armies that encouragement which they so much need at this critical moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>We can imagine what our own conclusions would be if the <rs>Executive Departments</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> were ordered to be removed further North; and in that way we can understand what would be the conclusions of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> on hearing that the <rs>Confederate Departments</rs> had been ordered farther South. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/> We have not stopped to discuss the individual sufferings that would be the result of such a movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>But as the movement has been put on the ground of humanity, it is a legitimate reply that the removal of ladies to the <rs>South</rs> would cause far more suffering than it would relieve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>Many of them are connected with families who have lost their all and taken refuge in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>. --These families the noble spirited young ladies who have obtained employment in the departments are assisting to support; in not a few cases they are the sole support of aged fathers and mothers and young brothers and sisters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>To send them away is to deprive these families of all that keeps the wolf of starvation from their door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>The prices of board in their new homes would consume the whole of their salaries in the support of <num value="1">one</num> person, whilst here, by taking <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> rooms, they can manage, by strict economy, to support, or help to support, the families with which they are connected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>So that the only alternative presented to them is to resign and starve at home with their families, or to go to the <rs>South</rs> and leave their families to starve behind them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>It is clear enough that such a measure would increase instead of diminish the amount of public suffering. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/> We are therefore glad to hear that the project of removing any more ladies in the public service has been abandoned &mdash; we hope never to be revived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>We say nothing about the honor of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, which is involved in the avoidance of everything that looks like the removal of the seat of Government from the beleaguered city.
