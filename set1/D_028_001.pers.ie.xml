<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The year <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct> has gone with the last year's snow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>It has passed away, and is lost in the ocean of eternity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>It was a memorable year in the history of this continent &mdash; the most memorable, from the gigantic character of the incidents to which it gave rise, that has passed over it since <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> &#x0022;gave a new world to the <name>Kingdoms</name> of <placeName key="tgn,2068373" n="1.000 1" reg="castile, wyoming, new york">Castile</placeName> and <persName n="Leon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Leon,nomatch:0"><surname>Leon</surname></persName>. &#x0022; It may not be uninteresting to our readers to go rapidly over the principal incidents which it witnessed, and which have rendered it forever memorable in the history of mankind. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> We begin with the famous raid of <persName n="Kilpatrick,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Kilpatrick,nomatch:0"><surname>Kilpatrick</surname></persName>, which took place in the latter part of <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> and beginning of <dateStruct value="-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>, and which had for its object the capture of this city, the release of the prisoners, the total destruction of the town, and the murder of the <rs>President</rs> and his Cabinet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>This part of the undertaking was entrusted to <persName n="Dahlgren,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Dahlgren,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Dahlgren</surname></persName>, who seems to have been formed by nature for the execution of the most atrocious schemes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/><persName n="Kilpatrick,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Kilpatrick,nomatch:0"><surname>Kilpatrick</surname></persName>'s forces divided in the upper country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/><num value="1">One</num> portion of them, after having attempted to capture the artillery of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Curtis,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> at <placeName reg="Frederick's Hall">Frederick's Hall</placeName>, and been driven off, came on direct, and made their appearance on the outskirts of the city, where they had an artillery duel with our batteries, without much damage to either side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The other, under <persName n="Dahlgren,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Dahlgren,nomatch:0"><surname>Dahlgren</surname></persName>, passed through <placeName key="tgn,2002163;tgn,2111964" n="0.164 000000.8181	placename;tgn,2002163;goochland, virginia, united states,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.109 000000.5454	placename;tgn,2111964;goochland, goochland, virginia,Goochland,Virginia,United States,North and Central America" reg="goochland, virginia, united states,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;goochland, goochland, virginia,Goochland,Virginia,United States,North and Central America">Goochland</placeName>, robbing and burning as they went.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>They approached the city in a dark night, on the <placeName key="tgn,2114984" n="1.000 10" reg="Westham, Henrico, Virginia">Westham</placeName> road, and within a few miles of town, were met, in a dark night, by the battalion of clerks, who fired not more than <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> volleys at them, when, as was to have been expected from professional house-burners and hen roost thieves, they faced to the right about and galloped off. <persName n="Johnson,General,Bradley,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="default:Johnson,Bradley,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Bradley</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName> had already met a party of them, numbering about a <num value="1000">thousand</num>, with a small force near <orgName n="Old Church" type="church">Old Church</orgName>, in <placeName reg="Hanover, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2112147">Hanover</placeName>, and routed them effectually. --The next night, <persName n="Hampton,General,Wade,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="default:Hampton,Wade,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Wade</foreName> <surname>Hampton</surname></persName>, who had by this time arrived with a body of cavalry, shelled a large body of them, commanded by <persName n="Kilpatrick,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Kilpatrick,nomatch:0"><surname>Kilpatrick</surname></persName> himself, and frightened them so badly that they took to their heels and escaped down the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>. <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> <persName n="Dahlgren,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Dahlgren,nomatch:0"><surname>Dahlgren</surname></persName> was not so fortunate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>He crossed the river into <persName n="King,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:King,nomatch:0"><surname>King</surname></persName> and <rs type="role2">Queen</rs>, and falling into a body of <orgName n="Home Guard" type="militia">home guards</orgName> and militia, was surrounded, in a dark night, and furiously attacked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>He himself was killed on the spot and the greater part of his men taken prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>On his person were found papers which revealed his design to set fire to the city during the night and to inaugurate a general scene of pillage and massacre.--The most ample preparations had been made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Oakum and turpentine had been formed into the most convenient shapes for executing the diabolical purpose.--But death cut short his designs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The next most notable incident was the defeat of <persName n="Banks,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Banks,nomatch:0"><surname>Banks</surname></persName> in <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256"><rs type="direction">Western</rs> Louisiana</placeName> by <persName n="Taylor,,Dick,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="default:Taylor,Dick,,,"><foreName>Dick</foreName> <surname>Taylor</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>This was a most important victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The enemy lost at least <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> men, and would have lost his whole army and the fleet that operated with it but for the want of vigor in following up the blow. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> Next came our successes in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, especially that at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, in which <persName n="Hoke,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Hoke,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hoke</surname></persName> so highly distinguished himself that he was made a major-general for his gallantry. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> We now come to <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s great expedition, the object of which was to overwhelm <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Curtis,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> in the upper country and pass on over his body to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, which he expected to enter without further opposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> papers had said he was to celebrate <date value="07-04">the 4th of July</date> in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, and he seems to have entertained that opinion himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>He crossed the <rs>Rapid Ann</rs> on the <date value="05-04">4th of May</date> with an enormous force &mdash; reckoned at not less than <num value="150000">one hundred and fifty thousand</num> men, in <num value="1">one</num> body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Notwithstanding a great inferiority of numbers, <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Curtis,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> hastened to attack him. The battle lasted <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>, and resulted in our complete success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, whose face was south, and who had proclaimed his determination to fight it out on that line if it took him all summer, was forced to make a move <unclear></unclear> his former line of march, having been utterly unable to drive <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Curtis,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> out of his way. He lost, according to the <rs>Washington</rs> <hi rend="italics">Chronicle,</hi>--the <rs>Government</rs> paper, edited by <persName n="Forney,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Forney,nomatch:0"><surname>Forney</surname></persName>, --<num value="35000">thirty-five thousand</num> men on this occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>As the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, of course, do not speak half the truth on such occasions, we may fairly infer that the loss was at least <num value="60000">sixty thousand</num>, which estimate is rendered probable by the number of small arms picked up by our men--<num value="57000">fifty &mdash; seven thousand</num> in all. <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> wrote a lying dispatch, claiming a victory, at the very time that he was retiring before <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Curtis,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>; while the latter, following him up, drove him out of <placeName reg="Spotsylvania Courthouse">Spotsylvania Courthouse</placeName> and established himself there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Here he was again assailed by <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> on the <dateStruct value="-05-09"><day reg="9">9th</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="-05-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>On the latter day, he sustained a sanguinary repulse, in which he lost <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> men. On the <dateStruct value="--12"><day reg="2">12th</day></dateStruct>, he made a sudden assault upon a portion of our lines which was too far advanced, and, by the suddenness of the onset, routed the <orgName>division of <persName n="Johnson,General,Edward,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="default:Johnson,Edward,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Edward</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName></orgName> and <measure n="2000" type="captured">captured two thousand</measure> prisoners (among them the <rs>General</rs> himself) and all the artillery of the division.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, however, were soon driven off, and the most tremendous battle of the war ensued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Being behind breast-works, our men suffered little, while the slaughter of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> was without a parallel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>We think we may safely put it at <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> men, since they themselves confess to <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The armies remained facing each other for several days; but <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> had enough of it, and would not try a <orgName n="General Assault" type="misc">general assault</orgName> again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Several feeble attempts were made, but his men had lost spirit and could not be brought up to the scratch again.

<head>The land fighting &mdash; Unaccountable Recall of the troops.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/> A correspondent of the <orgName n="New York Times" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> gives an account of the land fighting, of which there appears to have been hardly any at all. The <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 1">first regiment</orgName> that landed was the <orgName type="regiment" key="NY142">One Hundred and Forty-second New York</orgName>, who celebrated the event by &#x0022;<num value="9">nine</num> long and lusty cheers.&#x0022; Another regiment then &#x0022;marched a few yards&#x0022; and captured the <placeName key="possibilities=30" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Flag-Pond</placeName> battery, with <num value="65">sixty-five</num> men. The rest of this laughable conflict is thus described: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/> While this was going on, the <orgName type="regiment" key="142NYRegiment">One Hundred and Forty-second New York regiment</orgName>, having formed on the beach, were marched up in the direction of <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName>. <orgName n="company"><persName n="Winslow,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00153" reg="mostcommon:Winslow,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Winslow</surname></persName>'s company</orgName> was deployed as skirmishers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>These gallant fellows not only marched <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> up a beach that had the full sweep of the guns on that side of <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName>, but they actually took shelter under the guns, charged a redoubt and captured a flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>Not only that, but <num value="1">one</num> of the number crept up to an angle of the fort and shot and killed a mounted orderly who had just passed within the sally port, capturing his mule, and took from him an important dispatch which he was conveying to the commandant from the rebel authorities in <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>That was not all achieved by that gallant regiment on that occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>Soon after arriving at the fort, a company deployed to the right and surprised and captured over <num value="200">two hundred</num> rebels who were marching down a road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>In the meantime, the other regiments of <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Curtis,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00154" reg="mostcommon:Curtis,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Curtis</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>, <orgName type="division" n="division 2">Second division</orgName>, <orgName type="corps" n="corps 24">Twenty-fourth corps</orgName>, landed and formed in line.--This brigade was followed by the <orgName type="regiment" key="3Brigade">Third brigade</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>The entire number of troops that landed did not exceed <num value="3000">three thousand</num> out of <num value="7000">seven thousand</num> on the transports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>At <time value="6oclock">six o'clock</time> in the morning all of the troops, with the exception of nearly <num value="500">five hundred</num>, had been placed again on board of the transports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>The <num value="500">five hundred</num> could not be got off to-day in consequence of the tremendous swell of the sea, which made it utterly impossible for a boat to go to the shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>Such is the result of <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> of fighting and the fiercest bombardment to which any fort or town was ever subjected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>But let us take up the thread of events where my last letter left it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/> As soon as the enemy's infantry had gained a foothold on the mainland, on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time>, the <dateStruct value="--25"><day reg="25">25th instant</day></dateStruct>, they threw themselves across the narrow spit of <unclear></unclear> on the southeastern extremity of which <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName> stands, and thus got between <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Kirkland,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00253" reg="mostcommon:Kirkland,nomatch:0"><surname>Kirkland</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> and the fort, while <persName n="Kirkland,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00254" reg="mostcommon:Kirkland,nomatch:0"><surname>Kirkland</surname></persName> was between them and <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>They moved forward immediately against <persName n="Fisher,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00255" reg="mostcommon:Fisher,nomatch:0"><surname>Fisher</surname></persName>, and attempted to carry it by a <hi rend="italics">coup de main;</hi> but the brave garrison, quitting their guns and taking up their muskets, easily repulsed them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>A <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> assault was made, and with the like result; after which the enemy withdrew up the beach beyond the reach of the <rs>Confederate</rs> fire and went to work entrenching themselves under cover of their protecting fleet.--They made some prisoners among the junior reserves when they advanced down against the fort; but beyond this our less was small, being less than <measure n="50" type="killed and wounded">fifty killed and wounded</measure>. Nearly all of our casualties consist of light wounds, but few having been killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>Among the wounded was the brave <persName n="Read,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00256" reg="mostcommon:Read,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</roleName> <surname>Read</surname></persName>, from <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, of the artillery, whose left arm was torn off near the shoulder by a shell while he was sighting a gun. He was doing well this morning. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/> Another account states that the assaults against the fort were repulsed by the junior reserves of this State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>It is certain that these youthful soldiers have played an important part in the defence of the fort, and have acquitted themselves with much credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>The fleet continued its fire until the infantry were ready to begin the assault, when, at a signal from the shore, every vessel ceased its fire, and the men on the water became spectators of the fight on the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>Very little damage was sustained by the fort, which is probably the strongest earthwork in the wold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>Mortar firing was kept up against the fort throughout the night, doing no injury beyond interrupting the rest of the men. A heavy rain, accompanied by high winds, prevailed all night, and seemed to render the position of the enemy's forces on shore still more precarious. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/> Meanwhile reinforcements, which should have reached here <measure n="60hours" type="date">sixty hours</measure> sooner, began to arrive. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/> The situation, though not desperate, had now become extremely critical; and consequently <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00257" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName> determined to clear the road to <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fisher</placeName> and re-open communications by land with the garrison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>This he succeeded in doing yesterday, as well as in pushing the enemy back upon the beach, where they were huddled together under their fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>I neglected to say that every available man was thrown into <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fisher</placeName> on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, or sent down to <placeName key="possibilities=27" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Sugarloaf Hill</placeName>, on the mainland.--All places of business were closed, and every man who could carry a musket vine sent to the field. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/> It was the situation of the enemy that had now become critical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>Having failed to carry the fort, and having been driven back upon the beach, if a gale should set in the a few days and communication with the fleet be cut off, be must either surrender or perish for want of food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>It is reported that <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00258" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName>, comprehension their condition, ordered them to be should through the night to prevent <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> them from receiving supplies as well as from re-embarking on board their transports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>If such an order was given, it failed to accomplish its object; indeed, if it had any effect, it was only to hasten the retreat of the baffled and beaten foe, who re-embarked last night and this morning, and left the <rs>Confederates</rs> masters of the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>It was impossible to cut off-their retreat, as it was difficult to prevent their landing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>Both their landing and their withdrawal were covered by the fleet, which came in near shore, and was quite as effective in protecting the movement as a large, well-manned fort. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/> Such is the finale of the <name>Christmas</name> campaign of Beast <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00259" reg="nearbymention:Butler,Benjamin,F.,,"><surname>Butler</surname></persName> and <persName n="Porter,Admiral,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00260" reg="nearbymention:Porter,R.,D.,,"><roleName n="Admiral">Admiral</roleName> <surname>Porter</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>It is impossible to say what has been the loss of the enemy.
