<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> I have been purposing to drop you a line for a day or <num value="2">two</num>, but such has been the uncertainty of our movements that it has been almost impossible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> Our regiment has been employed this week in making some very formidable entrenchments in this region, behind which it would be very safe to meet any enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Others are being erected by large bodies of negroes in proper locations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>In <num value="1">one</num> I counted <num value="125">125</num> slaves at work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Some of our regiment, it seems, had come to the conclusion that, as we had helped to erect a formidable fort, it would be our pleasant duty to defend it. But this will not be the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/><num value="1">One</num> thing is certain and satisfactory, that the men who will defend it will be worthy of the place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>There is but <num value="1">one</num> spirit that animates us all. We will try to die cheerfully, if necessary, in defence of our parents and sisters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Such is the strength of the conviction upon all minds that ours is a righteous cause, that no man seems scarcely to think of a defeat. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> Our regiment come here from <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName> on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The march was fatiguing, but borne without a murmur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>We left <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName> at <time value="2am">2 A. M.</time> I visited <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName> <num value="10">10</num> or <measure n="12years" type="date">12 years</measure> ago and examined its defences, but not with the same interest as on yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Be not uneasy about us if a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> battle of <q>&#x0022;<placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>&#x0022;</q> shall be fought presently. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> It made my blood almost boil a day or <num value="2">two</num> ago when I met <num value="50">fifty</num> or more wagons, carriages, and all sorts of vehicles, bearing old age and infancy, as fugitives from their dear homes How long shall we suffer this?--Though slow to take vengeance, nevertheless the day of vengeance will assuredly come. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> We are pleasantly situated in some respects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>It does <num value="1">one</num>'s soul good to stand upon the truly noble <persName n="York,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:York,nomatch:0"><surname>York</surname></persName>, and drink deep down into his lungs the fresh, invigorating air that comes across its waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Then the fish and the oysters!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>I believe all our men are fattening. --Certainly most of them are. We have had very bad quarters, but to-day they have been very satisfactorily exchanged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The house just vacated, and from which I, as the last man to quit, now write you, is about <measure n="800squarefeet" type="area"><measure n="40feet" type="distance">40</measure> by <measure n="20feet" type="distance">20 feet</measure></measure>, <num value="1">one</num>-story high, with a small garret-- It has also a cellar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>It is occupied thus: In the cellar <num value="70">70</num> negroes engaged upon some heavy work; in <num value="1">one</num> of the principal rooms above, some carpenters, and in the other room and the garret are the <num value="72">72</num> members of the <rs>Life Guard</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> Your correspondent, night before last, preferred to occupy <num value="1">one</num> of the open wagons, with <num value="3">three</num> of the men, rather than in <num value="1">one</num> of the crowded rooms, and he has not yet repented of his choice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>He slept pretty well until summoned at <time value="3:5am">3&#x00BD; A. M.</time> to <q>&#x0022;march.&#x0022;</q> Last night, the wagons not being on hand, I sought for the hospital recently occupied by <num value="2">two</num> of our men, (now well,) and slept admirably.-- It is a smoke-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>When I entered it last night with a light, camp-stool and <hi rend="italics">Dispatch</hi> in <num value="1">one</num> hand, and my bed in the other, it had but <num value="1">one</num> aperture, and that was, of course, the door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>It is but <measure n="120squarefeet" type="area"><measure n="10feet" type="distance">10</measure> by <measure n="12feet" type="distance">12 feet</measure></measure>, and was rather close with the door closed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Before I arose, however, a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> opening was made just above my head by some negro men who were in search of kindling wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/> <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> I commenced a letter to you in a strain but poorly suited to its abrupt termination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>In camp there is very little recognition of the <name>Sabbath</name> day, and in place of the sweet chimings of the church bells, calling to the house of prayer, the sound of the pick and spade, wielded by more than <num value="500">five hundred</num> men, was heard about the entrenchments, to which I alluded in my last, and instead of the solemn invocation, <q>&#x0022;let us pray,&#x0022;</q> the command, <q>&#x0022;fall in for guard,&#x0022;</q> summoned nearly half of the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 1">First Regiment</orgName>, now left in the camp, to that decidedly unpleasant duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>In response to this call, I was forced to bring my letter abruptly to an end, being detailed for &mdash; as I consider it &mdash; the most disagreeable and unsafe of all sentinel duty, <orgName n="Picket Guard" type="guard">picket guard</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/> Irksome and trying, however, as are those duties, no exercise of authority is necessary, or even thought of, to insure their performance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>The men, <num value="1">one</num> and all, work with alacrity, and when the comparative ease in which the majority of those who fill our ranks have been reared is considered, their patient endurance is indeed a matter of wonder, and cannot fail, under the providence of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, of its reward in the success of a cause as holy as ever engaged the energies of man. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>Be this as it may, it is plain what a great revolution railroads have effected in the movement of troops. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/> They have enabled the <rs>North</rs> to concentrate their numerous forces very rapidly on our frontiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>Steamboats have served them fully as well as railroads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>These great agencies of locomotion have effected wonderful things in military transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>But for them, the <rs>North</rs> could scarcely have concentrated a force upon our borders in sufficient bodies and with sufficient rapidity to outnumber the forces with which <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> alone could have confronted them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/> 0But this advantage must cease now that they have touched our shores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>The river which reach up into interior <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> are lined with batteries that will drive back their vessels; and our railroads, even if they should get possession of them, would be rendered impassable to their troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>They can only penetrate into our interior afoot, and the time requisite to make their marches on foot will enable us to oppose very formidable obstacles to their progress. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/> They are almost without cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>We are superabundantly provided with that arm. It seems plain that this decided advantage must quite neutralize any disproportion of force they may bring against us. They must march in compact column.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>Having no cavalry, they can forage little, and will have to leave a strong guard to protect their line of communication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>Their line of march must be as much as possible near the shores of the water-courses in order that their vessels may bring along their supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>Large numbers of ill-drilled soldiers are not a very fit sort of force for invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>They require a fecund and cumbrous commissariat, and they are not likely to state compact and firm under attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>They would be terribly annoyed by guerilla surprises, and would be very easily demoralized and panic-stricken by an enterprising and indefatigable foe. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/> In short, it seems to us that our invader have only just entered upon the serious work before them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>Without cavalry, raw and undisciplined, unused to the camp or to the march obliged to move on foot, obliged to carry their commissariat with them, with many mouths to feed, and likely to be harassed industriously by a fierce and enterprising enemy &mdash; we think they will find that it is easier to get to the borders of the <rs>South</rs> than to penetrate the interior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>Certain it is that they have not yet learned what it is to invade the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>So far, they have contented themselves with sending bodies of men into our disaffected districts; but even in these cases they have confined themselves to the lines of the railroads, along which they have been certain of their ability to support their incursions with unlimited numbers of rein forcements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>Like boys untaught to swim, they have hugged the bank or only ventured into the shallows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>They have nowhere, as yet, plunged into the deep waters. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/> It still remains a problem to be solved, whether they can invade the <rs>South</rs> in the real sense of the term invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>We subscribe to the negative of the problem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>With regular, veteran forces, trained to the duties of the camp, the march and the field, and with a large complement of cavalry and of <orgName n="Flying Artillery" type="artillery">flying artillery</orgName>, it is possible that a column of <num value="50">fifty</num> or <num value="60000">sixty thousand</num> picked men could penetrate to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and into the interior of our country, and have their way with us for a short time; though, as we have heretofore shown, this has never yet been done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/><name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty's</name> subjects are warned <q>&#x0022;not to break any blockade lawfully and actually established by either of the belligerent powers.&#x0022;</q> Now, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> question I wish to but to the noble <rs>Earl</rs> is in what sense we are to understand these expressions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>We are at present under an obligation to adhere to the declaration on the subject of maritime law agreed to by <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> Plenipotentiaries and those of other Powers at <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>That declaration bears directly on the subject of blockades in these words:--<q>&#x0022;Blockades, in order to be binding, must be effective &mdash; that is to say, maintained by a force sufficient really to prevent access to the coast of the enemy.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/> Now, if these words are to be understood in their strictly literal signification, to establish a lawful blockade would be almost physically impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>They must receive certain qualifications and explanations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>I say impossible, because there is hardly in the whole universe only locality in which ships can remain safely with the power of absolutely preventing access to an enemy's beast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>Blockades are carried on by ships at sea. They must be carried on by ships at sea, and under sail, because no ships can carry a sufficiency of coal to enable them to act constantly under steam; no doubt it would be a great facility if they could always fict under steam; that would no far to enable them to make the blockade effectual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>But I recollect having heard that during the blockades of <placeName reg="Toulon, Stark, Illinois" key="tgn,2030419">Toulon</placeName> the ships employed in that service were driven to the <name>Mediterranean</name> and the coast of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>Such things will occur again, and, according to the strict meaning, a blockade might have ceased to be valid because it ceased to be really maintained to prevent access to the enemy's coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>But I apprehend the words must be understood with necessary qualifications; arising from the circumstances of wind, and weather, which command all such operations, and that the real meaning is to prevent access by establishing such a case of danger to those who attempt to violate the blockade as to induce them to desist from attempting to do so. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/> But if that be the meaning of <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> ministers, I <unclear>couless</unclear> I think it very much to be regretted that, instead of adopting totally new words, as they have done in this proclamation, they did not warn <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> subjects against breaking, or endeavoring to break, a blockade lawfully established and effusively maintained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>I wish, then, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to know from the noble <rs>Earl</rs> in what sense we are to understand the words used in this proclamation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>Do they intend to convey the exact meaning, with the qualifications I have mentioned, of the declaration made by the <name>Powers</name> ? If they do not, what further meaning do they contain ? Do they go below or beyond the words of that declaration ? And why should not the particular words there used be adopted on this occasion ? I confess I very much regret to see so much vagueness in the expression used as to <q>&#x0022;contraband of war.&#x0022;</q> The proclamation speaks of <q>&#x0022;arms, military stores or materials, or any article or articles considered and deemed to be contraband of war, according to the law or modern usage of nations.&#x0022;</q> How are plain men to find out what articles have of late been considered contraband of war by the usage of nations ? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/> They must look through all the recent decisions of Courts of Admiralty jurisdiction, not only in this country, but in others; and it is highly probable that they will be found conflicting with <num value="1">one</num> another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>I wish, therefore, to know what are the further articles not mentioned to which it is intended that the proclamation should apply, and which <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> subjects are cartoned not to carry upon the sea. The law with respect to contraband of war is in a state of constant change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>It must change year after year, according as the manner of conducting war is changed.--When I looked into this matter <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure> ago I recollect to have found in the law books of best authority that all these changes were controlled by <num value="1">one</num> prevailing principle, viz: <sic>that that</sic> is contraband of war which, in the possession of an enemy, would enable him better to carry on war. That is a clear, reasonable and intelligible principle and I very much regret that, instead of using the words which I find in this proclamation, <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> ministers did not go back to a principle which all can understand, and which is not affected by changes in the mode of carrying on war. [Hear, hear.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/> <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Granville</foreName></persName>.--The questions put by the noble <rs>Earl</rs> are certainly very important.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>I feel it a somewhat difficult matter to speak upon questions of international law; but, at the same time, it is my duty to give the noble <rs>Earl</rs> all the information I can, and if I should happen to make a mistake I shall be grateful to learned Lords on either side to correct it, in order that no misapprehension may go abroad on a subject of so much importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>With respect to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>What meaning is to be attached to the words <q>&#x0022;a blockade lawfully and actually established ?&#x0022;</q> I apprehend that, although the agreement of <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00088" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName> is likely to form an epoch in the history of international law, and although it was concurred in by all the nations of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> and by several <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> States, yet it does not in itself constitute a change in international law, excepting as regards those Powers which signified their acceptance of it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/> I believe, further, even with respect to those countries which entered into that agreement with us, that what took place at <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> made no change as far as blockades, lawfully and actually established, are concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>That question of international law remains exactly the same as before, with this difference only, that mere paper blockades will not in future be recognized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>Before a blockade can be said to be lawfully and actually established, it must be announced in proper form and manner, and the <rs>State</rs> declaring it must have on the spot such a force as, I do not say to make it impossible, but at any rate to make it very difficult for vessels to obtain egress or ingress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> question which the noble <rs>Earl</rs> has put to me is still more difficult to answer in a clear and satisfactory manner, but I can say, at all events, that the government have followed the course usual on such occasions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/> To a certain extent, the noble <rs>Earl</rs> answered his own question; for he stated that what is contraband of war must vary from time to time, according to the character of the war which is carried on. There are certain articles which are clearly contraband of war; but there are certain other articles, the character of which can be determined only by the circumstances of the case; as, for instance, the ports for which they are destined, and various other incidents which can be properly judged of only in a <orgName n="Prize Court" type="court">Prize Court</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>The decisions of such Court, unless there has been a flagrant violation of international law, all those who have recognized the rights of the belligerents must accept.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>I think, therefore, that <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> Government, in adhering strictly to president in this matter, took the only course which it was possible for them to pursue. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/> The <rs>Earl</rs> of <persName n="Derby,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00089" reg="mostcommon:Derby,nomatch:0"><surname>Derby</surname></persName>.--The answer of the noble <rs>Earl</rs> is, for the most part, entirely satisfactory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>I do not feel disposed to complain that the terms of the proclamation are vague and uncertain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>It is impossible to introduce into a proclamation of this description such a definition of the character of a blockade, or of contraband of war, as would satisfy the conditions which seemed to be laid down by the noble <rs>Earl</rs> who <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> addressed the <rs type="place">House</rs>. --Nor do I complain of the proclamation on the ground that the warning it gives goes beyond the necessities of the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>I refer to the warning which is given to <name>British</name> subjects against taking part in privateering expeditions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>The proclamation wisely and properly informs the subjects of <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty</name> that if they should engage in privateering expeditions they would have no right, whatever might be the result, to claim the protection of this country against any penal consequences to which they might render themselves liable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/> I do not complain of that &mdash; quite the contrary; but there are <num value="2">two</num> points upon which it is absolutely necessary that <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> Government should lose no time in coming to a thorough understanding with the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is with regard to the question of blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>It has been stated that the <rs>Northern States</rs> have intimated their intention of blockading the whole of the <rs>Southern</rs> ports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>Now, we know perfectly well that it is not in the power of the <rs>Northern States</rs>, if their navy were <num value="3">three</num> times as powerful as it is, effectually to blockade all these ports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>There is no doubt they might effectually blockade this or that, or the other port, and that would be a blockade which we should be bound to recognize; but I do think it very important that <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> Government should not commit themselves to the doctrine that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> are to lay down the principle of a universal blockade; that <sic>that</sic> universal blockade would be recognized by <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> Government, and that all <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> Government, and that all <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> subjects who might choose to disregard it would be liable to penal consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>[Hear, hear.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/> I apprehend that to make them so liable the blockades must be <num value="1">one</num> the validity of which has been recognized by their Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>It is important therefore, that <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> Government should come to a clear understanding with the <rs>Government</rs> of the united <milestone unit="culumn" n="5"/> State that a more paper blockade, or a blockade extending over a space to which it is physically impossible that an effectual blockade can be applied, will not be recognized as valid by this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>[Hear. hear.] The other point is <num value="1">one</num> of, perhaps, still greater importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>A noble and learned <rs type="role2">Lord</rs> was understood to say a few days ago that by the law of nations privateering was piracy, and that, consequently, the <rs>Northern States</rs> would be perfectly justified in carrying out their threat to treat all privateering as piracy, and visiting it with capital punishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>I apprehend that if there is <num value="1">one</num> thing clearer than another, it is that by the law of nations privateering is not piracy &mdash; that no enactment on the part of any <num value="1">one</num> nation can make that piracy as regards the subjects of another country which is not piracy be the law of nations, or by the law of that country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/> The Northern States, therefore, must not be allowed to entertain the opinion although it may be right that we should warn <name>British</name> subjects that if they should engage in privateering expeditions they will not be entitled to claim the protection of their Government &mdash; that they are at liberty no to Strain the law as to convert privateering into piracy and visit it with wealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>The punishment, under such circumstances, of persons entitled to <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> protection, would not be viewed with indifference, but would receive the most serious consideration by this country it is right on the <num value="1">one</num> hand that the people of this country should no <unclear>wained</unclear> of the peril of engaging in privateering undertakings; but it is essentially necessary, on the other, that the <rs>Northern States</rs> should not be induced to rely upon our forbearance with regard to a violation of the law of nations by visiting privateering with a penalty which is not attached to it by that law. [Hear.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/> It is said that the <rs>Northern States</rs> treat the <rs>Southern Confederation</rs>, not as having the rights of belligerent, but as rebels, whose acts will be visited with all the penalties of high treason, including capital punishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>But that is not a doctrine we omit, because we have declared that the <rs>Southern States</rs> are entitled to the rights of belligerents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>The Northern States, on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, cannot be entitled to claim the rights of belligerents for themselves; and on the other, to treat the <rs>Southern States</rs>, not as belligerents, but as rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>These are the <num value="2">two</num> points upon which it is most desirable that a clear understanding should be come to between <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> ministers and the <rs>Government</rs> of the <orgName type="regiment" n="US1">United States--first</orgName>, that we cannot recognize any except a really effective blockade, such as the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> may be able to enforce; secondly, that we cannot recognize the doctrine that by any proclamation or any enactment the <rs>Northern States</rs> have power as against the <rs>Southern States</rs> have power as against the <rs>Southern Confederation</rs> to treat privateering as piracy, and to visit it with death. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/> <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Brougham</foreName></persName> heartily wished that all privateering were piracy by the law of nations, but, unhappily, it was not. His opinion on this point had been misunderstood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>What he said was that privateering undertaken by the subjects of <num value="1">one</num> country against the trade of another country, with which their own was at peace, amounted to piracy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>Privateering, however much it might be reprehended, was undoubtedly, in the case of recognized belligerents, not piracy according to the law of nations, as that law was at present understood and administered, but, it any persons subjects of this country, fitted out a vessel against another country with which we were at peace, that, in itself, constituted a piratical act, and he was clearly of opinion that the persons so acting would have only themselves to blame, if, after full warning, they entered upon that course. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/> Taking into account the great changes and improvements in all the appliances of war fare which had of late years taken place, he should hold that coal might be looked upon as amounting to contraband of war, if furnished to <num value="1">one</num> of the belligerents to be used in warfare against the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>He might add that he entirely concurred in the opinion that it was not is necessary that a blockade, in order to be looked upon as effective, should be of such a nature as to render access to any part of the coast impossible, but that it would be sufficient to constitute it a real blockade, that it precluded the existence of any reasonable chance of entrance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/> <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Chelmsford</foreName></persName> said he wished to bring the opinion to which his noble and learned friend had given expression to a test.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>The Confederated States of <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> were admitted by <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> Government to be entitled to exercise the rights of a belligerent power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>That being so, he should wish to know from his noble and learned friend whether he meant to contend that if an English ship were commissioned by these States and fitted out as a privateer against the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, her crew would, under such circumstances, be guilty of piracy ? <name>British</name> subjects so engaged would, no doubt, be answerable to the laws of their own country, but it was perfectly clear that, in accordance with the principles of international law, they would not be liable to be treated as pirates. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/> That warning should be given to <name>English</name> seamen by means of the proclamation was, of course, a most useful and necessary step, and if, after that warning, they would engage in such expeditions as those to which he was referring, they must, of course, take the consequences of their conduct. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/> The <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Chancellor</foreName></persName> said his noble friend, the <rs>President</rs> of the <name>Council</name>, had laid down the law on the point at issue with perfect correctness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>If, after the publishing of the present proclamation, any <name>English</name> subject were to enter into the service of either of the belligerents on the other side of the <rs>Atlantic</rs>, there could be no doubt that the person so acting would be liable to be punished for a violation of the laws of his own country, and would have no right to claim her protection to shield him from any consequences which might arise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>There could, however, at the same time, be no doubt that he ought not to be regarded as a pirate for acting under a commission from a State admitted to be entitled to the exercise of belligerent right, and carrying on what might be called a <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics"><persName n="Justus,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00090" reg="mostcommon:Justus,nomatch:0"><surname>Justus</surname></persName> bellum.</hi></foreign> Anybody dealing with a man under those circumstances as a pirate, and putting him to death, would, he contended be guilty of murder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>[Hear, hear] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/> <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Kingsdown</foreName></persName> said he supposed the <rs>Federal Government</rs> deemed itself justified in publishing the extravagant order in reference to privateering, which it had issued, inasmuch as <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> had insisted upon maintaining the right of resorting to that mode of warfare, when it had been abandoned by the great Powers of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>In the present case, the issue of the order was, no doubt, based on the ground that the <rs>Federal Government</rs> was dealing with rebels, who might be hung as persons guilty of treason to the <rs>State</rs> of which they were subjects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>That was a matter for their own consideration, but he could not help thinking that to act upon such a view would be to have recourse to a piece of barbarity which would raise an outcry throughout the whole civilized world.--[Hear.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/> He trusted, therefore, the order in question was a mere <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">brutum fulmen,</hi></foreign> upon which it was not intended to act. Be that, however, as it might, the case assumed a different aspect when looked on with reference to the position of <name>English</name> subjects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>This country has recognized, not as an independent Power, but as a body possessing the rights of a belligerent, the <name>Confederation</name> of the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>Therefore, they were treated as having power to issue a regular authority for privateering; but the principle as against <name>British</name> subjects established by the proclamation, was that if they chose to engage in privateering, and so act in violation of the orders of their own Government, they should not have the right to call upon the <rs>Government</rs> to interfere for their protection. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/> <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Brougham</foreName></persName> trusted that all persons would take notice of the warning given in the proclamation, that in the event of interfering in the differences prevailing in <sic>Amreica, </sic> they must run the risk of whatever measures might be adopted by the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> on <num value="1">one</num> side or the other, [hear, hear,] just as in the case which occurred <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> ago, <num value="2">two</num> <name>English</name> subjects were tried and hanged for piratical interference on the land, and not on the sea, and not <num value="1">one</num> step was taken to protect or avenge them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/> The <rs>Earl</rs> of Elleuborough feared very much that a good deal of what had passed that night would tend to diminish the apprehension of those disposed to engage in the privateering which had been alluded to. He hoped it would not have that effect, because he was sure that long before the diplomatists could terminate their correspondence the men so interfering and captured would be hanged. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>There was a great variety of opinions entertained and expressed throughout the day concerning the return of the <num value="7" type="ordinal">Seventh</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>Some persons of very filter views were extremely wroth at the bare idea that the regiment should come home at the moment when the war promises to open in real earnest, and while other regiments that had enlisted for the same terms as the <num value="7" type="ordinal">Seventh</num> have been left to bear the brunt of the conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>The great majority of opinionists took a more just and reasonable view of the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>They answered all objections to the return of the <name>Regiment</name> by the argument that the <num value="7" type="ordinal">Seventh</num> had no voice in the matter at all that they were disciplined soldiers under command, whose duty is not to question, but to execute orders; that in the whole course of their military existence they have never been guilty of any act of insubordination or contempt of official orders; that they were the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to move for the defence of the <rs>National Capital</rs> when it was threatened by an overwhelming force; and that they did not hesitate, when they were ordered, to march at short notice and with scarcely any support, to throw themselves into the <name>Breach</name> for the defence of the flage of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>But not with standing all that could be said by the friends of the regiment &mdash; and their hame is legion &mdash; there was a spirit of discontent apparent in almost every direction, especially among a portion of the <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> element of the population, who seem to think it very hard that so many of their friends should be left to right the battles of the country, while an exception has been made in favor of the <num value="7" type="ordinal">Seventh</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>These opinions were very freely exchanged all day; and as the time for the arrival of the regiment drew nearer, the partizans she came more numcrolls, and some rather active debates ensued, which of course are not worth a passing record Some threats at hissing and stoning the men were made, and persons even said that large purchases of eggs had been made for the purpose of assault, but the good sense of the people eventually prevailed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/> The arrival and reception of the <num value="7" type="ordinal">Seventh</num> at the <orgName n="Great Railroad" type="railroad">great railway</orgName> depot in <placeName reg="Jersey City, Hudson, New Jersey" key="tgn,7013813">Jersey City</placeName> was a splendid ovation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>Long before the train had arrived the immense galleries were filled with ladies and gentlemen of the principal families; and the <orgName n="Stars and Stripes" type="newspaper">Stars and Stripes</orgName> were displayed conspicuously from every part of the depot It resembled a great amphitheater, so densely was it crammed with spectators assembled to welcome the members of the corps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>The <persName n="Jackson,,John,P.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00093" reg="default:Jackson,John,P.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, the largest of the ferry boats, was specially set apart for conveying the regiment across the ferry to New York. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/> The <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> trains arrived precisely at <time value="4:30oclock">half-past 4 o'clock</time> P. M., and their approach to the entrance of the depot was the signal for a burst of enthusiasm similar to that which greeted the <num value="7" type="ordinal">Seventh</num> on its departure for the seat of war. On nearing the ferry entrance, and as the men defiled out of the cars, the waving of hats and handkerchiefs, combined with the deafening plaudits of the crowd, were of a nature which fully indicated the great popularity of the regiment, and the high esteem in which it is held.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>Such an ebullition of feeling on the part of the inhabitants of <placeName reg="Jersey City, Hudson, New Jersey" key="tgn,7013813">Jersey City</placeName> carried with it its own index. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/> Some time was taken up in the regiment defiling off into its regular companies, and while this was going on the enthusiasm of the congregated <num value="1000">thousands</num> could not be restrained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>Having ranked up into <num value="3">three</num> deep they marched from the platform in this order to the <rs>John P. Jackson</rs>; and had authorities and the city police, serious accidents might have occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>Every landing place was filled to suffocation, and the protection walls of the different piers were througed to such an extent that it is miraculous that some very indiscreet parties were not thrown into the river or otherwise injured. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/> The arrival of the regiment at the foot of <address><street n="Cordandt street">Cordandt street</street></address> was soon made known to the public, and an immense crowd assembled to see them prepare for their march Some time was consumed in the landing and forming of the men, and in the exchanges of cordial greetings between them and their numerous military and non-military friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>These preliminaries having been settled, the escort of the <num value="7" type="ordinal">Seventh</num> moved on, followed by the detachment of the <rs>Sickles Brigade</rs>, after which came the gallant <num value="7" type="ordinal">Seventh</num> themselves On moving away from the ferry house they were greeted with many loud and generous cheers, which clearly showed that there was something like true appreciation of their conduct in the great heart of the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>The march up <address><street n="Cortiandt street">Cortiandt street</street></address> was a continuation of the ovation so thoroughly begun in <placeName reg="Jersey City, Hudson, New Jersey" key="tgn,7013813">Jersey City</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>On the <dateStruct value="--1"><day reg="2">first</day></dateStruct> of the escort arriving at the corner of the street where it connects with <persName n="Broadway,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00094" reg="mostcommon:Broadway,nomatch:0"><surname>Broadway</surname></persName>, the chimes of old <placeName reg="Trinity, Texas, United States" key="tgn,1131032">Trinity</placeName> pealed out its merry music.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/> At the <rs type="place">Astor House</rs> the <name>Regiment</name> halted, and was drawn up in line to allow the escort of the <orgName type="regiment" key="7ReserveCorps">Seventh Regiment Reserve Corps</orgName> and the battalion of the <rs>Sickles Brigade</rs> to pass through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>The front presented was magnificent, and the man&#x0152;uvres were applauded enthusiastically.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>Some of the volunteers stationed at the <rs type="place">Park barracks</rs> congregated at the lower end of the <rs>Park</rs> and endeavored to deride the regiment by groaning, but all their efforts proved fruitless, as the assembly about the <rs type="place">Astor House</rs> cheered with such vehemence as to drown all demonstration of disapprobation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>In connection with this it must be mentioned that the volunteers, much to their discredit, had provided themselves with potatoes, apples, bits of wood and other missiles, with the expressed intention of pelting the men of the <num value="7" type="ordinal">Seventh</num>--a threat they might have carried out but for the promptitude of <persName n="Green,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00096" reg="mostcommon:Green,Duff,,,:1"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Green</surname></persName>, who is always on duty at the <rs type="place">Park Barracks</rs> and other officers, who gave instructions to the guard to fire at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> man caught throwing a missile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>This decisive conduct caused the men to back down; but nothing could prevent them from hissing and groaning at the <num value="7" type="ordinal">Seventh</num>, and calling out in vile language to some of the soldiers who passed nearest to their quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>This, and the case of <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> rowdies who hissed the regiment in <address><street n="Fulton street">Fulton street</street></address>, are about all the opposition the <num value="7" type="ordinal">Seventh</num> met in <placeName key="tgn,2110813" n="1.000 2" reg="broadway, rockingham, virginia">Broadway</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/> After halting in front of the <rs type="place">Astor House</rs>, as stated, the escort again advanced up <placeName key="tgn,2110813" n="1.000 2" reg="broadway, rockingham, virginia">Broadway</placeName> &mdash; a number of boys dressed in Zouave costume, accompanying the <orgName type="regiment" key="7ReserveCorps">Seventh Reserve Corps</orgName>, and looking very gay. The ladies seemed to be particularly pleased with the <q> &#x0022;young ideas learning how to shoot.&#x0022;</q> The Sickles Battalion showed a firm and manly front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>The men are of the right sort &mdash; upright, thick set fellows, strong in limb and steady on their pins, and looking like true fighters as much as any volunteers we have seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>The officers were all in uniform, but without swords, <persName n="Sickles,Brigadier,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00097" reg="mostcommon:Sickles,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Brigadier">Brigadier</roleName> <surname>Sickles</surname></persName> marching at their head, and prominent among the others was <persName n="Hall,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00098" reg="mostcommon:Hall,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Hall</surname></persName>, of the <rs>Jackson Regiment</rs>, who is <num value="1">one</num> of the best officers of the brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>The march of the <num value="7" type="ordinal">Seventh</num> from this point to the armory was not varied by any very remarkable incidents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>They were cheered all along the route, not mildly nor enthusiastically, but kindly and in the true spirit of a genial welcome home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>On arriving at the armory a large crowd was assembled there, and the regiment marched into their quarters amid their genial acclamations. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>The appearance of the <num value="7" type="ordinal">Seventh</num> as a regiment is what it has always been &mdash; an impersonation, so to speak, of high discipline and military regularity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>The men appeared considerably sunburnt from their exposure to the heat of a Southern sun, to which so few of them have hitherto been accustomed: and from the continual drill and exercise to which they have had to submit, many of them have been considerably reduced in their corporeal dimensions, perhaps to the advantage of their muscular development.--On the whole, the regiment has not suffered in any material degree by its sojourn in camp of war, amid the daily recurrence of alarms and hair-breadth escapes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>The whole regiment is ready at the command of the authorities, at any day and hour again, to do their duty to their flage and to their country, as they have always done, and more than this cannot justly or fairly be expected of any regiment in any service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>The officers and men are content in the conviction that they have done their duty in the way in which the <rs>Government</rs> &mdash; who are the best judges &mdash; have thought best; and, temporarily resting on their laurels and their arms, they may console each other, for any petty spite evinced against them, in the words of <foreign lang="lat"><persName n="Cato,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00099" reg="mostcommon:Cato,nomatch:0"><surname>Cato</surname></persName> to Sompronlus</foreign>: </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="939"/> You may have observed the ruins of an old castle, about half a league hence, on the road to <placeName reg="Strasburg, Shenandoah, Virginia" key="tgn,7014550">Strasburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="940"/>There is nothing remarkable in them, except the massive castle gate, above which, deep sunk in the stone, and as clearly and sharply defined as if executed but yesterday, is the impress of a small, delicate hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/><num value="1">One</num> of the early lords of the castle was <persName n="Gorgas,Comte,Otto,,,von" id="n-0001.0000.00000.00361" reg="expanded:Gorgas,Otto,,,"><roleName n="Comte">Count</roleName> <foreName>Otto</foreName> <nameLink>von</nameLink> <surname>Gorgas</surname></persName>, a young, handsome and gallant knight, whose sole delight was in the exciting pleasures of the chase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="942"/>So devoted, indeed, was he to his favorite pursuit that love could find no entrance to his heart, and the fairest damsels signed in vain for a tender glance or a soft speech from the insensible young <persName><foreName>Nimrod</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="943"/>At length his indifference to the sex had become so notorious that all the man&#x0152;nvring mothers on the banks of the <placeName key="tgn,7012611" n="1.000 1" reg="rhein,europe">Rhine</placeName> had given up in despair the idea of securing him as a match for their daughters; while the disappointed maidens, in revenge for his insensibility to their charms, gave him the name of Steinherzig (stony-hearted), by which he became generally known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="944"/>The <rs>Count</rs>, however, only laughed at the anger of the ladies, and continued to kill with his own hand so much game that the retainers at the castle made it a special condition on entering his service that they should not be compelled to eat venison or wild boar hams more than <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure> in the week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="945"/><num value="1">One</num> <dateStruct value="-12-24"><occasion>Christmas Eve</occasion></dateStruct> that <persName n="Otto,Comte,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00362" reg="mostcommon:Otto,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Comte">Count</roleName> <surname>Otto</surname></persName>, in honor of the festival, had ordered a battue in the forest that then surrounded his castle, the sport was so exciting that at the close of the day he found himself, separated from his followers, in a remote part of the forest, close to a deep clear spring, known to the country people as the <rs>Fairy</rs>'s Well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="946"/>His hands being stained with the blood of slaughtered wild boars, he dismounted from his horse to wash them in the fountain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/>Although the weather was cold, and while frost lay upon the dead leaves that covered the ground, <persName n="Otto,Comte,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00363" reg="mostcommon:Otto,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Comte">Count</roleName> <surname>Otto</surname></persName> found, to his surprise, the water of the well singularly warm and pleasant.--A delicious sensation seemed to run through his veins, and, plunging his arms deeper into the limpid spring, he fancied he felt his right hand clasped by another small soft hand, and the gold ring which he wore gently drawn from his finger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>Although annoyed by his loss, the <rs>Count</rs> thought the ring might have accidentally slipped from his finger; but the well being very deep and the day fast closing in, he remounted his horse and rode back to his castle, resolving in the morning to have the <rs>Fairy</rs>'s Well emptied by his servants, little doubting that he should find his lost ring at the bottom. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/><persName n="Otto,Comte,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00364" reg="mostcommon:Otto,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Comte">Count</roleName> <surname>Otto</surname></persName> did not feel his wonted alacrity to sleep that night; he lay awake and restless, listening feverishly to the hoarse baying of the bandog in the court-yard until near <time value="12am">midnight</time>, when he distinctly heard the draw-bridge of the castle lowered, and a few minutes afterwards a sound of as many little feet pattering up the stone stairs and in an adjoining chamber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="950"/>Then a wild strain of music came floating on the air, shooting a sweet, mysterious thrill to his heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="951"/>Rising softly from his bed, he hastily dressed himself; a little bell sounded, his chamber door was flung suddenly open, and the astonished <rs>Count</rs>, passing into the hall, found himself in the midst of an assemblage of diminutive but distinguished looking strangers of both sexes, who laughed, chatted, danced, and sang, without seeming in the least to notice him. In the centre of the hall stood a superb Christmas-tree, from which a multitude of variegated lights shed a flood of radiance through the apartment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>Never before had a Christmas-tree borne such fruits; for, instead of toys and sweetmeats, the branches were hung with diamond stars and crosses, aigrettes and rubies and sapphires, baldricks embroidered with <placeName reg="Oriental, Burlington, New Jersey" key="tgn,2560759">Oriental</placeName> pearls, and daggers mounted in gold and studded with the rarest gems, at which the <rs>Count</rs> gazed without the power of uttering a word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/>While still lost in wonder at the scene, he could not comprehend, there was a movement at the end of the hail; the company respectfully fell back to make way for a newcomer!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="954"/>when suddenly, in the bright rays of the <name>Christmas</name> light, stood before <persName n="Otto,Comte,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00365" reg="mostcommon:Otto,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Comte">Count</roleName> <surname>Otto</surname></persName> a young female of dazzling beauty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="955"/>Her stature was small, like the other visitors, but she was exquisitely proportioned and magnificently dressed, as for a bail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="956"/>A brilliant diadem sparkled amongst her raven lock; rich point lace only half-veiled her snow-white bosom, and a dress of rose-colored silk sat close to her slender figure, and fell in folds just so low as to reveal the neatest feet and ankles in the world; while her sleeves were short enough to display beautiful arms of dazzling whiteness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="957"/>The charming stranger showed no awkward timidity, for going straight up to the <rs>Count</rs> she caught him by both hands, and in the sweetest of voices said: <cit><q rend="inline">&#x0022;Dear <persName n="Otto,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00366" reg="mostcommon:Otto,nomatch:0"><surname>Otto</surname></persName>, I am come to return your visit.&#x0022;</q><bibl n="voices"></bibl></cit> At the same time she raised her right hand to his lips, which obliged him to kiss it without making any reply; he felt spell-bound, fascinated, and suffered the beautiful stranger to draw him to a couch, where she placed herself at his side, while the guests amused themselves as they pleased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="958"/>Creeping closer and closer to him, till she lay almost in his arms, on a sudden &mdash; heaven knows how &mdash; her lips met his, and before he could think about kissing them he had done so. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="959"/><persName n="Otto,Comte,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00367" reg="mostcommon:Otto,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Comte">Count</roleName> <surname>Otto</surname></persName>, like many other men who have been placed in similar circumstances, was lost from that moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="960"/><q>&#x0022;My dear friend,&#x0022;</q> she lisped gently in his ear, <q>&#x0022;I have brought you a Christmas present &mdash; that which you lost, and hardly hoped to find again, see, I bring it to you.&#x0022;</q> And, drawing from her bosom a little casket set with diamonds, she placed it in the hands of the <rs>Count</rs>, who, on opening it, discovered, to his astonishment, the ring he had lost in the forest well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="961"/>Carried away by a feeling as strange as it was irresistible, the <rs>Count</rs> pressed the casket, and then the lovely stranger, to his bosom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="962"/><q>&#x0022;Delightful!&#x0022;</q> murmured the maiden, who certainly was not oppressed by maiden reserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="963"/>You must excuse me narrating the particulars of the <rs>Count</rs>'s vehement wooing, and how, before they parted that night, the enamored man had offered his hand to his fair guest, which she accepted on condition that he should promise never to pronounce the word <q> &#x0022;death&#x0022;</q> in her presence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="964"/>He gave the required assurance, and the next day the marriage of <persName n="Gorgas,Comte,Otto,,,von" id="n-0001.0000.00000.00368" reg="expanded:Gorgas,Otto,,,"><roleName n="Comte">Count</roleName> <foreName>Otto</foreName> <nameLink>von</nameLink> <surname>Gorgas</surname></persName> and the lovely <rs>Ernestine</rs> &mdash;&mdash; for so was she called &mdash; made him, as the romancists of the period said, <q>&#x0022;the happiest of mortals. &#x0022;</q> As the young <rs>Countess</rs> was handsome, submissive, and prodigiously wealthy, they lived very happily together for some years in their feudal castle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="965"/><num value="1">One</num> day, however, it chanced that they were to assist at grand tourney in the neighborhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="966"/>The Lady Ernestine's paliray stood in waiting for her at the castle gate; but, being too much occupied in adjusting a new and becoming head-gear which her milliner had just brought home, she delayed so long that the <rs>Count</rs>, who had been <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> impatiently striding in his armor up and down the great hail for nearly half an hour, completely lost his temper, and, on his lady making her appearance, looking as brilliant by her natural charms as by her elegant costume, he pettishly exclaimed, <q>&#x0022;Fair dame, you are so long making ready, you would be a good messenger to send in search of Death.&#x0022;</q> Scarcely had he uttered the fatal word than the lady disappeared, leaving no trace but the print of her little hand above the castle gate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="967"/>Every <sic>Christimas</sic> eve, however, she returns and flits about the ruins, with wild lamentations, crying at intervals--<q> &#x0022;Death!
