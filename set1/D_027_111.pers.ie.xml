<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>There were the usual number of <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> rumors in circulation yesterday morning; among them, the stereotyped story that there was &#x0022;fighting at <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.&#x0022; Between <time value="9">nine</time> and <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time> the boom of distant heavy guns, breaking on the ear, seemed to lend confirmation to the report; but authentic advices from the front, received later in the day, dissipated all rumors of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>On the <name>north</name> and <name>south</name> sides all was quiet. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The impression that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> would make an attack before the election is wearing away, as he let yesterday go by without any demonstration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The telegraph informs us he is engaged taking a census of the <rs>McClellan</rs> votes likely to be cast in his army.--Perhaps, if he finds this investigation unsatisfactory, he may pitch the obnoxious voters into battle to-day, or even to- morrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>It would, doubtless, strengthen the <rs>Lincoln</rs> vote, to have it flashed through the country, on election day, that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> had made a &#x0022;combined attack upon <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, and was driving the rebels before him,&#x0022; or something to that effect. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> Our only reason for doubting that something of the sort will not be attempted is that <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName> is absent from the <orgName n="Army of the James" type="army">Army of the James</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>He has gone to <orgName n="New York City" type="newspaper">New York city</orgName> to keep order during the election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>A man with his insatiate thirst for military glory is not apt to leave his command on the eve of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Not that <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName> ever exposes himself to the dangers of war, but when nominally with his army, that is, within <measure n="10miles" type="distance">ten miles</measure> of it, during a fight, he gets whatever credit is gained, and has a <num value="1000">thousand</num> handsome things said of his generalship by the newspaper correspondents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Last <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> week, when his troops were beaten on the <rs>Darbytown</rs>, the <rs>Williamsburg</rs> and <num value="9">Nine</num> Mileroads, he was at <placeName><persName n="Johnson,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Johnson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>'s house</placeName>, on the <placeName key="tgn,2275605" n="1.000 10" reg="Darbytown, Wayne, Pennsylvania">Darbytown</placeName> road, <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> away from any of the fights, yet the newspaper men all agreed that &#x0022;<persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName>'s operations on the north side were an entire success.&#x0022; But we must admit there is an other view which may be taken of <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>'s absence, His &#x0022;success&#x0022; on the <dateStruct value="--27"><day reg="27">27th ultimo</day></dateStruct> may have been discovered by <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> to be of such a questionable kind that he wants no more of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The result of that famous affair was not satisfactory to <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> was quietly withdrawn from the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>There is a possibility that <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName> has met with similar treatment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Certainly he failed worse in his undertaking than <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> in his. The latter blew up some of our men and took some prisoners.
