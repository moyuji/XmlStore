<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/> <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName> is neither distinguished by administrative capacity nor by diplomatic courtesy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>The publication in this country of his dispatch to <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Cowley</foreName></persName>, before it could have been read to the <rs>French Minister</rs> for Foreign Affairs, was an outrageous breach of international courtesy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>Some of his lordship's enemies attribute this extraordinary proceeding to an abject desire to conciliate <persName n="Adams,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00043" reg="mostcommon:Adams,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName> and his Government; a much more reasonable assumption is, that it was due to his eagerness to allay the anxiety of the <rs>Stock Exchange</rs> and the <placeName reg="Cotton, Roane, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117894">Cotton</placeName> market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>But it would have been very easy to attain this object by an informal publication of the purport of the dispatch; and the only conclusion we can come to is that <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName> is either ignorant or oblivious of diplomatic at quette.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>But if the publication of the dispatch was an impertinence and a blunder what are we to say of its substance?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>However, it is plain that we are not to <unclear></unclear> in the dispatch for vindication of the <name>Ministerial</name> policy, or an explanation of the views of the <name>Americanizing</name> section of the <rs>Cabinet</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/> His <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> argument is directed to dispose of the precedents alleged in favor of recognition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>Those of <placeName reg="Ellas" key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> and <placeName reg="Belgie" key="tgn,1000063">Belgium</placeName>, he affirms, are not precedents in point at all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>Passing to the stronger and closer parallel afforded by the case of the <rs>Spanish</rs> colonies, he points out that we did not recognize all of these, but only those in which <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> had practically ceased to keep up the war, omitting all mention of <placeName reg="Peru, Miami, Indiana" key="tgn,2033277">Peru</placeName>, in which a Spanish army still asserted the right of the mother country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>But the presence of that army in <placeName reg="Peru, Miami, Indiana" key="tgn,2033277">Peru</placeName> created just the same danger to the other colonies that the presence of a Federal army of <num value="200000">200,000</num> men in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> creates for <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, and the <name>Carolinas</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>If <placeName reg="Peru, Miami, Indiana" key="tgn,2033277">Peru</placeName> had been conquered, that army would have passed on to attack the other revolted possessions of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, and in fact, the plan of attacking them in detail was the only <num value="1">one</num> which afforded any solid chance of success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>The real equivalent, in the case of <placeName reg="North America" key="tgn,1000001">North America</placeName>, for the action we took in the matter of the <rs>Spanish</rs> colonies, would be the recognition of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>, waiving, as of course we should waive, the question of the frontier line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>But, says Historicus, that war had lasted as many years as the present war has lasted months.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>Well, what of that?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>If the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> have achieved in <measure n="20months" type="date">twenty months</measure> what it took the <rs>Spanish</rs> colonies <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> to accomplish, is that any reason why they should be denied the privileges to which their achievements entitle them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>It must be remembered that within the last <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> modern science has rendered war far more costly, far more destructive, far more effectual, and therefore far shorter than it was <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a century before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>The <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> mutiny began, wrested nearly the whole of Bengal and the <rs>Northwest</rs> from our hands, and was utterly trampled out within a twelvemonth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/><measure n="2years" type="date">Two years</measure> of such a war as that which the <rs>Federal Government</rs> is waging against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> are of far more account than <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> of such a war as <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> waged against her revolted colonies; and to have sustained the <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> burdens, the losses, the perils of such a war, is to have established a better title to independence than ever was established by any nation that ever yet drew the sword for national existence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/> Historicus next brings forward a precedent of his own adverse to recognition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>He says that when the <rs>Government</rs> of <persName><foreName>Louis</foreName> <genName n="16">XVI</genName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>made a treaty of commerce with the <rs>Government</rs> of our revolted colonies, <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> <unclear></unclear> that act, involving as it did the recognition of the revolt, <unclear></unclear> an act of hostility, and made it the ground for a declaration of war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>Of course such treaties are never really secret.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>But a later case most foolishly <unclear></unclear> by the <name>Ministerial</name> advocate, disposes of all argument on this point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>As to the pretended difficulty of knowing what to recognize no <num value="1">one</num> is better aware than this ingenious plunder that it is merely a pretence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>We do not recognize Territories, but Governments, we should recognize not <q>&#x0022;the <rs>South</rs>&#x0022;</q> but the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States of America</placeName>; and we should recognize them not by defining their frontiers, but by accrediting an Ambassador to their <rs type="role2">President</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>Because we interfered unfairly and violently; because our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> act was an act of hostility to the <name>Sultan</name>; because we did not interfere till he was on the point of crushing out the insurrection; and because <num value="1">one</num> of the intervening Powers was actually at war with the <name>Porto</name> on her own account, and for sinister purposed of her own.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>But so far as precedents go, those just discussed establish the right of intervention beyond dispute, while they prove nothing either against the possibility of effecting by mediation a pacific settlement, nor against the wisdom of interference in such a case as the present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>The Confederates are not <unclear>Gr </unclear> or Belgians; they are neither savages nor coward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>They have shown their ability and resolution to maintain their own independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>It is, then, conceivable that the <rs>North</rs>, it called upon to submit the quarrel to <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> arbitration would provoke <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> to throw their swords into the scale?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>Why not?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>Because the question of slavery would come in. On the contrary, the question of slavery cannot possibly come to, unless the mediating Powers were insane enough to try to reconstruct the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>If it be a Divine gift and blessing, it is <num value="1">one</num> with which we have nothing to do. The domestic institutions of the <num value="2">two</num> nations between which mediation is proposed are nothing to the mediators.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>Their difference affords a reason for separation, and that is all. Mediation is required only to put a stop to hostilities, to secure the freedom of natural highways, and to draw a frontier line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>About the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="2">two</num> points no difference of opinion could well arise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>The presence of a few Federal garrisons on Southern soil does not affect the question, as may be clearly seen by the precedents of <placeName reg="Ellas" key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> and <placeName reg="Belgie" key="tgn,1000063">Belgium</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>There are <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> distinct principles on which a frontier line might be drawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>Or we might undertake ourselves to draw a frontier line, giving to the <rs>North</rs> these districts which are Northern by sympathy, and to the <rs>South</rs> those which desire to be Southern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>There could be few cases in which it would be easier to decide on a common basis of action; few in which the power of the mediators to enforce their decimation could be less doubtful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>The South is ready to accept any fair terms of peace; if the <rs>North</rs> should reject them, she would become powerless for aggression as soon as the mediating Powers deprived her of the command of the sea. <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> then, can, if they will, induce the belligerents to make peace; they have a clear right to do so; and those who prevent them from doing so take on themselves the whole responsibility of the protraction of the war &mdash; are answerable for every life that is lost by the sword in <placeName reg="America, Wabash, Indiana" key="tgn,2131960">America</placeName> by famine or fever in <placeName key="tgn,7008154" n="1.000 10" reg="lancashire,england,united kingdom,europe">Lancashire</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/> I had many newspapers given me by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> officers several of whom offered to exchange cards, with which I was fortunately provided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>I have rarely met a more pleasant fellow than the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <rs type="role2">Major</rs> with whom I negotiated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>I had a good deal of conversation with him and the <unclear></unclear> correspondent of the <rs>Associated Press</rs>, who was of the party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>Our loss in the same quarter was not small.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/> Altogether I never enjoyed anything more than I did the whole day. * * I was convinced that these men would never trouble us much more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>It had rained furiously during the night and availing themselves of the additional concealment thus afforded, they had decamped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>As soon as their departure was well ascertained, <rs type="role">Gen.</rs> R. directed me to push forward his whole line of skirmishers, and discover the whereabouts of the enemy; so on I went with my line, nearly a mile from flank to flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>We have every confidence in the <name>Legislature</name> about to assemble that it will take care to select <num value="1">one</num> not less competent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>The times imperatively require us to choose our strongest man, without regard to personal or old party distinctions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>All must desire to see <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> represented in a <sic>manenr</sic> worthy of her past renown and present high position in this great struggle for independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>What is wanted is a wise and thoughtful statesman, calm amid the storm of revolution, patriotic, conciliatory, and just, possessed of solid information and a ripe judgment, and gifted with the eloquence to clothe his arguments in an attractive form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>Many excellent and able names have been presented for this office; but it is no disparagement to any of them to express our conviction that no <num value="1">one</num> of them seems to possess these qualifications in so eminent a degree as <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Russell,the Honorable,Charles,W.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00061" reg="default:Russell,Charles,W.,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">the Hon.</roleName> <foreName>Charles</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName>,</hi> of <placeName key="tgn,7014620" n="1.000 73" reg="wheeling, ohio, west virginia">Wheeling</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/> The considerations already adduced would lead us to prefer this gentleman; but other arguments are not wanting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>His private character is irreproachable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>Although living in a section of the <rs>State</rs> where so many have bowed the knee to the infamous yoke of Abolition, he has ever been, in word and deed a true <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginian</rs>--<q>&#x0022;faithful found among the faithless.&#x0022; </q> A large practice and a considerable property &mdash; the fruit of half a life of constant labor and honorable exertion &mdash; were sacrificed by him at the beginning of the war, a voluntary and cheerful offering upon the altar of liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>With his family he left the home of his attachment, and nobly preferred exile to submission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>We doubt whether any man in the <rs>State</rs> has made more sacrifices for the cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>It would seem that some recognition is due to the noble band of patriots from the <rs>Northwest</rs>, who, under every adverse temptation, have been faithful to the flag of the old Commonwealth; and surely in no possible way could <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> better attest, than by the election of <persName n="Russell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00062" reg="nearbymention:Russell,Charles,W.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName>, her fixed and stern determination to insist, at every cost, upon the whole of her ancient boundaries, without mutilation or abridgment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/> It was, we presume, a sense of these considerations which led so many of the members of the <name>Legislature</name> to cast their votes for <persName n="Russell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00063" reg="nearbymention:Russell,Charles,W.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName> at the last election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>Without any special effort in his favor, he then came very near being elected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>Since that time <persName n="Russell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00064" reg="nearbymention:Russell,Charles,W.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName>'s course in Congress has added largely to his reputation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>In the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> he is justly regarded as <num value="1">one</num> of the ablest men of the body, and the reputation thus acquired would at once give weight to his counsels in the <name>Senate</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>Judging by the vote of the last session, it is not unreasonable to conjecture that the choice of the <name>Legislature</name> will fall upon <persName n="Russell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00065" reg="nearbymention:Russell,Charles,W.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName>; and as no possible objection can be urged to him, we believe his election would give general satisfaction to the public. </p>

<head><num value="2">Two</num> remarkable contrasts.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/> A Washington correspondent of a Chicago paper gives a graphic account of the manner in which his august <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs>, <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00072" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, goes forth from the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>His carriage, while awaiting him at the gate of the palace, is surrounded by fierce looking guards, and when he enters it and proceeds to take his air, a body of cavalry, armed to the teeth, ride before, and behind, and both sides the <name>Presidential</name> carriage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>It is in the style of Eastern despots that the <rs>President</rs> of what was once a Republic shows himself in public, exhibits himself in public, and is afraid to appear in any other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>None of the outward signs of the change which has come over the old Government of the <name>United State</name> are more significant than this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>No circumstance more clearly shows the want of confidence of the <rs>President</rs> in the people, and the personal pusillanimity of the man, who, from the moment he stole into <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> in disguise in a freight ear, leaving his wife and children to the threatened perils of the railroad train from which he had made his escape, he has shown himself as careful of his own safety as reckless of the lives of others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>It is in perfect keeping, however, with a Government which has trampled down all vestiges of a free Constitution that its forms should correspond with its spirits, and its chief never appear in public except surrounded by guards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>But what a contrast to the <rs>Southern President</rs> to him whom the impudent varlets of the <rs>Northern</rs> press presume to call a military despot!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>The <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> simplicity and unaffected dignity of the early <rs>Presidents</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> can now be found alone in that country to which the genius of Liberty has fled from the <rs>North</rs>, and which still preserves unimpaired the principles of constitutional freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/><persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00073" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Jefferson,,,:3"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> dwells in a modest mansion, undefended by a single soldier, and goes forth upon his daily duties with as little state as any private citizen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>Not a solitary guard attends him, and no stranger who meets him would imagine that the plain and unpretending gentleman was the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> is too strong in the affections of the people to require an armed guard, and too much of a <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> and a gentleman to ape the vulgar state of <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00074" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.--We are willing to put the <num value="2">two</num> <rs type="role2">Presidents</rs> side by side, and let the world judge the people by their representative men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/> Another of the remarkable and suggestive contrasts of the times is that furnished by the recent battles before <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, under the leadership of a General whose forte is clicking and digging, sat down before <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> in tremendous force, and for <num value="2">two</num> whole months were engaged in constructing a chain of fortifications, the most powerful and complete known in modern warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/><persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00075" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, with the resources of a nation and a world at his back, and the most unlimited supply of men and means, taxed his engineering skill to the utmost to construct works about <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> which should be perfectly impregnable, and should make a sure thing of the <q>&#x0022;doomed city.&#x0022;</q> Everything was at stake; the fate of his country, and his own reputation, which was to him even more valuable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>He believed in fortifications, and had deliberately selected that mode of capturing <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> in preference to a fair fight in the open field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>Of course he encircled this city with a series of <placeName reg="Gibraltar, Union, North Carolina" key="tgn,2348613">Gibraltar</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>And yet, with <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> preparations, with heavy guns in addition to his <orgName n="Field Artillery" type="artillery">field artillery</orgName>, with odds of <num value="2">two</num> to <num value="1">one</num> against us, his fortifications were swept away by the assault of Southern soldiers like chaff before the whirlwind and the braggart pretender and his legions driven like yelping hounds for <measure n="30miles" type="distance">thirty miles</measure> to the shelter of their gun boats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>What a contrast did the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> present to the scenes about <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>The cases were now reversed, the <rs>Southern</rs> troops had the advantage of position, but had only a brief interval for preparation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>They had not time to construct powerful fortifications, a few rifle pits and an old stone wall, which had been built years before for anything but military purposes, were their <sic>principel </sic> works of defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>Yet, attacked by the largest and best equipped army of modern times, outnumbering them <num value="2">two</num> to <num value="1">one</num>, they drove back the multitudinous host with the most frightful carnage and thorough discomfiture that has ever been witnessed on the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>What a contrast!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>What a grand and significant illustration of the superior and sublime valor and virtue of Southern soldiers! </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head>Union sentiment in the <rs>South</rs></head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/> The General commanding the <orgName n="District of Norfolk and Portsmouth" type="district">Norfolk district</orgName>, in his proclamation for the election of members of Congress, insists that there always has been and still is a prevailing Union sentiment in that district.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>The same may be said with equal truth of the entire <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> seem determined never to give up the delusion that the <rs>South</rs> is devoted to the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>Their unheard of atrocities during the present war are supposed to have confirmed our attachment to the delectable Government which has made us the victims of its unparalleled barbarism. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/> It is useless to attempt to dispel this delusion &mdash; It can never be done except at the point of the sword.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>That there are still some Union men in the <rs>South</rs> is as true as that there were a good many tories in the <name>Revolution</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>They are men who want to save their property at the expense of their man hood, and who would how the knee to the dominions of Souloque if he would consent not to subject them to heavy taxes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>But their numbers are as inconsiderable as their character is beneath contempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>The great mass of the <rs>Southern</rs> people would this moment prefer the rule of the <rs>Queen</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 6" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, <rs type="role" reg="Emperor">the Emperor</rs> of the <rs>French</rs>, of <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName>, or of <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>, to the restoration of the <rs>Union</rs>.--Even if we could be subjugated it would not be a willing Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>Our hearts could not be conquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>We would be men without a country, praying for and plotting forever the downfall of the <rs>Union</rs> despotism, and transmitting to our latest posterity the most inextinguishable hate of its very name. </p> </div3>
