<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/> &#x0022;There is something wrong about the cavalry officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>The material is as good as can be desired, but the discipline is wretched, and it is almost in efficient in consequence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>The move was made, the horses were actually captured, the men in charge shot down, But, instead of turning back the horses under a sufficient guard, our cavalry became a mob of plunderers, commenced rilling the hoisters of pistols, doubted themselves with sports, and in the midst of their confusion, a brigade of Federal cavalry desired in, recovered the horses, and scattered our men.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/> The movement referred to was not <hi rend="italics">ordered</hi> by the <rs>General</rs> commanding, or any other officer, but Col, <persName n="Harrison,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Harrison,nomatch:0"><surname>Harrison</surname></persName> in following out general instructions, and supposing he would have infancy support judged it proper to be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>It would have been a complete success, if the support relied on had been present. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>To do this he moved his command in advance and to the right of our line of infantry skirmishers.--When within <placeName><distance reg="2miles">two miles</distance> of <persName n="Dandridge,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="mostcommon:Dandridge,nomatch:0"><surname>Dandridge</surname></persName></placeName> he came upon a force of the enemy's mounted infantry, then dismounted and deployed for battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>The horses spoken of belonged to the dismounted line of the enemy, and were a few paces in its rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>Some <num value="300">three hundred</num> paces further to the rear was a strong force of the enemy's cavalry already in line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>To secure the horses it was evidently necessary to dispose of this supporting force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>These <num value="2">two</num> regiments were already hotly engaged with the force in front, greatly outnumbering their own, but their achievements heretofore are the best guarantee that this disparity would not have been fatal to the success of the movement had the rear attack been prevented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>Our infantry skirmishers, in conformity with whose movements Col. H. had acted on this occasion, were perhaps and hour in advance of the main line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>This was occasioned by the extreme ruggedness of the country over which they marched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>Without imputing any blame to the infantry officers, <rs type="role">Col.</rs> H. was disappointed by not having their support &mdash; support which, had they been upon the ground, would have effectually prevented the rear attack upon the <num value="8" type="ordinal">8th</num> and <orgName type="regiment" key="TX11">11th Texas</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>These <num value="2">two</num> regiments, attacked in front, flank, and rear, were necessarily withdrawn, rough the ground lost was soon regained, but not until the enemy had removed the horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>There is no excuse whatever for the statement that the horses were lost because &#x0022;our cavalry became a mob of plunderers.&#x0022; They had no time to plunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>They were the whole time vigorously opposed by superior forces; and although these gallant regiments did no better fighting here than on many other occasions which have made their names famous in the <orgName n="Army of Tennessee" type="army">Army of Tennessee</orgName>, yet the command was complimented for this particular movement in unequivocal terms by <persName n="Jenkins,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00031" reg="mostcommon:Jenkins,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jenkins</surname></persName>, who had charge of the attacking force, and by <persName n="Longstreet,Lieutenant-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00032" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant-General">Lieut.-Gen.</roleName> <surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>, commanding the army. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>The immediate provocation of these dire menaces is that they do not always have sugar in their coffee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>Some few of their number, officers we suppose of the old regular service, are not as furious as their companions, who, being civilians turned soldiers, are of course the most uncivil of the human race.
