<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> Notwithstanding we have now been engaged in this great contest for nearly <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>, and have had experience unrivalled in history, there is no subject so little or so imperfectly understood as that of war!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The struggle was commenced with the mistaken and unfortunate idea that generals were born and not made &mdash; military knowledge unnecessary; that <rs n="bowie knives" type="product">Bowie-knives</rs>, pikes, revolvers and brave men would alone gain battles and give us liberty and independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The absurdity of such ideas has been proved by a terrible and sad experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>An army not in good discipline, well drilled, and commanded by competent officers, is still but the shadow of an army, incapable of executing great enterprises or of gaining permanent results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Of this the history of war contains abundant proof; and yet, in our own army, we see the elementary branches of the profession grossly neglected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Even the school of the soldier, company and battalion, evolutions of the line, as well as the duties of guards and sentinels, are but imperfectly understood, and are considered by far too many as useless knowledge, because they do not understand them, and do not care to take the trouble of learning. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> That the people should be taught that war is a simple matter, requiring no special information or study, was, under the circumstances, to be expected, as it accords with human experience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The country was full of gentlemen of education and those distinguished in civil life, but without military information.--A few ideas gained from reading the campaigns of <persName n="Wellington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:Wellington,nomatch:0"><surname>Wellington</surname></persName>, <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> or <placeName key="tgn,2050078" n="1.000 4" reg="marlborough, middlesex county, massachusetts">Marlborough</placeName>, was, perhaps, its greatest extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>When the time came for the people to arise these gentlemen must be officers, and, acting upon the popular but <unclear></unclear> dogma &#x0022;that generals are born and not made&#x0022;-- <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">Nemo vir magnus sine afflutu aliquo divino unquam fuit </hi></foreign>--and the army was soon filled with general and other officers incapable of performing the solemn and important duties that devolved upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Thus the good of the nation was scarified to ambition, personal selfishness and nepotism; and disaster upon disaster has been the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Many generals now in the field holding responsible commands are ignorant of the evolutions of the line, and, to a great majority, grand tactics, strategy, and the other branches of the art, is a perfect mystery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>It is in consequence of this want of professional information that so many battles have been fought without any great results. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> By the impossibility of man&#x0153;uvring our army, our battles are fought in parallel lines &mdash; decidedly the worst order of battle, since there is no skill in causing armies to fight, where the chances are equal, regiment against regiment, in the absence of all tactics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>A battle thus gained is merely the shifting of positions without any substantial advantages, as experience in this war has shown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The best combinations of a general-in-chief will fall with incompetent generals and a badly-instructed army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The great advantages of grand tactical combinations and man&#x0153;uvres are lost to us on the day of battle because our generals dare not attempt them &mdash; distrusting their own abilities &mdash; as they would most probably result in disaster and our probable ruin. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> The fundamental principles of war consist mainly in carrying, by strategic combinations, the mass of an army upon the decisive point of the theatre of operations, and as much as possible upon the communications of the enemy, without endangering your own; then man&#x0153;uvring so as to engage with the weight of your forces fractions only of the hostile army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Then strategy prepares the chances of victory and influences in advance its results. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> The directing principle of the combinations of grand tactics is the same as that of strategy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>It is in well combining and carrying the mass of your forces upon a part only of that of the enemy, and upon that point it is most important to overwhelm, and promises the greatest advantages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>When the numerical strength and discipline of opposing armies are nearly equal, the result of battles depends mainly upon the order of battle adopted, the abilities of the generals, the cause of the struggle, and the moral condition of the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>These render victories more or less decisive and determine their results and importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The formation and cultivation of the <hi rend="italics">morale</hi> of an army is the peculiar province of a general-in-chief; and none but a great general and a just man can fully succeed in inspiring the troops with <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> this important and indispensable sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>It is <num value="1">one</num> of the surest pledges of victory. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> Such are the cardinal principles of the elevated branches of the art of war, which appear simple in themselves, but which no <num value="1">one</num> can sufficiently comprehend, to be a general, without <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> mastering its elementary branches any more than <num value="1">one</num> can learn mathematics by commencing with the differential and integral calculus, or to read before learning the alphabet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The nation that ignores professional information, and undertakes to back its generals in war, must, if this suicidal policy is continued, be languished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/><measure n="4years" type="date">Four years</measure> of experience in military matters has well taught us that no man can be fit to be a general who has not received a military education, or has not well studied the different branches of the science as a profession. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> Another consideration enters into the scale in calculating victories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/><orgName n="Our Country" type="newspaper">Our country</orgName> has been divided as to whether the war should be conducted offensively or defensively.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>For <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> the latter policy was adopted, and with success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>So marked were its advantages to our cause that its opposers lessened and was confined to a few, with, perhaps, more ambition and bravery that prudence.--Those who are in favor of carrying the war into the enemy's territory should remember that <persName n="Hannibal,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Hannibal,nomatch:0"><surname>Hannibal</surname></persName> of <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName> lost <placeName reg="Carthage, Jasper, Missouri" key="tgn,2058276">Carthage</placeName>. </p> <closer> <signed>Bohemian.</signed> </closer> </div4> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> At the request of many ship mates, I would ask, through the columns of your paper, if, by the laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, the men in the naval service are entitled to furloughs allowed men in the army?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>I see no reason why it should be otherwise, as we are all <hi rend="italics">volunteers,</hi> enlisted in the same holy cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>There is, however, a vast difference as regards privileges shown men in the army and navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>In the army they are continually getting <measure n="30days" type="date">thirty days</measure> furlough, while those in naval service cannot, even in the most <hi rend="italics">urgent</hi> cases, obtain a leave of absence for <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure>. This distinction has caused much dissatisfaction and some desertion in the fleet; and as the evil could be so easily remedied, I would ask an investigation of the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The men in the naval service are not, as is supposed by many, <hi rend="italics">conscripts;</hi> but the large majority of us are old and tried soldiers &mdash; veterans of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Lee,R.,E.,,:1"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s invincible army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> In <dateStruct value="-04-"><month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct> last, an order was issued throughout the entire <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName>, calling for volunteers for the naval service; and many of us, believing that we would promote the interest of the cause, promptly responded to the call &mdash; thus becoming members of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> Navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>But if, in the exchange we have made, we are to forfeit the privilege shown our former comrades in the army &mdash; I say, if we are to be denied the <hi rend="italics">dear </hi> privilege of <hi rend="italics">occasionally</hi> visiting the loved ones from whom we have been so long separated &mdash; we earnestly entreat the authorities at <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 7" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> to allow us to return to our several commands in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> &#x0022;It appears that the enemy, after being driven out of <placeName reg="Columbia, Richland, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013641">Columbia</placeName>, evacuated <placeName reg="Murfreesboro, Rutherford, Tennessee" key="tgn,7014175">Murfreesboro</placeName>'; and, uniting all their forces, took up position on the high cliffs south of <placeName reg="Franklin, Williamson, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017751">Franklin</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>They then fell back to their fortifications on the edge of the town, where they formed a strong line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Immediate dispositions were made to assault their works, which was done in front, chiefly by <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Cheatham,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Cheatham,nomatch:0"><surname>Cheatham</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName>, with spirit and vigor, the various commanders leading their columns, the bands playing and the men huzzahing. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The enemy opened a very severe and destructive fire upon our assaulting line, and it was in this charge the heavy loss of general officers occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The irresistible bravery of our men carried everything before them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>The lines were occupied by our troops, several of our generals &mdash; among them the heroic <rs>Cleburne</rs> &mdash;&mdash; being shot on the breastworks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>This attack was made at <time value="5pm">5 o'clock P. M.</time> Despite the terrible losses, the army entered the enemy's lines in the highest spirits, with bands playing and flags waving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>It was then discovered that the enemy had a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line, where they had rallied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>There they were quickly assailed by our men, and a severe and close fight ensued, wherein the comba <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> tants were separated by a ditch and breastworks. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> &#x0022;It soon became a hand-to-hand fight, which was continued into the night until the enemy gave way and retired to the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Our army then occupied this line; and early the next day pushed on towards <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>; and on the <date value="12-01">1st of December, </date> when our informant left, the rear corps was at Breatwood, <placeName><distance reg="8miles">eight miles</distance> from <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName></placeName>. </p>
