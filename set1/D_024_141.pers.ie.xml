<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> We copy into our columns this morning, from the <hi rend="italics">Sentinel,</hi> of yesterday, an important communication from the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs> to <persName n="Mason,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="nearbymention:Mason,John,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Mason</surname></persName>, our <rs type="role2">Commissioner</rs> to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>This paper relates to the matter of the revocation of the <name>Exequatur</name> of <persName n="Moore,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Moore,George,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Moore</surname></persName>, British Consul at this city, and explains the policy of the <rs>President</rs> in his course with reference to the question of consular agencies generally in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> has regarded the <name>Exequatur</name> given to the <name>Consuls</name> of foreign States by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> prior to the establishment of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> as valid, upon the ground that the <rs>Federal Government</rs> was then the constitutional agent of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, and that &#x0022;an act done by an agent while duly authorized continues to bind the principle after the revocation of the agent's authority.&#x0022; This will be readily concurred in even by those who disliked to see received here agents of Governments which persisted under circumstances somewhat aggravating in their refusal to recognize our own representatives to their Courts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> Acting under this view, foreign Consuls have received at the hands of the <rs>Government</rs> of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> all due consideration and official courtesy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>It seems from the letter of <persName n="Benjamin,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Benjamin,J.,P.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Benjamin</surname></persName>, however, that under the tolerance of our Government there had grown up an abuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/><persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Lyons</foreName></persName>, it appears, has been from his post in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> exercising authority over Consuls in the <rs>South</rs>, and even appointing agents to supervise <name>British</name> interests in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>This our Government has thought it its duty to prohibit, and therefore requires that hereafter all communications and instructions to British Consuls shall be restricted to vessels arriving from or dispatched to foreign ports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The <rs>Secretary</rs> makes a pointed hit by intimating that this restriction is imposed with the less reluctance by the <rs>President</rs> because of the ample facilities of communication afforded by the vessels continually plying between the <rs>Confederate</rs> and neutral ports, in spite of the paper blockade &#x0022;upheld by <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> Government, in disregard&#x0022; &#x0022;of the rights of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>&#x0022;and &#x0022;the dictates of public law!&#x0022; </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> We suppose we are to understand from this communication that no new Consuls will be received here bearing the <name>Exequatur</name> of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Are we to infer that no Minister residing at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and accredited to the <rs>Government</rs> there is to be permitted to exercise authority over Consuls here, and that they must receive their instructions from home direct or through a neutral port?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The letter relates especially to the <rs>English Minister</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/> The town was busily engaged yesterday in talking over another <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> raid which is reported as now being made upon <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> from the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>At <num value="1">one</num> time rumor got so outrageous that she had from <num value="6000">six</num> to <num value="60000">sixty thousand</num> Federals advancing upon the city.--They had whipped <persName n="Wise,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Wise,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName>, gotten between him and the capital, and were in <placeName reg="Charles City, Charles City, Virginia" key="tgn,2111055">Charles City</placeName> rapidly marching upon the &#x0022;doomed city.&#x0022; The truth of the story, as far as we have been able to gather it by application at the proper quarters, is this: A <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> gunboat, accompanied by <num value="2">two</num> transports, came up Thursday as far as the mouth of the <placeName reg="Chickahominy, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1122759">Chickahominy river</placeName> and went up that stream a short distance on a pillaging expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>They returned to <placeName reg="Jamestown, Prince Edward, Virginia" key="tgn,2419102">Jamestown</placeName> yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>As to the troops, except those marauders landed from the boats, nothing seems to be definitely known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>There is doubtless a force some distance up the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>; but how far, it is impossible to ascertain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Last night, at <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time>, no <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had been heard from at <placeName key="tgn,2095113" n="1.000 10" reg="Slatersville, Providence, Rhode Island">Slatersville</placeName>, <placeName><distance reg="9miles">nine miles</distance> below the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName></placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> It may be proper to state that every precaution has been taken by the military authorities, and that there are troops enough around the city to drive back a much larger force than may be expected to be concerned in a mere raid. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> <num value="1">One</num> report says that the enemy landed in considerable force at a point known as <rs n="windsor shade" type="product">Windsor Shades</rs>, in <placeName reg="James City, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1002511">James City county</placeName>, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct>; but this, as other rumors connected with this affair, lacks confirmation. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The particulars which reach us of the affair of <dateStruct><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> last, in <placeName reg="Culpeper, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002155">Culpeper county</placeName>, tend to confirm the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> reports received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>As has already been stated, the passage of the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> was effected by the enemy at fords not picketed by our troops, and consequently without interference or interruption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Before our pickets could communicate with the camps, to enable our troops to prepare for an attack, the force of the enemy, largely superior in number, was precipitated upon them, and it was only by severe and hard fighting that victory was wrested from the bold and determined foe. Our gunners at the <orgName type="regiment" key="1Battery">first battery</orgName> charged by the enemy had no time allowed them to use their pieces, but, manfully standing by their guns, they fought the enemy with their rammers, and in this way succeeded in unhorsing several of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> cavalry.--They were finally overpowered and forced to leave their pieces, or were cut down or captured in their defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>This was early in the morning, and before any preparation was had to resist the unexpected attack. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> Throughout the day the contest between the cavalry of the contending forces raged with varying success, our troops gaining the advantage at every point where the odds against them were not overwhelming. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The heaviest of the fighting upon our side was done by the brigades of <persName n="Lee,General,W.,H.,F.," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="default:Lee,W.,H.,F.,"><roleName n="General">Gens.</roleName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> and <persName n="Hampton,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Hampton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Hampton</surname></persName>, though the troops composing <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Jones,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="nearbymention:Jones,Robert,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> were engaged, and are said to have fought gallantly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/> Our loss in the engagement, it is believed by those who have favorable opportunities for knowing, will not fall far short of <num value="600">600</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>This includes the entire loss, killed, wounded, and missing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The loss of the enemy, it is said, exceeds our own. There is little difference on either side in the number of horses taken.--The battery from which our men were driven in the morning was not moved by the enemy from its position, and when the fighting terminated in the evening was again taken possession of. The statement that the enemy <measure n="3" type="captured">captured three</measure> of our pieces, is incorrect to the extent that it implied they retained them as part of the fruits of the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>No piece of our artillery was removed from the field by them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>On the other hand, they left <num value="4">four</num> guns brought over the river by them. </p>
