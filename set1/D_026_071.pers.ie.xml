<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/> * * * * * In reply to your telegram for my principles of exemption I respectfully state that I mean to certify as exempt all persons <hi rend="italics">necessary</hi> to the preservation and operation of the <rs>State Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>This, of course, includes all her institutions, such as cities, towns, colleges, banks, asylums, &#x0026;c., holding that bodies politic have an inherent right of self-preservation, and that the <rs>State</rs> authorities have a right to designate, <hi rend="italics">without question,</hi> all persons they may think needful and requisite for the purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>While however, I lay down this bread proposition, I acknowledge my anxiety as well as my duty to be to send all persons into the army not <hi rend="italics">indispensable</hi> to State purposes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/> Exemption from military service should attach to no person who is <hi rend="italics">set</hi> in the performance of civil duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>An officer, even though named in the <rs>Constitution</rs> and in the laws, without any duty to perform in consequence of the presence of the enemy in his county, should be required to join in the public defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>In this there is no inconsistent nor incompatible duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>It cannot be said that in any sense he is needful to the <rs>State Government</rs> when he cannot perform the duties for which he was elected or appointed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>For instance, take the case of Sheriffs, <rs type="role" reg="Clerk">Clerks</rs> of Courts, or <rs type="role" reg="Justice">Justices</rs> of the <name>Peace</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Their duties are local, and are to be performed in their several counties, and it would be incompatible <unclear>with</unclear> the discharge of these duties for these officers to be placed in the army &mdash; as in such event the civil duties required of them would have to be abandoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>In such cases, the duties being so incompatible with military service, such officers are entitled to exemption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>But where such officers are prevented from the discharge of the duties of their respective offices by reason of the occupancy of their county by the public enemy, the reason for their exemption ceases, can there be any reason why they should not go into the army as soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>There is no incompatibility of duty &mdash; no stoppage of the <rs>State Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>It may be said that their counties may be recovered from the enemy; this is true, and when the event occurs, such officers will have an undoubted fight to be restored to their offices and discharged from the army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/> In reference to the <name>Banks</name> I have concluded to exempt the <rs>Presidents</rs>, Cashiers and Tellers of all such, in which the <rs>State</rs> is a stockholder, as necessary to the protection of her interests therein, but I do not exempt their clerks, as they are mere ministerial officers whose places may be supplied from those outside of the conscript age. To this there is, however, an exception in the case of the <rs>State Banks</rs> in this city, who are the fiscal agents of the <rs>State</rs>, without charge, and who are by law the receivers, custodians and disbursers of the revenue and other public funds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>These <persName n="Banks,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00063" reg="mostcommon:Banks,nomatch:0"><surname>Banks</surname></persName> are allowed <unclear>toget</unclear> their whole corps of officers and clerks as necessary as well to the interests of the <rs>State</rs> as to the execution of the laws touching the public <unclear></unclear>. But I have wholly refused exemptions to the employees of the independent <persName n="Banks,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00064" reg="mostcommon:Banks,nomatch:0"><surname>Banks</surname></persName> [those in which the <rs>State</rs> is not a stockholder] --officers as well as clerks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>These <persName n="Banks,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00065" reg="mostcommon:Banks,nomatch:0"><surname>Banks</surname></persName> are founded upon associated surplus capital, and are operated entirely for the advantage of private interests of the stockholders, and they have no more right to exemption from the military service due to the country for their overseers and managers than other individual owners of real and personal estate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Indeed, capital thus associated, is less entitled to favor than when invested in land and negroes, embracing generally the whole of <num value="1">one</num>'s private fortune, and operated almost exclusively in raising bread and meat, yet I cannot pretend to give these exemptions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/> The <num value="2">two</num> great principles which guides my action are--<num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, to exempt all persons who are really necessary to the preservation of the <rs>State Government</rs> in all her parts and institutions; but, secondly, to exempt nobody who is not practically necessary thereto.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Officers who are refugees from their counties, having no civil duties to perform, are left to the requisitions of military authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/><rs type="role" reg="Commissioner">Commissioners</rs> of the revenue having nothing to do &mdash; the <name>Legislature</name> having forborne to lay any pages for the present year &mdash; are for the time being subject to military duty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/> I am now considering the propriety of withholding my certificate from all <rs type="role" reg="Justice">Justices</rs> of the <name>Peace</name> under <measure n="45years" type="date">forty five years</measure> of age. Our Constitution provides that there shall be <num value="4">four</num> Justices to each <orgName n="Magisterial District" type="district">magisterial district</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>That number is certainly not necessary to the administration of justice and the enforcement of the laws within their district and county, and I have almost concluded, as I have said, to withhold my certificate, as stated and leave it to the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> to exempt or not. </p>
