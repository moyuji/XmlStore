<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> --I have the honor to submit the following outline of the recent operations of this army for the information of the <name>Department</name>: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> The position occupied by the enemy opposite <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> being <num value="1">one</num> in which he could not be attacked to advantage, it was determined to draw him from it. The execution of this purpose embraced the relief of the <orgName n="Shenandoah Valley" type="newspaper">Shenandoah Valley</orgName> from the troops that had occupied the lower part of it during the <rs type="season">winter</rs> and <rs type="season">spring</rs>, and, it practicable, the transfer of the scene of hostilities north of the <rs>Potomac</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> It was thought that the corresponding movements on the part of the enemy to which <hi rend="italics">those</hi> contemplated by us would probably give rise, might offer a fair opportunity to strike a blow at the army therein commanded by <persName n="Hooker,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Hooker</surname></persName>, and that in any event that army would be compelled to leave <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and possibly to draw to its support troops designed to operate against other parts of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>In this way it was supposed that the enemy's plan of campaign for the summer would be broken up, and part of the season of active operations be consumed in the formation of new combinations and the preparations that they would require. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> In addition to these advantages it was hoped that other valuable results might be attained by military success. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> Actuated by these and other important considerations that may hereafter be presented, the movement began on the <date value="06-03">3d June.</date> <orgName n="division"><persName n="McLaws,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:McLaws,nomatch:0"><surname>McLaws</surname></persName>'s division</orgName>, of <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName>, left <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> for <placeName reg="Culpeper Court House">Culpeper C.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> They were followed on the <num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num> and <num value="5" type="ordinal">5th</num> by <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Ewell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Ewell,nomatch:0"><surname>Ewell</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName>, leaving that of <persName n="Hill,,A.,P.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="default:Hill,A.,P.,,"><foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName> to occupy our lines at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> The march of these troops having been discovered by the enemy on the afternoon of the <dateStruct value="--5"><day reg="5">5th</day></dateStruct>, and the following day he crossed a force, amounting to about <num value="1">one</num> <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName>, to the south side of the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> on a pontoon bridge laid down near the mouth of <placeName reg="Deep Run, Page, Virginia" key="tgn,2281284">Deep Run</placeName>. <persName n="Hill,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="nearbymention:Hill,A.,P.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName> disposed his command to resist their advance; but as they seemed intended for the purpose of observation rather than attack, the movements in progress were not arrested. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> The forces of <persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName> and <persName n="Ewell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Ewell,nomatch:0"><surname>Ewell</surname></persName> reached <placeName reg="Culpeper Court House">Culpeper Court House</placeName> by the <num value="8" type="ordinal">8th</num>, at which point the cavalry under <persName n="Stuart,,Gen,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="default:Stuart,Gen,,,"><foreName>Gen</foreName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> was also concentrated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> On the <dateStruct value="--9"><day reg="2">9th</day></dateStruct> a large force of Federal cavalry strongly supported by infantry, crossed the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> at <placeName reg="Beverly's ford">Beverly's</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kelly's Ford, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2112479">Kelly's fords</placeName>, and attacked <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>A severe engagement ensued, continuing from early in the morning until late in the afternoon, when the enemy was forced to recross the river with heavy loss, leaving <measure n="400" type="prisoners">400 prisoners</measure>, <num value="3">three</num> pieces of artillery and several colors in our hands. </p>
