<head>Affairs in the <rs type="place">Valley</rs> &mdash; vandalism of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, &#x0026;c.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> From all the information we have, the enemy have now a considerable force in the <rs type="place">Lower Valley</rs>, around <placeName reg="Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015010">Charlestown</placeName> and <placeName reg="Martinsburg, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119135">Martinsburg</placeName>, and it is the impression of parties who have recently escaped from that section, that they are making preparations for a movement up the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>In the portions of the country occupied by them they are treating the people with marked kindness, allowing their troops to cut and haul wood to the citizens of <placeName reg="Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015010">Charlestown</placeName> and <placeName reg="Martinsburg, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119135">Martinsburg</placeName>, and furnishing to many of the farmers a guard for their property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Still some of the fiends among them are perpetrating the most brutal acts of vandalism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Some <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> ago, when the body of <persName n="Blackford,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Blackford,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Blackford</surname></persName>, of the <rs>Confederate</rs> service, who was killed at <placeName reg="Pocomoke City, Worcester, Maryland" key="tgn,2048325">Newtown</placeName>, was taken to <placeName reg="Jefferson, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002269">Jefferson</placeName>, it was delivered over to his friends, who came to <placeName reg="Charlestown, Boston, Suffolk" key="tgn,7015010">Charlestown</placeName> for it. That night <num value="2">two</num> farm houses, in <num value="1">one</num> or the other of which they believed his body to be lying, were burned to the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Both of these houses belonged to and were occupied by widow ladies and their families--<num value="1">one</num> of them a sister-in-law of <persName n="Blackford,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Blackford,nomatch:0"><surname>Blackford</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> A few days ago, some of our forces visited <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> and arrested a Union man named <persName n="Dooley,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Dooley,nomatch:0"><surname>Dooley</surname></persName>, who had been acting as a detective in the <rs>Lincoln</rs> service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>When arrested, he had in his possession about <measure n="3000dollars" type="currency">$3,000</measure> in &#x0022;greenbacks,&#x0022; which he was entrusted to use as a <orgName n="Secret Service Fund" type="fund">secret service fund</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>He offered <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">$1,000</measure> of this for his release.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The next day the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> visited <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> and arrested and carried off as hostages, <persName n="Williams,,Philip,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="default:Williams,Philip,,,"><foreName>Philip</foreName> <surname>Williams</surname></persName> and <persName n="Conrad,,Robert,Y.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="default:Conrad,Robert,Y.,,"><foreName>Robert</foreName> <foreName>Y.</foreName> <surname>Conrad</surname></persName>, <rs type="role">Esq.</rs>, the most influential citizens of the place. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> Along the <placeName key="tgn,2658280" n="1.000 17" reg="shenandoah river, united states, north and central america">Shenandoah river</placeName>, in <placeName reg="Jefferson county, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002269">Jefferson</placeName> and <placeName reg="Clarke, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002153">Clarke counties</placeName>, a regular band of robbers has been organized, composed of deserters from our army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>This band employs its time and supports itself by plundering farmers and others, and their deeds of outrage cause them to be more dreaded than the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>About <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure> ago a party of this band met <num value="2">two</num> ladies in a rockaway, on the turnpike near <placeName reg="Berryville, Clarke, Virginia" key="tgn,2110642">Berryville</placeName> in <placeName reg="Clarke, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002153">Clarke county</placeName>, and robbed them of everything they had, stripping them of every article of clothing upon their persons, even to their shoes and stockings, compelling, them to walk a distance of <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> to their homes without clothing, on a bitter cold evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>They also stole the horse from the rockaway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>A short time after this occurrence, the leader of the band, a men named Longerbeam, was captured by our scouts, who attempted to bring him through the lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>On the way he became obstinate, and finally made an effort to escape, when he was fired upon by the party guarding him, and pierced with <num value="3">three</num> balls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>He was taken to a house near by, where he died about <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> after.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Before his death, however, he made a full confession of his guilt, and gave the names of about <num value="20">twenty</num> others composing the band.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Among these, are the names of several who have heretofore been unsuspected. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> In all the election districts of <placeName reg="Jefferson county, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002269">Jefferson county</placeName>, enrolling and recruiting offices have been opened by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and the names of negroes who had fled, and their masters who are in the <rs>Confederate</rs> service, are being recorded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/><placeName key="tgn,2063301" n="1.000 1" reg="charlestown, sullivan, new hampshire">In Charlestown</placeName> the enrolling office is under the control and is conducted by a man named <persName n="Robey,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Robey,nomatch:0"><surname>Robey</surname></persName>, who at the commencement of the war was a captain of militia.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>When the militia from that county were called out and ordered to <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> in the summer of '<num value="61">61</num>, this fellow went with has company, but soon resigned because of the sport made of him by the boys in the regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Subsequently he ran off, but has now returned to do the filthy work of his Northern masters, and for such work he is about the best man that could have been found in that region. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> When <orgName n="command"><persName n="Imboden,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Imboden,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Imboden</surname></persName>'s command</orgName> went down to <placeName reg="Bunker Hill, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117622">Bunker Hill</placeName>, about the <date value="01-01">first of January</date>, a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> force was sent up from <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> to intercept his movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The night was very cold, a portion of the force got on a spree, and <num value="15">fifteen</num> of them were so badly frozen as to require amputation of their limbs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/><num value="5">Five</num> of them afterwards died at <placeName reg="Charles Town, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117756">Charlestown</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/><persName n="Decie,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Decie,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Decie</surname></persName> came to <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> shortly after the commencement of the war, with the <term type="ship">yacht</term> <rs type="ship">Monitor</rs>, which he sold to this Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>He afterwards went to <placeName reg="Montgomery, Maryland, United States" key="tgn,7016104">Montgomery county</placeName> and settled there, since which time several of his children have died and been buried there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>He commenced his business operations in this city by selling a bill of &#x00A3;<num value="5000">5,000</num> on the <name>Bank</name> of <placeName key="tgn,7000490;tgn,2140674" n="0.012 000000.3840	placename;tgn,7000490;australia,Oceania;0.010 000000.3301	placename;tgn,2140674;australia island, madison, louisiana,Madison,Louisiana,United States,North and Central America" reg="australia,Oceania;australia island, madison, louisiana,Madison,Louisiana,United States,North and Central America">Australia</placeName>, and referred the parties he sold it to a firm in <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, who, being applied to, endorsed <rs type="role2">Capt</rs>. D. as a responsible and honorable man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The bills he has drawn and sold to parties in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> will amount to about <num value="1000000">one million</num> <measure n="200000dollars" type="currency">two hundred thousand dollars</measure>. <num value="1">One</num> of the firms to whom he sold these bills, <orgName><persName n="Foster,Mister,R.,T.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="default:Foster,R.,T.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <surname>Foster</surname></persName> &#x0026; Co.</orgName>, have received a protest of the <num value="1">one</num> which they bought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>They promptly attached his property, near the <rs type="place">Montgomery White Sulphur Springs</rs>, and thus secured themselves from loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Other parties in the city have received notices of protest of the bills they bought, though not the protests themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/><persName n="Harrison,Mister,Samuel,J.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="default:Harrison,Samuel,J.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Samuel</foreName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>Harrison</surname></persName> requests us to state that he is not the <rs>Samuel Harrison</rs> noticed by the <hi rend="italics"><rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginian</rs></hi> as having been swindled by Decie.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> It is proper and just to state that several business men in the city, who have had transactions with Decie, still have the most entire confidence in him, and think that the protests resulted from the fact that the parties he drew on, in consequence of the difficulties of communication, had not been advised of his draft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>He did not leave the country under suspicious circumstances, but his intended departure was known in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> long before it took place, and he made no secret of it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>All this must have been a dream, engendered by the excited state of the public mind for the last <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, and the crimination and recriminations which have passed between estranged and unnatural brethren.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>A like effect seems to have been produced upon the venerable <rs>Kendall</rs>, (now we should think about the age of Methuselah,) and the apparition has been so much like daylight life that he begins, like ourselves, to fear that he is awake, and that all this is not an oppressive nightmare, but a horrid reality. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>They evidently look upon the visions which more or less have visited all men's minds, of blood, slaughter, desolation, groans, and wailing, as mere phantasmagoria, illusions of the eye and ear &mdash; possibly, even forerunners of coming insanity, which may, however, be averted by a judicious course of treatment.
