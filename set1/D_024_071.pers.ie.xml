<head>The late <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> advance on the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> From papers found on the field of the late conflict it would seem that the recent advance of the enemy on the line of the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> was designed as something more than a more reconnaissance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>These papers disclose the fact, if we are correctly informed, that the expedition was, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, for the destruction of the <rs type="place">Central Road</rs> at <placeName key="tgn,2111971" n="1.000 34" reg="gordonsville, orange, virginia">Gordonsville</placeName> by tearing up as much of the track of that road, either way from the above point, as might be found convenient in the time allowed them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>From thence they were to proceed to the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James River</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kanawha Canal">Kanawha Canal</placeName>, which they were expected to strike at or near <placeName reg="Columbia, Richland, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013641">Columbia</placeName>, In <persName n="Fluvanna,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:Fluvanna,nomatch:0"><surname>Fluvanna</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Thence, crossing the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>, their course was laid out through <placeName reg="Cumberland, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002156">Cumberland county</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7014170" n="1.000 62" reg="farmville, prince edward, virginia">Farmville</placeName>, or the <rs type="place">High Bridge</rs> over the <rs>Appomattox</rs>, near that place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The destruction of this bridge was <num value="1">one</num> of the pet objects of the expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>After the accomplishment of this feat the expedition was to work itself out of difficulty by passing round between <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> and the <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> line, so as to strike be <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> lines in the neighborhood of <placeName reg="Suffolk, Suffolk, Virginia" key="tgn,2114436">Suffolk</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> Impossible of accomplishment as this feat would seem to be the distance to travel and the risks to run are no greater than those incurred by the dating <rs>Morgan</rs> in some of his raids in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>But the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> not only lacked a Morgan to execute this bold scheme, but met with such men as <persName n="Stuart,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,nomatch:0"><surname>Stuart</surname></persName> and <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, whose vigilance is a sure guarantee that no <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> laid into our lines can ever be successfully undertaken. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> At the request of the <rs type="role" reg="District Attorney">District Attorney</rs>, a decision upon the application was postponed, to allow <persName n="Claiborne,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="nearbymention:Claiborne,John,H.,,"><surname>Claiborne</surname></persName> opportunity to show cause why the injunction should not be granted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/><persName n="Claiborne,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="nearbymention:Claiborne,John,H.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Claiborne</surname></persName> has filed an answer to the bill, in which he alleges that under the orders of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> he has impressed a considerable quantity of flour, including that claimed by <persName n="Isaacs,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="nearbymention:Isaacs,Wm,B.,,"><surname>Isaacs</surname></persName>; that the flour was believed to be necessary for the use of the army in the field, and that price proposed to be paid therefore was believed by many to be just compensation; that his own fortune was ample to satisfy any demand which <persName n="Isaacs,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="nearbymention:Isaacs,Wm,B.,,"><surname>Isaacs</surname></persName> might have against him, but that as he had acted under orders of the <rs>Government</rs>, it would be bound to stand between him and damage; and with his answer he has fled an order from the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> to the <rs type="role" reg="Commissary-General">Commissary General</rs>, dated in <date value="1862-12">December, 1862</date> authorizing the <rs type="role" reg="Commissary-General">Commissary General</rs> to impress flour, &#x0026; c, and fixing a maximum price to be paid and an order from the <rs type="role" reg="Commissary-General">Commissary General</rs> instructing him to impress flour at the price fixed by the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> In the argument of the ease it has been contended by the counsel for the <rs>Government</rs> that an injunction ought not to be awarded: <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Because the bill was defective in not charging that <persName n="Claiborne,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="nearbymention:Claiborne,John,H.,,"><surname>Claiborne</surname></persName> had impressed the flour; it only stated that the petitioners was &#x0022;informed&#x0022; he had done so.--<num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Because the proper parties were not before the <rs type="place">Court</rs>; that as the impressment was said to have been made under the orders of the <rs>Government</rs> the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, as the principal Executive officer of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, ought to have been made a party <hi rend="italics">defendant.</hi> <num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Because the answer alleges that the flour was impressed by <persName n="Claiborne,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="nearbymention:Claiborne,John,H.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Claiborne</surname></persName> on the ground that it was necessary for the use of the army in the field, and that in cases of extreme necessity an officer of the <rs>Government</rs> has a right to take private property for public use, and cannot under such Circumstances be considered a trespasser, but that the party injured must look to the <rs>Government</rs> for compensation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/><num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>That even if <persName n="Claiborne,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="nearbymention:Claiborne,John,H.,,"><surname>Claiborne</surname></persName> had no authority to impress the flour, the petitioner had a complete and adequate remedy at law, by action of <unclear>detince </unclear> or trespass. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The objections to the form of the bill are not well talent, because even if the bill were defective in not charging more distinctly that <persName n="Claiborne,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="nearbymention:Claiborne,John,H.,,"><surname>Claiborne</surname></persName> had impressed the flour, that defect would be cured by the answer of the defendant, in which be not only admits that he had impressed it, but attempts to justify the act. It was not necessary to make the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> a party defendant, because when several persons unite in committing a trespass the injured party has the privilege of suing any <num value="1">one</num>, or all, of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The bill does not, however charge that the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> had authorized the impressment; it only states that <persName n="Claiborne,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="nearbymention:Claiborne,John,H.,,"><surname>Claiborne</surname></persName> alleged that he had acted under such orders. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The counsel for the <rs>Government</rs> have argued most currently in support of the doctrine that a military officer has, in cases of extreme necessity, a right to seize private property for public use, and that under such circumstances, he cannot be considered a trespasser, and that the owner of the property can only look to the <rs>Government</rs> for compensation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>This proposition has been asserted by many legal writers and received the sanction of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></orgName> in the case of <persName n="Mitchell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Mitchell,nomatch:0"><surname>Mitchell</surname></persName> vs. Harmony (<num value="13" type="ordinal">13th</num> <persName n="Howard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Howard,nomatch:0"><surname>Howard</surname></persName>, p. --.) </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> I do not think that this question arises upon the pleadings in this case, because even those writers who claim the existence of such a right, admit that it can only be exercised &#x0022;where the necessity is urgent for the public service, such as will not admit of delay; and where the action of the civil authority would be too late in providing the means which the occasion calls for. It is the <hi rend="italics">emergency</hi> that gives the right, and the emergency must be shown to exist before the taking can be justified&#x0022; [<num value="13">13</num> <persName n="Howard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Howard,nomatch:0"><surname>Howard</surname></persName>, <ref n="page 134">P. 134</ref>. <persName n="Paley,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Paley,nomatch:0"><surname>Paley</surname></persName>, ch. <num value="40">XL</num>, <ref n="page 83">p. 83</ref>.] The evidence in this care does not show the existence of any such &#x0022;emergency,&#x0022; but on the contrary, in my opinion, it proves that it did not exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The order of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> to the <rs type="role" reg="Commissary-General">Commissary General</rs>, authorizing him to impress subsistence, &#x0026; c, was written on the <date value="1862-12-29">29th of December, 1862, </date> and does not appear to have been caused by a want of food for the army, or an inability to purchase it at the market price, but because the <rs>Government</rs> could not buy at prices which the officers considered &#x0022;reasonable.&#x0022;--A maximum price was fixed for all articles, and the <rs type="role" reg="Commissary-General">Commissary General</rs> authorized to impress the property, at an arbitrary valuation, whenever he should think it necessary for the public service.
