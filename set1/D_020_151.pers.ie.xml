<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> Today our whole army is engaged in building log houses for winter quarters, or in moving to sites already selected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Several brigades will remain where they now are, near the fortifications in <placeName reg="Centreville, Queen Annes, Maryland" key="tgn,2046543">Centreville</placeName>, and the remainder will fall back a mile or <num value="2">two</num> upon <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>. --<persName n="Smith,General,Kirby,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="default:Smith,Kirby,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <foreName>Kirby</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>'s <orgName n="brigade">brigade</orgName> is at <q>&#x0022;<placeName reg="Camp Wigfall">Camp Wigfall</placeName>,&#x0022;</q> to the right of the <placeName reg="Orange, Orange, Virginia" key="tgn,7014299">Orange</placeName> and <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName> road, near the <rs type="place">Run</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Near by, the whole of <persName n="Dorn,,,,,Van" id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Dorn,nomatch:0"><nameLink>Van</nameLink> <surname>Dorn</surname></persName>'s <orgName n="division">division</orgName> are making themselves comfortable in their little cottages which rise rapidly day by day, under the diligent hands of the soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>A few brigades are scattered down towards the <rs>Occoquan</rs>, where wood and water is plenty, the farthest being by <placeName reg="Davis's Ford">Davis's Ford</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The artillery, with the exception of <orgName n="battalion"><persName n="Walton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Walton,nomatch:0"><surname>Walton</surname></persName>'s battalion</orgName>, has already been located between <placeName reg="Centreville, Louisa, Virginia" key="tgn,2230916">Cub Run</placeName> and <placeName reg="Stone Bridge, Clarke, Virginia" key="tgn,2114394">Stone Bridge</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The cavalry has fallen back a little and they are now building stables and houses near <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The artillerists, detailed to man the guns in the batteries, will also remain by the fortifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>In case of an attack by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, it will take about <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> to get the main strength of the army across <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Information of an approach would be given at least <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> before an enemy could come up, and in that time we could be well prepared to resist any force that can be brought up. That is about the situation of affairs for the winter, and it remains to be seen whether our men are to have an opportunity of a brush with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, or whether they will be allowed to enjoy their new houses in quietness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>When I say all are ready for an attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>I express but feebly the feeling which pervades the army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> Yesterday I rode over the battle-field of the <num value="21" type="ordinal">21st</num> for the purpose of making sketches and gathering relics for a fair friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The day was clear but cold, and the wind blew across the plains as sharp as Shy lock's knife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>What a scene of desolation was spread out to our view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/><rs type="season">Autumn</rs> and <rs type="season">winter</rs> have wrought many changes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The trees are bare and leafless, the golden-rods flame no longer by the wayside; the ice-bound streams are slumbering in their beds; the birds sing no more, and even the lazy buzzard has ceased to wheel his circles over the deserted fields.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The <rs type="place">Henry House</rs> still stands, although more than had; destroyed; beside it the fatal field &mdash; silent, solemn, cold, the befits the tomb of more than <num value="200">two hundred</num> men. How full of recollections was the spot to me!. The rose bushes by the floor, the corn stubble in the garden, the withered grass, the shattered house, all were aids to my memory, and assisted in busying the mind with retrospection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>What trivial things bring back the acts and scenes of former life!. A simple flower, noteless to others, brings up vivid recollections of some bygone bale or bliss; a single glance at alien cornfields recalls the form and features of the fair <rs>Ruth</rs> of our boy hood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Ah! how well do I remember the hour spent upon this same spot upon the evening of that bloody day, when the ground was strewn with dead and dying men who had fallen in the fight; when poor, wounded, suffering beings moaned in the agonies of death, and called upon <name n="God" type="God">God</name> for mercy and pronounced the name of some far-off mother, perhaps even then praying for the safety of her absent son. The gibbous moon rose clean above the horizon, and for an hour shone as if in mockery upon the pale and ghastly features of the dead, then plunged into the black masses of clouds, whose dark battalions chased each other along the sky. Soon after, thick darkness covered the scene and closed the tragedy of the day &mdash; a day the pen of history will recall when those who saw it have lain is century dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>How terrible is war!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>How terrible to think even of the loss of life that war entails!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>But yet, where is the man who would not prefer death to dishonor, or the manly heart that would not hazard its life-blood to maintain the honor of his country? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> The day grew chill and blustering, and as sketching with fingers stiffened and benumbed with cold is a difficult task, that part of the expedition was abandoned, and we turned our horses towards camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>I would like to give a description of the present appearance of the battle- field, but mere words would fail to give the correct idea of it to be gained by accurate maps and drawings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Up to this time none have been issued worthy a glance, or that are not better calculated to mislead than to instruct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>I am happy to learn, however, that a book, with maps to fold in it, is now in press, and will be issued at an early day. <persName n="Warder,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Warder,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Warder</surname></persName> and <persName n="Catlett,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Catlett,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Catlett</surname></persName>, both practical surveyors of this vicinity, are preparing for publication maps of the battle grounds of <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName> and <placeName reg="Manassas Plains">Manassas Plains</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>They have both spent many days in taking the bearings and distances of all the roads, the meanders of the streams, the position of every piece or body of woods, and the location of every house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>To this is added the position of the troops during the battle, given in conventional signs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>A competent draftsman was employed to give an exact delineation of the surface of the grounds in hill and valley.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The context is compiled from the reports of officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>If this book and the maps prove correct, it will meet with a ready sale, and I shall take the earliest opportunity after its publication of examining it and of giving my opinion to those who choose to receive it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> <dateStruct value="-12-24"><occasion>Christmas eve</occasion></dateStruct> I made a flying trip up the country, and spent a few hours with some friends at <placeName reg="Front Royal, Warren, Virginia" key="tgn,2111870">Front Royal</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Starting late in the evening, we arrived at <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time>, and after spending a few happy hours, returned by the train at <num value="3">three</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Riding entirely in the night, I was unable to learn much of the country or the town, but fancied it very pleasant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The journey back by moonlight was delightful, and I was reminded of a little <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> poem which I have translated, and beg to introduce here. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/> The principal intelligence conveyed by the <name>Edinburg</name> from <placeName reg="America, Wabash, Indiana" key="tgn,2131960">America</placeName> consists in the message of the <rs>President</rs> of the <rs>Southern Confederation</rs>, and we are glad to notice the friendly tone in which it treats of the relations of the <rs>South</rs> with this country, while we are embarked in a critical negotiation with the <rs>North</rs>; and while we are also about to enter upon our intervention in <placeName reg="Mexico, Audrain, Missouri" key="tgn,2059719">Mexico</placeName>, a country bordering upon the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>This is, in fact, the only satisfactory and significant information that the present <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> packet has brought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>The <q>&#x0022;<persName n="Trent,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Trent,nomatch:0"><surname>Trent</surname></persName> question&#x0022;</q> remains in <hi rend="italics">statu quo.</hi> The opinion of the law officers of the <rs>Washington Cabinet</rs>, which is now repeated, had reached us by the <name>Persia</name> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> last; but the popular excitement which the question had provoked appears to have in some measure cooled down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>For the moment, therefore, Southern politics arrest our chief attention. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/> The Message of <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> to the <orgName n="Southern Congress" type="congress">Southern Congress</orgName> is, in our judgment, the more satisfactory for the firm and determined attitude in which it confronts the <rs n="Unionist" type="political">Unionist</rs> party and the <rs>Cabinet</rs> of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>; for if we concede the conquest of the <rs>South</rs> be next to impossible, it is by the exhibition of Southern strength rather than of Southern weakness that peace is to be restored between the <num value="2">two</num> belligerents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/><persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> recounts that throughout <measure n="7months" type="date">seven months</measure> of hostilities the confederates have almost uniformly held their own, and that in several instances they have thrown their opponents into a defensive attitude. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/> <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> is therefore fully entitled to the bold ground which he assumes when he declares that <q>&#x0022;the <rs>South</rs> will be content to live at peace with the <rs>North</rs>, but that the separation is final.&#x0022;</q> He adds that the <rs>South</rs> will accept of no compromise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>He is now, perhaps for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, in a position to make use of this language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Indeed, <num value="1">one</num> is led to ask, after the trial and exhaustion of so many designs, and the expenditure of so much money on the part of the <rs>North</rs>, what is yet to introduce decisive features into the campaign?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>The federals have enjoyed immense advantages in point of men and money, and also (as we showed yesterday) in drawing warlike supplies from this country, through their superior command of the sea. <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> will no doubt derive fresh confidence when he reads the <num value="2">two</num> royal proclamations which, in the latter respect, have now placed the <name>North</name> and <name>South</name> on a footing of equality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>But there has been scarcely a single State over run by the <rs>Northern</rs> army during the whole course of the campaign, and it is much questioned whether the naval expeditions of the federal government to <placeName key="tgn,3000601" n="1.000 10" reg="cape hatteras, dare, north carolina">Hatteras</placeName> and <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName> have done much more than slightly to reduce the privateering activity of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>The assertion of the <rs>Southern President</rs> must, therefore, he admitted to be substantially true, that <q>&#x0022;the reconstruction of the <rs>Union</rs>, which the <rs>Federals</rs> seek to effect by force of arms, has become more and more palpably impossible.&#x0022; </q> He maintains, also, that the causes which brought about the separation not only remain in full force, but have been strengthened since the civil war began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>With a view of observing strict neutrality between the contending States, we have carefully refrained from officially recognizing the <rs>South</rs>; but the time has certainly arrived at which we cease altogether to believe in the possible reunion of the <name>States</name>, and at which we must, at all events, recognize the independent confederation of the <rs>South</rs> as an actual fact. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/> <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> speaks with just indignation of the seizure of his Envoys to the <rs>Courts</rs> of <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>; and there is a passage in this part of his message which throws a probable light on the distinctive mission on which <persName n="Slidell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Slidell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Slidell</surname></persName> and <persName n="Mason,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:Mason,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Mason</surname></persName> were sent to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>He remarks, with some evident pride, that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> have been content to fight their own battle, and have solicited no assistance from foreign Powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>But he declares that they have a right to bring before <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> the question of the application of the existing blockades of their own ports to the acknowledged principle of international law, that blockades, if they are to be respected by <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> Powers, must be effective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>He is about to represent to the <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> Governments, accordingly, the total inefficiency of these blockades, and to put the assertion upon evidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>It is a fair inference that this was <num value="1">one</num> of the questions upon which <persName n="Slidell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Slidell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Slidell</surname></persName> and <persName n="Mason,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Mason,nomatch:0"><surname>Mason</surname></persName> were sent to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/> But there is another statement in our present <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> intelligence which threatens to put the blockade question in a light altogether new. It is announced that <num value="25">twenty-five</num> vessels have set sail, apparently from New York, heavily loaded with stones, with the view of their being sunk at the mouth of a Southern harbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>Now, in all probability ingress or egress would be as difficult at a Southern port, with <num value="5">five</num>-and-<num value="20">twenty</num> sunken vessels in front of the harbor, as it was at <placeName reg="Sebastopol, Luzerne, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2650582">Sebastopol</placeName>, where the <name>Russians</name> sank several of their ships with the view of preventing the entrance of <name>English</name> and <name>French</name> vessels of war. But if the <rs>Federal Government</rs> desire by this expedient to relieve their own ships by thus blocking up Southern ports, they must be perfectly aware <hi rend="italics">that there is at once an end of the blockade in every instance in which their new plan is to apply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Sunken vessels will not constitute a blockade, let them be as <sic> as</sic><q>&#x0022;effective&#x0022;</q> as they may; and wherever the <rs>Federal Government</rs> shall thus substitute sunken vessels for its ships-of-war, then the blockade is at once terminated by the consent of all nations.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/> We draw attention to the rational and friendly manner in which the <rs>Southern President</rs> alludes to the attitude maintained hither to towards <placeName reg="America, Wabash, Indiana" key="tgn,2131960">America</placeName> by this country, because we regard our relations with the <rs>Southern States</rs> as henceforward of very considerable importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>These States have now attained such a position that we must bring ourselves to believe in the permanence of their independent confederation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>We have differences with the <rs>North</rs> in which the <name>Southerners</name> are directly interested; and we have just concluded a treaty with the <rs>Juarez Government</rs> of <placeName reg="Mexico, Audrain, Missouri" key="tgn,2059719">Mexico</placeName> for a settlement of our long-standing claims upon that country, under the <q>&#x0022;Aldham Convention,&#x0022;</q> and other recorded obligations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>Our naval expedition to the <placeName reg="Gulf of Mexico" key="tgn,7021009">Gulf of Mexico</placeName> is charged with the execution of these terms; and, probably, before <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> next the system of sequestration of customs revenue at <placeName reg="Vera Cruz, Douglas, Missouri" key="tgn,2744101">Vera Cruz</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1018380" n="1.000 4" reg="tampico,tamaulipas,mexico,north and central america">Tampico</placeName> will have been put into action, and the proceeds be accumulating for distribution under the mixed commission between the despoiled residents and the wrong bondholders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>We must look upon this intervention as <num value="1">one</num> that may be in operation during a considerable period of time; and while the <rs>Northern Government</rs> is too distant to admit of its attitude entering materially into this question, the <rs>Southern</rs> confederation, on the other hand, stretches for a great distance along the frontier of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, so as to render its friendly disposition to the authors of the intervention of no slight consequence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>The Northern Government has invariably railed at our neutrality; but the <rs>Southern</rs>, with statesmanship and moderation, has recognized in it all that we could do for either party, and whether with a view to our transactions in <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, or to our relations with the <rs>Cabinet</rs> of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, the friendly forbearance of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> is an important point in our favor. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>The summary given of the <rs>Southern Message</rs> shows it to be a State paper of great interest and importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>Its author has always been recognized, even by his enemies, as <num value="1">one</num> of the most vigorous and astute politicians that <placeName reg="America, Wabash, Indiana" key="tgn,2131960">America</placeName> has produced, and he is especially remarkable for literary skill in compositions of this kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>We may expect, therefore, that the dignity of the <rs>South</rs> will not suffer from the pen of its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <rs type="role2">President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>The message of a few months since was an able apology for secession, and a vigorous exhortation to </p> <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/> unity and courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>The present message seems to be a congratulation on victories achieved, and an announcement that the national independence may be considered secure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>And certainly a less accomplished writer than <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00031" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> might become eloquent with the history of the past year as his subject. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/> But the part of the message which at this moment is especially interesting is that which refers to the seizure of the <rs>Confederate Commissioners</rs> and the relations between the <num value="2">two</num> republic and the great Powers of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>It is plain that <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00032" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> discerns the cloud which is forming on this side of the <rs>Atlantic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/><q>&#x0022;The claim of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to seize them in the streets of <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>,&#x0022;</q> says <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00033" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, <q>&#x0022;would have been as well founded as the seizure on board the <rs type="ship">Trent</rs>.&#x0022;</q> As far as we learn by telegraph, he does not presume to give us advice or to say that we are bound to demand reparation, but we cannot help thinking that the probability of a rupture between <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and the <rs>North</rs> inspires the <rs>President</rs> to use a high tone with respect to foreign assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/><q>&#x0022;The Confederates,&#x0022;</q> says <persName n="Davis,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, <q>&#x0022;ask no aid from foreign Powers.&#x0022;</q> This is just the language which a new State must hold if it wishes to give its neighbors an excuse for recognizing its independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>The only consideration in such a case is whether the community which demands to be recognized has the force and consistency which entitle it to recognition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>If it be <hi rend="italics">de facts</hi> a nation, if it prove that it can maintain its own independence, then other Governments are justified in communication with it diplomatically, and treating it as a member of the family of nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>But if it calls on the world to help it, it does by this very act take away the right of neutral Powers to treat if as an equal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>It proclaims that the <rs>State</rs> against which it has revolted still has the power to conquer it, and consequently it is the duty of neutrals to consider it merely as a province in a State of insurrection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/> As to the general course of events, in the present hour of suspense any ordinary news from <placeName reg="America, Wabash, Indiana" key="tgn,2131960">America</placeName> must seem flat and uninteresting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>We feel that we are divided by a great gulf from the time before the outrage on the <rs>Trent</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>The events of the war which excited our curiosity a fortnight ago now lose much of their interest, since we know that their import is now subordinate to a larger issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>While the <num value="2">two</num> parties are carrying on their usual desultory warfare &mdash; this side bombarding a Confederate sea-port, that side burning a Federal town &mdash; we know that a message is on its way from <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> to <placeName reg="America, Wabash, Indiana" key="tgn,2131960">America</placeName>, the reception of which may change the civil war into a great and world-wide struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>Nothing can interest us now unless it relates to the <num value="1">one</num> question &mdash; Will <persName n="Mason,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00036" reg="mostcommon:Mason,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Mason</surname></persName> and <persName n="Slidell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00037" reg="mostcommon:Slidell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Slidell</surname></persName> be given up? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/> Everything that bears on this will be greedily read by the <rs>British</rs> public; everything that tends to show the temper of the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs>, or to give a clue to the intentions of their government, will be minutely investigated and discussed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>Unhappily, the dispatches we publish to-day give little information on this point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>So far as we are able to judge from them, the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> seem to be unconscious of the momentous controversy which they have raised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>It is said that an uneasy feeling prevails, but we cannot but think that, being so accustomed to find the <rs>British</rs> give way in similar cases, they will in a few days have taken it for granted that everything is right, and that after a little grumbling <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> will acquiesce, not only in what they have done, but in what they announce their intention of doing. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/> The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> royal proclamation, forbidding the export of arms and other warlike stores not included in the former., has followed its predecessor not a day too soon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>With whatever view the <rs>Cabinet</rs> of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> has been engaged in buying up all our purchasable means of offence and defence, after a fashion that <persName n="Dickens,,Charles,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00038" reg="default:Dickens,Charles,,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Dickens</surname></persName> would describe as <q>&#x0022;wholesale, retail, and for exportation.&#x0022;</q> By much or by little, whatever was to be obtained for money was about to be purchased and shipped for <placeName reg="America, Wabash, Indiana" key="tgn,2131960">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>The export of these <num value="3000">three thousand</num> tons was arrested by the former proclamation, probably just in time. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/> Mean while, however, the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> government had been purchasing small arms on a scale somewhat less vast, or with so much more discretion, at least, that the fact had not become notorious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>What the immediate success of this agent's commission to the manufacturers in <placeName reg="Birmingham, Birmingham, England" key="tgn,7010955">Birmingham</placeName> and elsewhere may have been we do not know, but if he were prepared to pay the cost in cash &mdash; which he was very probably armed with the means of doing &mdash; it may be assumed that no difficulty presented itself in the completion of the contract so far as the manufacturers were concerned. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/> But so prompt and decisive has been the action of our Government, that before this latter agent of the <rs>Federal Cabinet</rs> had set foot for <measure n="48hours" type="date">forty-eight hours</measure> in this country, a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> proclamation has issued, forbidding the export of <q>&#x0022;arms, ammunition, <rs n="percussion caps" type="product">percussion caps</rs>, tubes, and lead.&#x0022;</q> This proclamation is dated <date value="12-04">Wednesday, Dec. 4, </date> and took the public by surprise yesterday morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>But for this rapid action, the goods in question would probably have been shipped, so far as they were ready prepared for use, by the end of the week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>The result is that this <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> gentleman is thrown upon his beam ends, and will probably return to New York by the next mail, with his cash in his pocket, and leaving the coveted arms and ammunition on <name>English</name> ground. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/> The object of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> certainly cannot be logically proved to have been that of a preparation for hostilities against ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>If, indeed, it were clear that this was their motive, the fact that their earlier orders had been issued before they had learned of the <rs type="place">San Jacinto</rs> affair would render their conduct peculiarly ominous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>It is, of course, possible that these immense orders may have been dictated by the exigency of their campaign against the <name>Southerners</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>They affect to keep an army of something like half a <num value="1000000">million</num> in the field; and although we doubt whether throughout their civil war so much blood has yet been shed as was shed in a single day at <placeName key="tgn,7005898" n="1.000 10" reg="Solferino,Mantova,Lombardia,Italia,Europe">Solferino</placeName>, the requirements of such an army, even in ammunition, must still be considerable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>The manner, however, in which the <rs>Federal Government</rs> has set to work on the present occasion is very unlike the purchases they have hitherto made in support of the civil war. The <num value="1">one</num> case differs from the other as much as a steamer taking in coals for a long voyage differs from a steamer supplying herself for a river trip on the <rs>Thames</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/> The Northern government knew very well that we sought no rupture with them, and that so long as their conduct to us was peaceable they might rely upon making, from time to time, whatever purchases they pleased.--<placeName reg="The Atlantic">The Atlantic</placeName> was always open to them, and they had no more dread of the few Confederate vessels of war on the ocean at <num value="1">one</num> time than at another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>Moreover, they could read-fly send their stores of war on all occasions under convoy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>Neither is this country the only <num value="1">one</num> from which saltpetre is to be had. Of the <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> tons which we annually import, some <num value="12000">twelve thousand</num> tons are sent from <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName>, and the remaining <num value="8000">eight thousand</num> from <placeName key="tgn,1000049" n="1.000 3" reg="chile, south america">Chile</placeName> and Pern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>The South <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> markets, which are thus extremely prolific, must have been quite as much open to the importers in the <rs>Federal States</rs> as to ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>It is probable that the <rs>Washington</rs> government, therefore, could have bought saltpetre cheaper in <placeName reg="South America" key="tgn,1000002">South America</placeName> than they could have bought it here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>True, the transit in that case would have occupied longer time than it would in this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>Yet they could not have required <num value="3000">three thousand</num> tons for the purposes of their present civil war until they had time to send ships to <placeName reg="South America" key="tgn,1000002">South America</placeName> and receive them back again at least <num value="10">ten</num> times over. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/> We must remember also that this order for saltpetre was dispatched from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> before the exploit of <persName n="Wilkes,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00040" reg="mostcommon:Wilkes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Wilkes</surname></persName> had become known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>As soon as it did become known, a fresh agent, as we have teen, was at once sent here with orders to purchase rifles, lead, and percussion this, on a scale, it would appear, of corresponding magnitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>Once and for all is certainly, not the usual course with those who can cut and come again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>We do not desire to give these considerations <unclear>under influence</unclear> but they certainly imply a disposition to draw our teeth and then to tell us to bite if we can. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/> We shall not lose rejoice at this prompt intervention of our own Government, even if </p> <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/> our difficulty with the <rs>Northern States</rs> should be happily surmounted, and the civil war should be left as before to drag on its weary length.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>We have aimed at the maintenance of a <hi rend="italics">bone fide</hi> neutrality between the <num value="2">two</num> combatants. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/> A royal proclamation, a considerable period ago, warned <name>British</name> merchant captains to carry neither arms nor troops for either party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>Even in our official language we have abstained from anything more than regret for the existence of the contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>Northern and Southern ships have, as far as we are concerned, enjoyed the same facilities for the shipping of warlike stores in <name>British</name> ports.--But, in point of fact, there has existed the grossest inequality between the advantages of the <num value="2">two</num> combatants in this latter respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>The <rs>North</rs> have been supreme at sea, and they have also maintained a more or less effectual blockade of Southern ports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>Thus the <num value="1">one</num> party have enjoyed a practical immunity in the shipment of arms from this country, and the other party have been nearly excluded from our markets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>A Southern ship has <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to run the blockade at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> or New Orleans; it has then to make <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName> in spite of Northern cruisers; afterwards it has the same peril to encounter on the return voyage; and, finally, it has to run the blockade again and to enter its own port in safety. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/> The truth, therefore, is that the liberality and equality of our laws have operated to feed the war in the greatly preponderating interest of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>By the present proclamations this tendency is now at an end, and neither belligerent will receive arms or ammunition henceforward from these shores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>This is meting out even justice, at least, to both parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>But whatever were the designs of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, it is impossible to imagine any power more completely beaten in policy by its late outrage on our flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>It it were its aim in these purchases merely to provide for its campaign against the <rs>South</rs>, it has closed the door to its own factitious advantages over its antagonist in <name>British</name> ports; and if it were its aim to exhaust our own resources, it has put its design in practice just in time to be decisively defeated by the <num value="2">two</num> royal proclamations. </p> </div4> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/> For the last <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure>, this peninsula has been in a whirl of excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>Rumor after rumor in rapid succession has prevailed, of an immediate attack on <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>The rapid movement of troops from point to point, has led many to believe there was serious foundation for these rumors. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/> The military, almost without exception, have hoped there might be a fight on hand, for they are tired of the mere routine of the camp, and want something a little more stirring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>Besides, they say they came here to fight, and long to meet the invaders, not doubting the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>But some of the citizens &mdash; especially those without <q>&#x0022;the lines&#x0022;</q>--have been alarmed, not doubting that if the vandals do advance, the scenes which have been enacted in the vicinity of <placeName reg="Hampton, Hampton, Virginia" key="tgn,7013687">Hampton</placeName> would be repeated wherever the enemy should come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>As yet, however, no very decided move has been made.--The enemy seems to be satisfied to remain within his strong holds at <placeName reg="Old Point, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2557597">Old Point</placeName> and <orgName n="Newport News" type="newspaper">Newport News</orgName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>They were here met by a party of about <num value="300">three hundred</num> of the <orgName type="regiment" key="8ALRegiment">8th Alabama regiment</orgName>, (<persName n="Winston,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00041" reg="mostcommon:Winston,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Winston</surname></persName>'s,) and a skirmish ensued, in which, as usual, the enemy were repulsed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>Their loss I have not learned definitely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>Several, however, were seen to fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>Some prisoners were taken, and, as a trophy, a <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> flag was brought off by our men. <num value="1">One</num> man was killed and <measure n="2" type="wounded">two wounded</measure> on our side. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/> It is not necessary nor politic that any definite information should be given through the papers concerning the defences of this peninsula.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/> We have various reports, from persons who recently came through under a flag of truce, of the strength of the enemy's army at and approaching <placeName key="tgn,1124357" n="1.000 25" reg="green, kentucky, united states">Green River</placeName>, threatening <orgName n="command"><persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00205" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>'s command</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>From the best lights before us I am of opinion there is not over <num value="60000">sixty thousand</num> effective men on that line that could be brought into <num value="1">one</num> battle now or within the time an engagement is expected to take place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>The sickness in the enemy's camp is represented as very great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>Some of the regiments were said to be but little more than skeletons of what they were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>Still, the force aggregated in the neighborhood of <placeName key="tgn,1124357" n="1.000 25" reg="green, kentucky, united states">Green River</placeName> and within call is large, not to be despised, composed of good fighting men from <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and the <rs>Northwestern States</rs>, and well furnished with materials of war. <num value="16000">Sixteen</num> to <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> have crossed the river, and seem to be preparing to advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>If a battle were fought to-day, I do not think the enemy could bring into the field over <num value="30">thirty</num> or <num value="35000">thirty-five-thousand</num> men. To meet these we have <num value="20000">twenty</num> to <num value="25000">twenty-five thousand</num> of the best and bravest troops in the world &mdash; quite sufficient to whip the enemy, though they be more in number. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/> They have boasted they would eat their <dateStruct value="-12-25"><occasion>Christmas dinner</occasion></dateStruct> at <placeName reg="Bowling Green, Parke, Indiana" key="tgn,2031150">Bowling Green</placeName>, and soon after be in <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>This piece of characteristic gasconade has as little terror for our brave volunteers as the <q>&#x0022;on to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>&#x0022;</q> cry had. Nor do I hear of any families leaving <placeName reg="Bowling Green, Parke, Indiana" key="tgn,2031150">Bowling Green</placeName>, or packing up their things in <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName> for departure from fear of the gascons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>And should the enemy increase his force greatly, we can do the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>Under any and all circumstances, we can defend the line to <placeName reg="Bowling Green, Parke, Indiana" key="tgn,2031150">Bowling Green</placeName> and <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName> against any number that can be brought against us. More than that, we have no doubt of defeating them so thoroughly that we shall be able to advance into the country now held by them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>A battle is expected any day or hour, not only by the people, who in their excitement usually anticipate such an event, but also by the army officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>Such is the state of military affairs just now in that part of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>I am, however, skeptical about having any great, decisive battle there, as I have stated before in my communications to the <hi rend="italics">Dispatch.</hi> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/><persName><roleName n="Queen">Queen</roleName> <foreName>Victoria</foreName></persName>'s message, the prompt and decisive stand of her Government, the tone of the <rs>British</rs> press, and the popular voice show that the <rs>Lincoln</rs> despotism will either have to fight the old Lion or be humiliated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>We hope the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> will have as much back-bone, as they have egotism and fanaticism, for then there is sure to be war. This news has produced a considerable effect, already, upon the speculators in money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>Gold had gone up to <num value="0.4">forty per cent.</num>, and in some cases as high as <num value="50">fifty</num>, now it is not over <num value="30">thirty</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>Should there be a war- between <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, it would probably go down to-par or to small premium.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>The navy of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> would soon sweep away the blockade, and we should be supplied abundantly with money in exchange for our produce, and with the materials of war. We wait with intense interest the news from the <rs>North</rs> and from the other side of the <rs>Atlantic</rs>, to know how providentially the <rs>Mason</rs> and <rs>Slidell</rs> affair is working.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/> We are informed by a gentleman who is in the habit of sojourning at the hotels of <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> that a marked peculiarity of the public parlors is the presence of persons going North and returning thence by way of the flag of truce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>Many of the former are individuals born north of <placeName reg="Mason, Hillsborough, New Hampshire" key="tgn,2063592">Mason</placeName> and <placeName reg="Dixon, Lee, Illinois" key="tgn,2027503">Dixon</placeName>'s line, generally ladies and children who have been detained in the <rs>South</rs> by circumstances beyond control; and many of the latter are persons of foreign birth returning to their homes in the <rs>South</rs>, after a tour abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>It is a singular fact, deserving of mention as an honorable characteristic of Southern women, that few among those who have the misfortune to be married to Northern men have been willing to leave their native <placeName reg="South River, Rockbridge, Virginia" key="tgn,2681713">South</placeName> and join their recreant lords.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>Not long ago a letter was addressed by an officer in the <rs>Federal</rs> navy to his wife in <placeName reg="Portsmouth, Portsmouth, Virginia" key="tgn,7014278">Portsmouth</placeName>, asking her to join him at the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>She promptly replied that her truest and best friends resided in the <rs>South</rs>, and here she chose to remain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>Not satisfied with this, the officer came to <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>, and from there sent another letter, desiring her to pay him a visit at that place, and enclosed her a pass for the purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>This she also refused, very correctly surmising that once in the clutches of the <q>&#x0022;Northern barbarian&#x0022;</q> she would not be able to return. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/> It is reported by those who cross this rubicon, that the treatment they receive at the hands of the <rs>Federal Officers</rs>, if not polite, is at least not positively offensive, contrasting strongly with the course pursued towards passengers by <persName n="Butler,,Bombastes,Furioso,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00232" reg="default:Butler,Bombastes,Furioso,,"><foreName>Bombastes</foreName> <foreName>Furioso</foreName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>To prevent the conveyance of news, both ladies and gentlemen are required to give up all newspapers, (though many surreptitiously find their way through to <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> and <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>,) the ladies being examined by <num value="1">one</num> of their own sex, and the gentlemen by an official appointed for the purpose.
