<head>An Established religion.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> The order of the military commandant of <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> expelling from the pulpits of the churches all clergymen who do not bow the knee to the <rs>Federal Baal</rs>, and requiring that their places shall be supplied by supple tools of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> dynasty, whom the congregations are to be made to support, gives us a slight foretaste of what we have to expect should the <rs>Confederacy</rs> be overrun by its merciless invaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>It is not only our property that is to be taken, it is not only our lives that are to be sacrificed, but when the heart, overburdened with the woes of earth, would turn for hope and consolation to Heaven, it is to be denied that only refuge of poor humanity which never before has the most infamous and accursed of human tyrants denied. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> The pulpits of the <rs>South</rs> have been heretofore occupied by a body of clergymen who would compare favorably in talents, in purity of private life, and in devotion to their sacred calling, with any in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>We speak not of any <num value="1">one</num> denomination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The remark is true of all. There has been as much zeal and as little fanaticism among the <rs>Southern</rs> clergy as among the clergy of any land under the sun. They have never been infected with the <num value="1000">thousand</num> <hi rend="italics">isms</hi> which have swept like a whirlwind over <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, and yet, whilst <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> and the <rs>North</rs> are almost submerged by infidelity, such has been the intelligent devotion of the <rs>Southern</rs> clergy to their duties, and such the influence of their virtuous example, that the number of communicates in the <rs>South</rs> is larger in proportion to the population than that of any other country, and the number even of negroes introduced into the <orgName n="Christian Church" type="church">Christian church</orgName> larger than the whole number of converts in heathen lands made by all the foreign missions of <rs n="Protestant" type="religion">Protestant</rs> Christendom together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>And it is such men who are to be driven from their pulpits and separated from their flocks; who are to be torn from those whom they had taught from infancy the truths of the <rs>Christian</rs> religion; whom they had united in marriage, and the dust of whose kindred they had given to the grave, and who had dried the tears of bereavement and affliction with words of human sympathy and heavenly comfort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>These venerated teachers, counsellors, and friends are to be torn from our embrace, and their places to be supplied by howling abolition dervishes, imported from the hothed of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> fanaticism to bellow forth a religion without either faith or works, a gospel without charity or love, and a morality which recognizes no crime but slavery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> But the <rs>Lord</rs> of Heaven dwelled not alone in temples made by hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>When these temples are converted into Paganshrines, when another Gospel is preached in them than that which more than <measure n="18centuries" type="date">eighteen centuries</measure> have brought down to this generation, we may be compelled to meet for religious worship in woods and caves, but we shall still have access to Him whose presence fills Heaven and earth, and who is a just and righteous <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>If aught were needed to fire our hearts and nerve our arms in this holy struggle for civil and religious liberty, it is found in that crowning act of despotism which has been inaugurated in the churches in <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>, and which is destined to become universal in the <rs>South</rs> as soon as our enemies have succeeded in their plans of conquest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Let us see who will <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> report this lighting the fires of religious persecution; this effort to plant upon the soil of a free country the rack, the thumb screw, and the stake by the sons of those Pilgrims who pretended to come to <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> for &#x0022; freedom to worship <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.&#x0022; If we mistake not the character of the <rs>Confederate</rs> people, if indeed they have any of the feelings common to mankind, this last device of despotism will rouse to superhuman and resistless might the burning heart of the country. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government credit has been maintained by the expedients of borrowing and by issues of paper money, while the premium of gold and exchange have been checked by Government sales of gold.
