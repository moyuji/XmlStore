<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>But a few days ago they all emphatically declared, by sustaining the resolution unanimously adopted, that they had no desire or disposition to interfere with slavery in the <name>States</name> where it exists. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> Yesterday, however, they seemed to have forgotten this declaration, carried away by wild fanaticism, and also the peculiar condition of the country requiring some action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>If they had changed their grounds since the occasion to which he had referred, and were now disposed to invade the sovereignty of the <name>States</name>, then he was no <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> In repeated speeches he had said those who accused the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> of such design uttered a slander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Should they say to the world, when they are about to possess the power of the <rs>Government</rs>, that they are for using it to break down the sovereign rights of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and invade their privileges?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>If that was the doctrine, he could not subscribe to it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>They should bear in mind that they were not the masters, but the more servants of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The proposition to amend the <rs>Constitution</rs> should be taken to their masters, and the latter should be asked whether they will approve or reject it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> He appealed to them for the sake of the peace and quiet of the country, and for the good of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, to come forward to-day, and, with the same unanimity they voted for the resolution to which he had referred, declare the same thing in the pending proposition as an amendment to the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>If you fail to give peace you wrong yourselves and not the people, and on your head will fall the responsibility. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> <persName n="Stanton,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Stanton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName> said that while there were <num value="15">fifteen</num> slaveholding States acknowledging allegiance to the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, and therefore having in their hands the power to protect themselves against an invasion of their rights, it was a matter of little consequence whether such an amendment to the <rs>Constitution</rs> should be inaugurated or not. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> But the state of the country is now essentially and radically changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/><num value="7">Seven</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> States now deny allegiance to the <rs>Government</rs> and have proceeded to organize a separate Confederacy, independent of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Whether it will be recognized or not is a question for the future. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> If these State maintain their position for a year or <num value="2">two</num>, and it should appear that nothing but war or subjugation can bring them back, he would be disposed to recognize their independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>In this state of things, if the remaining slaveholding States remain in the <rs>Union</rs>, they are entitled to additional guarantees.--[Explanation on Democratic side--<q>&#x0022;Good, that is right.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>There are now <num value="7">seven</num> slaveholding and <num value="19">nineteen</num> free States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>In <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> hence <rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs> will, for all practical purposes, be free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>This will make <num value="20">twenty</num> free and <num value="6">six</num> slaveholding States, and in a few years more we will have <num value="5">five</num> more free States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>There would then be the requisite <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> of States to change the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and confer on the <rs>Federal Government</rs> power to interfere with slavery in the <name>States</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> He held that this was a power which should never be invested in Congress, even if there were only <num value="1">one</num> slaveholding State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Slavery was a matter of local and State concern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>If he were a citizen of a slaveholding State, desiring the emancipation of slavery, he would resist interference by the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>If it was the purpose to afford constitutional protection to the slaveholding States, which the altered condition of the country demands, it was incumbent upon them to submit the proposition to the people to say at least how they will recognize it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> It ought not to be said that the <rs>Constitution</rs> which our fathers made is sufficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>At the time of its adoption there was only <num value="1">one</num> free State, all the others slaveholding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Therefore there was no necessity for such guarantee then. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> He was in earnest when he said that he did not desire to interfere with slavery in the <name>States</name>, and apprehended that his associates did not. If the <rs>Border Slave States</rs> remain in the <rs>Union</rs> he apprehended they have the right to demand such guarantees, and, so far as he is concerned, they shall have them.--[Applause from the <rs>Southern</rs> side.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> His friends on the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> side were making a mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>He would tell them that public opinion in the <name>States</name> they represent will not warrant their refusal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>At all events, it was ungenerous to refuse the people an opportunity to express their opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Their position would not be sustained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>He would say to his Southern friends, if this guarantee be now refused, let them forego any act of secession until there shall be an opportunity to appeal to the people of the free States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>[Applause] </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>He had never been able to see any good reason why <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 9" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> should secede at all-much less before the <dateStruct value="-03-4"><day reg="4">4th</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>He did not believe there was any design to coerce <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 9" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>If the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> were to be taken out of the <rs>Union</rs>, it would not prevent the inauguration of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00437" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> as resident of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>Had the rights of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 9" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> become any more insecure since the election than before!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>If so, it was in consequence of the action of members of Congress from the <rs>Southern States</rs>, Their secession had given the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> a majority in Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>The Southern States had the power, and threw it away; and now because they had done wrong, they come and ask us to do wrong also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>He was opposed to hasty action; opposed to <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 9" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> going out at all; but when events might render it necessary, then let her go out peaceably. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>If the framers of the <rs>Constitution</rs> had in tended it to be there, they would have put it there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>If the <name>States</name> had been forced into the <rs>Federal</rs> compact, they might have some excuse; but as it was voluntarily entered into, he believed they had no right to secede from it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/> He was, however, opposed to coercion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>The Constitution gave the <rs>Government</rs> no such power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>If <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> were to be conquered by force, no power could make her send representatives to Congress. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/> Secession he looked upon as a revolutionary measure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>He wanted the matter settled without war. If there were a war, how could the matter be settled after it was over, when treasure had been spent and <num value="1000">thousands</num> of citizens slaughtered?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>[He denied the imputation that he or his people were submissionists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>But if to rally around the flag of the country constituted a submissionist, he was <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>Whenever the time comes when the dignity and honor of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 9" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> requires a fight, he and his people would be counted in. He was for exhausting all fair and honorable means for the settlement of difficulties, before resorting to extreme measures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>People who were in the habit of denouncing the whole <rs>North</rs>, seemed to have forgotten that <num value="1500000">1,500,000</num> votes were cast against <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00439" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> there &mdash; more votes than all the <rs>South</rs> cast against him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/> It might be thought his conservative sentiments were too strong; but he could not forget the past &mdash; he could not forget the struggles of the revolutionary fathers who fought for our liberties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>In the war of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>, some of his own kindred lost their lives under the heroic <rs>Jackson</rs>, fighting for the <rs>Union</rs> which he wanted to preserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>He could not relinquish the attachment that he had formed for the <rs>Union</rs> in his early days. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/> He believed the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> was the best ever formed, and that none could ever be made equal to it. The question was how should the <rs>Union</rs> be reconstructed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>If <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 9" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> went out, she could not be instrumental in this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>He opposed her going out, because he thought it was doubtful about her ever getting back. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/> Why make propositions for the settlement of a difficulty unless you are willing to wait to see whether the result of that proposition would be rejected or acquiesced in? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/> He went on to reply to the proposition of the <rs>Commissioner</rs> from <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, in regard to a standing army to protect the rights of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 9" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>He had heard nothing yet to satisfy him that it was to the interest of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 9" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> to go out of the <rs>Union</rs>, He was pleased that the gentleman from <placeName reg="Bedford, Bedford, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2086267">Bedford</placeName> (<persName n="Goggin,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00440" reg="mostcommon:Goggin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Goggin</surname></persName>) had read from the <rs>Farewell Address</rs> of <persName n="Washington,,George,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00441" reg="default:Washington,George,,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName>, to point out the constitutional remedy for existing evils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>He would, with the leave of the <rs>Convention</rs>, read another extract from his parting advice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>The speaker then </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/> read that portion which counsels a cordial, habitual, immovable attachment to the <rs>Union</rs>, and went on to urge the <rs>Convention</rs> to stand up to the advice of that great man. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/> It was unjust to charge the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> party with the responsibility of the <rs>John Brown</rs> raid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>He did not sympathize with that party, on the contrary he denounced them: but he could not hold them responsible for that invasion as others did. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/> He opposed the proposition that <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 9" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> should go anywhere &mdash; either to the <rs>North</rs> or the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>He cautioned gentlemen that they could make nothing by threats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>It was useless for the <rs>South</rs> to attempt to intimidate the <rs>North</rs> by such a course. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/> Whatever might be the opinions of others, he accepted the proposition of the <orgName n="Peace Conference" type="conference">Peace Conference</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>He hoped <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 9" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> would accept it, and he thought she would.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>He know his own people would accept it, and believed it would be accepted by the people of the other States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>He wanted it to be known exactly where he stood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>He did not know whether Congress would accept the proposition or not. He expected little of a <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>Our guests were officers of the line, who had just returned from <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName>, and were soon going out to the <name>Crimea</name>, and I had to drink champagne with every <num value="1">one</num> of them; and I appeal to the soberest of men &mdash; to you, sir &mdash; whether you could allow a cold, reasonable, heartless, heeltap to remain in your glass when you were drinking to a man who, in a few weeks, was to be shot at in <hi rend="italics">your</hi> quarrel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>And, after all, I was not very far gone; it is true that I sang a song; but I went to bed, unassisted, wound up my watch, and pulled off my boots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>I also remember my last thoughts before going to sleep, which were, that I was glad there was no early parade next morning, but sorry that the room would go round and round, and round and round, like a dry Maelstrom. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/> I had <num value="2">two</num> remarkable dreams that night.--<num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, I eat in a tower in <placeName key="possibilities=25" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Jerusalem</placeName>, which was being battered by the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Romans</rs>, and at each heavy <hi rend="italics">thud, thud</hi> of the ram, I felt the walls tremble and shake, but did not care how soon they fell, for we had been out of water for a month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>Then I was once more a little boy at school, and very thirsty; at a short distance off, I could see the pastry-cook, with <q>&#x0022;Iced Lemonade&#x0022;</q> written in letters of gold upon the window-pane, and, lo!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>a thrice happy youth was draining a goblet thereof with an eagerness which raised my desire for drink to madness; but between the spot where I stood and the coveted draught was a blank wall, and at <num value="15">fifteen</num> paces therefrom stood a row of <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num>-form boys, with tennis balls in their hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>Thump, thump, whack, thump, came those balls about my ears, as, crouched against the wall, I &mdash; I woke, and discovered that some <num value="1">one</num> was knocking, with the regular single punch of a Nasmyth hammer, at the door, and that my mouth and throat were too parched to tell him to come in.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/> Pop! wobble, wobble, fissch!--and the sensations of years were crowded into the time it would have taken to count <num value="5">five</num>; for those few seconds, I was in Paradise, but the sergeant soon dashed me to the earth. </p> <cit><q>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/> Giddy and ill as I was, I had to be on the square in half an hour &mdash; I, who generally take an hour to dress! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/> Our adjutant, who looked after his officers as a cat after her kittens, or the captain of a college-boat after his crew, joined me as I left the barrack gate, and poured advice and encouragement into my ear. He told me that I knew all I had to do, because we had practised it previously, reminding me how we had gone about our own barrack square imaginary guards and visiting fancy sentries; then he explained everything minutely, informed me that I could not make a mistake, it was all so very simple, but damped this encouraging assurance with the reminder, that the general was very particular, and that any blunder of mine would be a disgrace to the regiment; and so we arrived at the parade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>There stood the different guards in a long red line; there were the colors, and the band, and the brigade-major; and there, in the distance, overwatching the proceedings like a grim <persName n="Jupiter,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00619" reg="mostcommon:Jupiter,nomatch:0"><surname>Jupiter</surname></persName>, the awful general, and there, too, were a select body of ladies, nursery-maids, and children, who had turned our thus early to see the show, which was pretty enough to those who were not actors therein, or, who, being such actors, knew their parts, and had not sick headaches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>I fell in, and the band played, and the colors were paraded up and down, and I got on pretty well until we arrived at a part of the performance where the officers had to march right across the square, in slow time, to their respective guards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>Now, I can keep step very well when in the ranks, because I move my legs when the others do, but my bump of time is, or ought to be, a dead-level; and stepping with the band, now that I was all alone, was to me as physically impossible as waltzing had always been, so that, whenever I glanced at the officer of the adjoining guard, I found I was out of step, and changed feet; and as this happened pretty often, my progress became <num value="1">one</num> continuous <hi rend="italics">chasse,</hi> which must have given me an air of dancing across the parade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>But this was not all; my head was in such a whirl that I could not march straight to my front; so that when at last I reached the red line before me, I found that I had somehow edged off to the wrong guard, and the howls of the brigade-major, while I was running ignominiously about trying to find my place, were something frightful to listen to. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/> At last, the trooping was over, and as all the guards marched off, I felt happier; nobody could bully or interfere with me now, for I was in command; and as we tramped through the streets, I felt at least <measure n="2inches" type="distance">two inches</measure> taller, especially on passing a bow-window where <num value="3">three</num> of the loveliest-- </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/> <q>&#x0022;Howl-l-It!&#x0022;</q> roared a voice of thunder, which brought us up as sharp as if an iron wall had suddenly sprung up before us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/> I jumped so that I dropped my sword. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/> When I had picked it up, I discovered that an individual with a red face and grey whiskers, dressed in uniform, with a cocked-hat and a brass scabbard, and mounted on a powerful big-boned horse, was louring at me. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/> <q>&#x0022;Why the orcus did you not carry arms to me, sir-r-r-r? eh?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/> It is impossible to convey any idea of the accent he gave to that &#x0022;eh?&#x0022; I nearly dropped my sword again. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/> <q>&#x0022;I beg your pardon, sir,&#x0022;</q> said I; <q>&#x0022;I did not see&#x0022;--</q> </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/> &#x0022;Then you ought to have seen, sir,&#x0022; he barked, and digging his spurs into his horse, vanished like a flash of lightning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/>Who he was, what his rank, or whence he came, I know not, neither do I care.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>But a glance at the bow-window she wed me that my discomfiture had proved a source of mirth to the occupants thereof, and I felt bitterly towards the individual with the grey whiskers and powerful voice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>As I could not sink into the earth, a course I should certainly have preferred to adopt, there was nothing for it but to march on, and in due time we reached the gates of the <rs>Lockman Dock</rs>, through which we stopped in slow time, with carried arms, the adjutant's directions coming into my head <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num> as I wanted them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>The guardroom was situated on the right, just inside the gates, and the old guard was posted at open order in front of it; I knew that the new guard must be drawn up facing them, so I led my men solemnly on. </p>
