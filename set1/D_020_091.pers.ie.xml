<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/> --From a letter addressed by yourself to <persName n="Dantzler,the Honorable,O.,M.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00132" reg="default:Dantzler,O.,M.,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">the Hon.</roleName> <foreName>O.</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Dantzler</surname></persName> in <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> last, it appears that you have had under consideration a plan which you propose submitting to Congress, providing relief for the cotton planters and subscribers to the <rs>Confederate</rs> loan in the contingency of a continuance of the blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>The intimation thrown out in your letter was received with pleasure by the planters in this section of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and had the happy effect of relieving, to a great extent, the oppressive anxiety which had begun to be felt among them in regard to the disposition of the cotton crop in the event of a continuance of the blockade, and had also the effect of increasing largely the subscriptions to the <rs>Confederate</rs> loan. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/> But Congress having adjourned without making any provisions against these contingencies, and the bulk of the cotton crop being now ready for market, and the time for the payment of taxes rapidly approaching, a painful anxiety is beginning again to be felt among the cotton planters in anticipation of the utter impossibility of paying their taxes, purchasing their ordinary supplies, and of rendering any pecuniary aid to the <rs>Government</rs>, without either the natural or an artificial market for cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>To us, cotton is both food and raiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>Heretofore we have been so unwise as to depend upon it for everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>It is our only pecuniary resource.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>We must convert it into money before we can live at all, for to us it is both bread and meat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>And unless the <rs>Government</rs> provides some measures of relief, either by buying or advancing upon the cotton, the wealthiest planter will feel the oppression as heavily as the poorest, and indeed more so, for he who has several <num value="100">hundred</num> negroes to feed and clothe, and the taxes to pay upon them, will have no more means of doing so than he who has but <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="10">ten</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>Unless we can convert our cotton into money, or some representative currency, every wheel of business will be locked, the energies of the people paralyzed, and they rendered powerless to afford the least pecuniary aid and support to the <rs>Government</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/> The cotton States are in a far worse condition at present than the grain-growing and meat-raising districts of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>; for the latter find in the <rs>Government</rs> a willing and generous purchaser of all the productions of their labor, but the planter is dependent upon foreign markets for the sale of his cotton, and without the interposition of the <rs>Government</rs> in his behalf he will be, of all its citizens, the heaviest sufferer in these times of calamity; and while he is willing to yield a cheerful and loyal obedience to the law forbidding the exportation of cotton during the continuance of the blockade, and is ready to show his faith in the <rs>Government</rs> by taking its bonds and notes in payment for the production of his labor, it is not only right, but it is the <hi rend="italics">duty</hi> of the <rs>Government</rs> to render him every relief consistent with its constitutional powers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/> No Government ever enjoyed the confidence of its citizens so perfectly and universally as the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States of America</placeName>, and never was there a people so willing to lay their property and their lives as a sacrificial offering upon the altars of their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>But if we <hi rend="italics">fail,</hi> <q>&#x0022;we are of all men most miserable.&#x0022;</q> And with such a spirit pervading the hearts of its citizens, the <rs>Government</rs> cannot be unconscious of the fact that whatever relief it may provide for the cotton planter, by purchasing his crop, or advancing upon it, will return to it in the form of taxes and contributions and donations for the support of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>Besides, a purchase upon the part of the <rs>Government</rs> would give to it the absolute control of the cotton crop, thus affording it a fair opportunity of testing the power of cotton to dissipate blockades, open ports, clear the channels of commerce, secure honorable treaties, and assert its dominion as <rs type="role" reg="King">King</rs> of the <rs type="place">Seas</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/> The writer does not feel competent to indicate any <hi rend="italics">specific</hi> plan of action in providing measures of legislative relief, nor is it necessary that he should do so, as the interest of the <orgName n="Treasury Department" type="department">Treasury Department</orgName> is confided to <num value="1">one</num> in whose sound judgment and financial statesmanship the people have a steadfast and unlimited confidence; but he would press upon your consideration the absolute necessity of maturing some plan providing for the inexorable wants of the cotton planter at an early day in the approaching session of Congress, </p> <milestone unit="column" n="5"/>

<p>
