<head>Condition of our army.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> An observant and intelligent informant, who comes direct from our army, says that it is now, without a doubt, in better condition as far as comfort is concerned than it has been for a year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The men are generally comfortably clothed, and receive for rations bacon, beef and flour, the last named article being purchased at <measure n="8dollars" type="currency">$8</measure> per barrel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>They are sadly in want of blankets, however, and suffer a great deal from the cold nights. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> The same gentleman says that the sick and wounded coming down on the <rs>Central</rs> road are much neglected, no water being given the unfortunate men who are crowded into the cars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>On Wednesday a number of negroes were put on the train at <placeName key="tgn,7013585" n="1.000 66" reg="charlottesville, charlottesville, virginia">Charlottesville</placeName>, already crowded with invalids, and the narrow passage between the seats were filled with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>This state of affairs should receive some attention, though we have no doubt the usual song will be sung-- <q>&#x0022;nobody to blame.&#x0022;</q> </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>We much fear that the philanthropical object which these gentlemen have in view will be marked by disappointment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The following is the document: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> Sir &mdash; A number of the members of the <name>Association</name> for the <name>Promotion</name> of Social Science, now assembled in <placeName key="tgn,7007868" n="1.000 1" reg="bruxelles,bruxelles,belgie,europe">Brussels</placeName>, and representing most of the <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> States, venture to address the <rs>President</rs> of that great people in the <orgName n="Western world" type="newspaper">Western World</orgName> <unclear> </unclear> whose progress and prosperity they cannot but feel the deepest interest. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> The melancholy strife which is now raging and devastating so large a portion of the <rs>North</rs> <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> continent has in its origin and progress given irresistible proofs of the energy and excitement with which the opposing sections have contended for the opinions and principles which each has advocated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Now, we fairly doubt the sincerity of both; but it is not the purpose of this friendly communication to wound the susceptibilities of either.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Blood enough has been shed; treasures enough have been poured out; and it is in the hope that the prayer hitherto but too faintly uttered, but which, nevertheless, represents the almost unanimous sentiment of your <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> brethren &mdash; the hope that the prayer for truce &mdash; for peace may find a concurring response in the <orgName n="Western world" type="newspaper">Western world</orgName>, that we venture to breathe it from this side of the <rs>Atlantic</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> We dare not propose to a people so self-supported, <hi rend="italics">so advanced in civilization,</hi> whose feelings, however strongly incited, cannot be uninfluenced by the course of events and the teachings of experience &mdash; we dare not propose any particular <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">modus procedendi</hi></foreign> by which the grave question and difference may be pacifically solved; but if a suspension of hostilities could be obtained as a preliminary measure, time might be given to consider by what instrumentality the present disastrous conflict might be brought to an end. If the will exist &mdash; which we would not for a moment doubt &mdash; the means may be found more practicable than they at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> appear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The whole civilized world would rejoice in so happy a consummation; and if we can in any way contribute towards it, we shall indeed not have appealed in vain to patriots and Christians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>[Here follow the signatures, which are numerous.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> The <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> says that the rebel army has sustained a disastrous defeat in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, but that does nothing but bring the contending armies to an equality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The cause of the <rs>North</rs> is not advanced a single step by their unexpected victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>It says the rebel army retired in good order, and fully maintained its reputation for courage and determination. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> The London Globe, commenting on the battle in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, says: </p> <cit><q rend="inline">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> The <hi rend="italics">Star</hi> thinks that the restoration of the prestige of the <rs>Northern</rs> army will be a sufficient incentive to fill up the ranks with fresh volunteers, and there will be no necessity for drafting. </p> </div3>

<head>The repulse at <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName> &mdash; Incompetence of the commanders.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> The <orgName n="Mobile Advertiser" type="newspaper">Mobile <hi rend="italics">Advertiser</hi></orgName>, of the <num value="10" type="ordinal">10th</num>, has obtained an account of the repulse at <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>, from a Colonel who was wounded in the engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Our forces numbered about <num value="20000">20,000</num> fighting men. The <hi rend="italics">Advertiser</hi> says: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> It now appears that our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, or at least the <rs>General</rs> in command, were terribly deceived, having been lured by the enemy into a trap carefully prepared for them, and made to fight against heavy odds without the hope of any substantial advantage for this waste of blood and life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The movement on <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName> was made from the <rs>West</rs>, the enemy withdrawing his pickets at our approach, destroying camps, strewing the way with knapsacks, guns, clothing, &#x0026;c., until he reached his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line of entrenchments, where he made a resolute stand.--Our men rapidly pursued what they supposed a flying enemy, counting on a bloodless victory, some of the <rs>Generals</rs> even expecting to obtain possession of the town without firing a gun. Their eyes were opened when they saw the serried ranks of the enemy prepared to receive them, and then they knew that a hard and bloody fight was at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/><orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Moore,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Moore,nomatch:0"><surname>Moore</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>, of <orgName n="division"><persName n="Maury,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Maury,nomatch:0"><surname>Maury</surname></persName>'s division</orgName>, lead the advance, and the battle soon raged hot and furiously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The enemy fought well &mdash; better, it is said, than ever before in the <rs>West</rs>--but they could not withstand the furious charges of our gallant men, who steadily gained upon them, driving them from entrenchment to entrenchment until night closed upon the scene. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> The next day the fight was resumed, the enemy meantime having been heavily reinforced, but our troops again pressed forward, gaining the town of <placeName reg="Corinth, Alcorn, Mississippi" key="tgn,7017649">Corinth</placeName>, and the gallant <orgName type="regiment" key="AL42">42d Alabama</orgName> planting its colors within a square of the <rs type="place">Tishomingo Hotel</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>It became evident, however, that the struggle was too unequal to be continued to any advantage by our forces, whose ranks were becoming fearfully thinned and worn down by fatigue and hunger, while the enemy were being continually reinforced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The order was then given to fall back, and our troops withdrew from the field, leaving many of our dead and some of our wounded in the possession of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Meanwhile the <rs>Federal</rs> had thrown a heavy force (estimated at <num value="20000">20,000</num> men) from <placeName reg="Bolivar, Bolivar, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056001">Bolivar</placeName> to the <rs>South</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>, with the design to cut off our retreat and bag our whole army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>These fresh troops were met with unexampled bravery and vigor by our jaded men in the sanguinary engagement of Sunday at <placeName reg="Pocahontas, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057263">Pocahontas</placeName>, which resulted in the discomfiture of the foe, and, thanks to the genius and experience of <persName n="Price,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Price,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Price</surname></persName>, in the escape of our army by an improvised road to a point west of <placeName reg="Ripley, Tippah, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057359">Ripley</placeName>, where they made a stand. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> The battle on Friday is said to have been the hottest and most desperate of all. Soldiers who were in the <rs n="Battle of Shiloh" type="battle">battle of Shiloh</rs> say it was more terrible than that memorable conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The enemy appear to have been thoroughly posted with regard to all our movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>They knew when a given division passed a given point, what was its strength, the direction of its march, how, when, and where the attack was to be made; in short, everything they wished to know, and of course could make all the preparations they desired to meet us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> We have not been able to obtain particulars of the casualties, but the record, we fear, will be sad enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="AL42">Forty-second Alabama</orgName> went into the fight of <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <num value="530">five hundred and thirty</num> strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>On Saturday it mustered about <num value="300">three hundred</num>, and on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time> a staff officer met the <rs>Major</rs>, who had been wounded in the breast, with only <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="10">ten</num> men, who were all, he said, he had been able together of the regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The rest were either killed, wounded, prisoners, or had fallen by the way from weakness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> On Sunday an order was sent to <persName n="Maury,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Maury,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Maury</surname></persName> to make a charge with his division, but this gallant officer was forced to reply that he had scarcely <num value="2">two</num> regiments left for duty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> <orgName n="Senstak's Artillery"><persName n="Senstak,Artillery,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Senstak,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Artillery"></roleName><surname>Senstak</surname></persName>'s artillery</orgName> was badly cut up, being at <num value="1">one</num> time nearly surrounded by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Doudell's (<orgName type="regiment" key="AL35">35th Alabama</orgName>) regiment was also roughly handled, but nobly sustained the reputation of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName> in the unequal strife. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> Such is a brief, but we believe in the main a truthful, narrative of our recent movement towards <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>It is not our purpose here to comment upon the facts related.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>They are too painful to dwell upon, and call loudly for prompt and searching investigation by the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>If it shall be found that our gallant little army has been led into the <q>&#x0022;jaws of death,&#x0022;</q> and thus cut up by the ignorance, stupidity, and mismanagement of commanders, the country will demand that an example be made that shall prove at once an assurance to the people and a warning to incompetent or self sufficient <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>. </p> </q><bibl n="Advertiser"></bibl></cit> </div3>
