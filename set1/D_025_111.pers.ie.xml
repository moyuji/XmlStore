<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>With reference to army matters, he recommends the repeal by Congress of the substitute law, and the employment of negroes as teamsters and in similar capacities in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>He thinks results have demonstrated the wisdom of retaining the state officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>It had enabled him to organize <num value="18000">18,000</num> troops, in response to a call for <num value="8000">8,000</num>, while <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, who had turned over her State officers, had, for want of an organizing force, not raised her quota, and the <rs>Governor</rs> was obliged to convene the <name>Legislature</name> to reorganize the militia. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> He recommends that the pay of officers be increased <num value="0.25">25 per cent.</num>, and that they receive rations, and that the pay of privates be increased to <num value="22">22</num> per month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>He recommends that cotton planting be restricted to <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> of an acre to the hand, and that every energy be directed to the production of food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>By doing this, and exercising the strictest economy, he thinks the supply of food will be ample. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> He proposes that <measure n="500000dollars" type="currency">$500,000</measure> be appropriated to support soldiers' families, and that aid be extended to the counties along the <rs>Tennessee</rs> border, recently overrun. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>All these sums he thinks should be raised by taxation, rather than by the further issue of bonds or treasury notes, as it is a bad policy to create a debt under the present inflated currency to be paid in <rs type="color">gold</rs> or <rs type="color">silver</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> He opposes loaning the credit of the <rs>State</rs> to the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>, or the endorsement of its bonds, as damaging to State credit, and an improper assumption of the duties of the <rs>General Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Prior to leaving, the fugitives were directed to follow the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName> road, which they pursued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Finding this place an unsafe rendezvous, as the rebel troops might return at any moment, the fugitives, under a pretext of returning shortly, left the house and again took to the woods, remaining there over night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>At daybreak they started again on the same road, and walked <placeName><distance reg="1.5miles">one and a half miles</distance> below <placeName reg="Longbridge, Westmoreland, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2469205">Long Bridge</placeName></placeName>, or the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, awaiting an opportunity to fall in with a colored person who could direct them properly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>They intended to avoid this house; but, being in full sight thereof, the owner became conscious of their presence, and gave them a peremptory order to go into the house. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>This answer did not seem to satisfy <persName n="Mattox,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00039" reg="mostcommon:Mattox,nomatch:0"><surname>Mattox</surname></persName>, and he proposed to take them to <placeName reg="Bottom's Bridge">Bottom's Bridge</placeName>, where he said there was a rebel camp, consisting of <num value="5">five</num> companies, in command of a Colonel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>To this proposition the fugitives acquiesced, determining, at the same time, to kill the scoundrel on the way. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> A consultation was held by <persName n="Mattox,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00040" reg="mostcommon:Mattox,nomatch:0"><surname>Mattox</surname></persName> with his wife, who retired from where the officers stood, lasting some minutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>In the meantime the <rs>Major</rs> and <rs>Lieutenant</rs> leisurely surveyed the yard, and made remarks about the crops, &#x0026;c., and altogether assumed a nonchalant air. Finally they asked him whether he was ready to show them to <placeName reg="Bottom's Bridge">Bottom's Bridge</placeName>, to which he answered, &#x0022;that he did not know whether it was worth while.&#x0022; They then stated that they would return to his mother's house and apologize for their non-appearance last evening, and, leaving the house, had proceeded about <num value="100">one hundred</num> rods, when they made for the <rs type="place">Chickahominy swamp</rs>, where they waded through <measure n="5feet" type="distance">five feet</measure> of water for about half a mile, which brought them to <placeName reg="Longbridge, Westmoreland, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2469205">Long Bridge</placeName>, <measure n="200yards" type="distance">two hundred yards</measure> in the ear of <placeName reg="Mattox's house">Mattox's house</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>They went about <measure n="100yards" type="distance">one hundred yards</measure> below, on the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, and were alarmed by hearing the stroke of cars, caused by a boat coming towards them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>Only by lying down and hiding in the bushes they escaped observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Proceeding about <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a mile further, they heard the approach of cavalry, and saw <num value="6">six</num> mounted men coming on a gallop in a straight course, pointing towards them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>The fugitives ran with all haste towards the river, and, plunging in, hid themselves in the brush.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>The cavalry came on, yelling like demons, &#x0022;The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> sons of-bitches are here in the swamp,&#x0022; and at the same time fired their carbines <num value="7">seven</num> times across the river, and came very near hitting them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Submerged in <measure n="4feet" type="distance">four feet</measure> of water, the unfortunate fugitives did not dare to leave their hiding-place, and remained in the swamp for <measure n="7hours" type="date">seven hours</measure>, when they again ventured forth, taking the old stage route on the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, and made for <placeName reg="Jones's Ford">Jones's Ford</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/> This brought them to <placeName><persName n="Pollard,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00041" reg="mostcommon:Pollard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">widow</roleName> <surname>Pollard</surname></persName>'s farm</placeName>, where they begged for shelter over night, and a chance to dry their drenched garments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>The request was refused, the widow saying that she could not afford to feed and shelter soldiers who should be with the army and not running about the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>The plea of great patriotism to the <rs>Southern</rs> cause, however, caused the widow to relent and allow them to remain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>From the conversation at the supper table the <rs>Major</rs> found that he and his-companions were again suspected of being &#x0022;<rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>,&#x0022; from the fact that the <rs type="role" reg="IsFather">son of</rs> the widow asked the <rs>Major</rs> his rank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>The latter replied that he was <persName n="Garrett,Major,J.,W.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00042" reg="default:Garrett,J.,W.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Garrett</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="53NCInfantry">53d North Carolina infantry</orgName>, and that he was on his was to <placeName reg="New Kent Court- House">New Kent Court- House</placeName>, to which place his regiment was <hi rend="italics">en route,</hi> to be stationed for the protection of the inhabitants against <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> raiders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>Although this story evidently satisfied the &#x0022;widow's son,&#x0022; still he wanted to know why he, as <rs type="role2">Major</rs>, had black velvet cuffs, which indicated a surgeon's rank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>This question the <rs>Major</rs> solved by replying that, his cuffs becoming shabby he could not afford a new coat, and black velvet was easier to be had than gray cloth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>At this house the fugitives remained over night, enjoying rest and supper and breakfast, for which they paid <measure n="8dollars" type="currency">$8</measure> rebel scrip, and only fulled suspicion by sheer impudence and lying. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/> The next morning they met a darkey, who informed them that scouts were constantly up and down the road, hunting after <num value="2">two</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> who had escaped from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>She arrived shortly after, and brought some buttermilk and <num value="2">two</num> biscuits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>They walked all night, and at <time value="11oclock">eleven o'clock</time> next day arrived at <placeName reg="Jones's Ford">Jones's Ford</placeName>, which they crossed, and once more struck the <placeName reg="Charles City, Charles City, Virginia" key="tgn,2111055">Charles City</placeName> road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>They encountered a Rebel picket, while scaling a fence, who on seeing them, came to a &#x0022;present,&#x0022; but did not molest them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>The picket rode off, and in an hour and <num value="0.5">a half</num> they fell in with a colored woman, who directed them properly towards the <rs>Union</rs> lines. -- Following the injunction received from this source, a walk of another mile brought the fugitives to a wood on the <name>Diascon</name> <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>, when they again took shelter until nightfall. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/> &#x0022;Happy are they who expect little in this world, for most assuredly they shall not be disappointed.&#x0022; The <num value="6">six</num> rams which were being built at <placeName key="tgn,7008482" n="1.000 3" reg="nantes,loire-atlantique,pays de la loire,france,europe">Nantes</placeName> for the use of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> have been stopped by order of the <rs>Emperor</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>It was hoped that the <rs>French</rs> monarch would manifest some what more of an independent spirit than <persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00221" reg="nearbymention:Russell,Henry,,,"><surname>Russell</surname></persName> has done; but hopes are, beyond everything else, deceitful, as to the objects of this life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/><persName n="Dayton,Minister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00222" reg="mostcommon:Dayton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Minister">Minister</roleName> <surname>Dayton</surname></persName> gave the order and the rams were suppressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>So, at least, says <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00223" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName>, and we suppose it is true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>We must hereafter look only to ourselves and our own interior resources for our protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>It is vain to tell us that the <rs>English</rs> people, or the <rs>French</rs> people, or any other people, are in our favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>If such be the fact, their love is of the coldest and most abstract description which it is possible to conceive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>It consists not in outward symptoms, but is confined to their own bosoms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>They are too bashful to afford the least tangible evidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>It is so abstruse that it would require a mathematician to calculate it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/> The <orgName n="Richmond Enquirer" type="newspaper">Richmond <hi rend="italics">Enquirer</hi></orgName>, some days ago, took the ground that when the <rs>English Consuls</rs> were disowned by our Government the <rs>French Consuls</rs>, and, indeed, all other Consuls, ought to have been placed in the same category.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>It argued that the dismission proceeded from improper motives when it was placed upon the interference of <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> of them in our domestic affairs &mdash; that the true ground was the fact of their having received their <hi rend="italics">exequatur</hi> from the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>--that upon that ground all the foreign Consuls ought to be dismissed &mdash; and that it was making an invidious distinction &mdash; and <num value="1">one</num> which would most assuredly give offence &mdash; to let the whole weight of the punishment fall upon <num value="1">one</num> nation.--We think the <hi rend="italics">Enquirer </hi> was right in this particular; but we are disposed to think, also, that the <rs>Government</rs> made the discrimination from a desire not to interfere with the <rs>French Consuls</rs>, because it was supposed that the <rs>French Government</rs> was favorable to us. We now see that this was a mistake, and we deeply regret that all were not dismissed at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>In that case <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> would have had no right to take offence, and we should have done at a blow what, in all probability, we shall hereafter be compelled to do piece-meal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>We hope the <rs>Executive</rs> will act upon this hint &mdash; assume a new principle of action in the premises &mdash; and dismiss every Consul who has been acknowledged as such by the <rs>Federal Government</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/> We are alone in this war. Would that we could say that the other nations of the earth were even neutral.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>That they all <hi rend="italics">profess</hi> to be so is true enough; but there is not <num value="1">one</num> of them whose neutrality weighs not heavily upon us, while it is altogether in favor of our enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>From <placeName reg="Eire" key="tgn,7001181">Ireland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Germany" key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> the ranks of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> armies are recruited as fast as they are thinned by the fire of our soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>Yet <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> and all the <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> States profess to be strictly and fastidiously neutral.--And so they are, so far as neutrality consists, in cautiously abstaining from the least act which can in the remotest degree be beneficial to us. But with regard to such acts as may be of benefit to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> the case is very different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>The British Government, for instance, knows perfectly well that the tens of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irishmen</rs> who land every month throughout the season in New York are drafted to serve in the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>They know that such is their destination before they leave home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>Now, we are but indifferent lawyers, and it is many years since we have read any work on <name>English</name> law, even of a character so popular as <placeName reg="Blackstone, Nottoway, Virginia" key="tgn,2110692">Blackstone</placeName>'s Commentaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>Yet, if we are not very much mistaken, we remember that in <placeName reg="Blackstone, Nottoway, Virginia" key="tgn,2110692">Blackstone</placeName>'s Commentaries it is laid down that, while the <rs>King</rs> can force no subject to leave the realm &mdash; not even a convict, who can stay and be hung, if he prefers it to <placeName reg="Botany Bay, Greater London, England" key="tgn,1004145">Botany Bay</placeName> &mdash; he may <hi rend="italics">prohibit,</hi> by his writ of <hi rend="italics">no exert,</hi> any number he may please from doing the same thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/><persName n="Russell,Lord,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00224" reg="default:Russell,John,,,"><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName>, if he thought proper, could prevent emigration from <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName> to this country at any moment by a mere Order in Council.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>If the emigrants had resorted to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> instead of to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> he would have done this long ago. So could the <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> powers have done; for they are all absolute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>Instead of doing so they are furnishing recruits in vast quantities to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and because these recruits are not mustered into service in <placeName reg="Germany" key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> and <placeName reg="Eire" key="tgn,7001181">Ireland</placeName> they expect to cheat us with the mean and pitiful pretence that they are neutral.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>To us, we take it, it is a matter of supreme indifference whether they be drilled, armed, and uniformed in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> or here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>The consequences, at least, are all the same to us.--Would it not be more honest, then, in these Governments to proclaim at once their real character of enemies to us and friends to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/> We are, we repeat, alone in this war. The rest of the world is not only not for us, but it is positively against us. There is no port in the world into which our cruisers can conduct and dispose of a prize.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>There is no ship-yard in which we can build a ship.--There is no country from which we can expect a recruit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>If the characteristic cupidity of <name>English</name> manufacturers compel their Government to permit us to buy arms and clothing at their establishments it is because it always entertains a lively hope that they may be captured before they reach our shores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>Engaged in a desperate struggle for our very existence with an enemy <num value="3">three</num> times as numerous as ourselves, and <num value="10">ten</num> times as well provided with all the materials of war, we are cut off from all hope save in our own exertions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>These have proved sufficient thus far, nor is there any prospect of failure in the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>Let us cease to hope anything from abroad, and cut ourselves off still more effectually by ignoring all powers who ignore us, and suffering none such to have their agents here. </p> </div3>
