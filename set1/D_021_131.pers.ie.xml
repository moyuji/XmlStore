<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/> We followed closely, and the road was filled with wagons, some broken down, others with the mules cut suddenly away, and all deserted by their drivers, who had taken fright on the appearance of a few of the enemy's cavalry, and fled in a miniature <placeName key="tgn,7013988" n="1.000 2272" reg="bull run, prince william, virginia">Bull Run</placeName> stampede. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/> The terrific thunder storm of last <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> led many to suppose that military operations on our Lines would be retarded for several days, and particularly with those who were considered to be perfectly <hi rend="italics">au fais</hi> with the topographical nature of the country on which our noble army was stationed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>With a volatile stream and swamp in front, (the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>,) it was thought that an attack was impossible, or at least impracticable either from friend or foe, owing to the flood of rain which fell; but on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> early our scouts reported that, during the previous night, the enemy had conveyed very heavy bodies of men across, or in the swamp, and that their retreat or extrication was almost a matter of impossibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>Towards <time value="9am">nine A.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/> He stilly proceeding down the road indicated, we found it almost impossible to pass, owing to the immense bodies of water lying along the route, together with an unlimited supply of mud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>How regiment after regiment traversed the ground seems even now almost a problem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>Yet, onward, onward passed <orgName n="division"><persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00268" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>'s division</orgName> towards the point of attack; and although everything seemed unusually quiet there was a peculiar stare and rumbling in the woods and on the road, (some <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure>, and in the woods fronting <persName n="Barker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00269" reg="mostcommon:Barker,nomatch:0"><surname>Barker</surname></persName>'s plantation,) which denoted that the enemy were unusually active and anticipated our advance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/> Between <time value="9">9</time> and <time value="10am">10 A.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>Between 11and <time value="12am">12 A.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>Yet, recovering themselves in an instant, they delivered a murderous volley in reply; and with hearty cheers dashed through the woods after their discomfited and frightened foe, driving them helter skelter before them, and making many bite the cold, wet, and muddy ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>Observing the strength of the enemy's line in front, our commander ordered up the <orgName type="regiment" key="NC4">4th North Carolina</orgName>, who, advancing in force, broke through the <orgName type="regiment" key="2MSBattalion">2d Mississippi battalion</orgName>, in their hurried progress, and divided the latter corps in such a manner that, subsequently, their whole force could not be again collected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>Brilliant in conception and execution, the finely drilled North Carolinas flanked the enemy's dense line of skirmishers, and did such sad, havoc by their flanking fire that the enemy precipitately fell back upon their unfinished breastwork in, and commanding the entrance to, the extensive grounds of <placeName><persName n="Barker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00272" reg="mostcommon:Barker,nomatch:0"><surname>Barker</surname></persName>'s farm</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/> Having arrived in open ground, our forces commenced to howl in a fearful manner, terrifying the enemy with their indescribable sounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="NC4">4th North Carolina</orgName>, regardless of consequences, shut their eyes to the chances, and attacked the work in gallant style, being supported by other regiments to the right and left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>They gained their object, but it is said were unable to retain it, for the enemy's large brass howitzers dealt destruction among them, and it is reported they fell back in admirable order, until fresh troops could be brought to bear upon the hordes of Pennsylvanians, who, in <num value="1000">thousands</num>, were pouring vollies upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>At about this time, <time value="1pm">1 P.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/> Our artillery at this juncture came into play, and although the mud baffled human industry, patience, and perseverance, some piece of the <rs>Lynchburg</rs> (we believe <persName n="Latham,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00275" reg="mostcommon:Latham,nomatch:0"><surname>Latham</surname></persName>'s) Battery got into position, at the entrance to <placeName><persName n="Barker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00276" reg="mostcommon:Barker,nomatch:0"><surname>Barker</surname></persName>'s farm</placeName>, and played such havoc that the foe deserted their <num value="4">four</num> large brass howitzers, unable to reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>But as the enemy's whole brigade-camp (tents and all) were yet standing &mdash; as <placeName reg="Barker's house">Barker's house</placeName>, out-houses, &#x0026;c., lay parallel to the road &mdash; and as a very large wood-pile was at right angles with it, the enemy, reinforced, crowded their breastworks, and from all these points kept up such a terrific fire that our men, appearing from the wood and on the road, were cut down as fast as discovered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>Nothing daunted at the immense show and numbers of the foe, notwithstanding our artillery, from the nature of the roads and ground, was incapable of advancing, our infantry appeared upon their flanks, regiment after regiment, drove them from their hiding places, captured their guns, fortifications, and entire camp, with great supplies, and drove the foe <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> beyond their encampment of the morning. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/> The greatest and hottest fire was about <time value="4pm">4 P.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>Having many valuables in camp, and it being well provided with tents, provisions, (including <measure n="100barrels" type="mass">100 bbls.</measure> of whiskey,) they made a terrific effort to retrieve the fortunes of the day, and <persName n="Casey,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00279" reg="mostcommon:Casey,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Casey</surname></persName>, their commander, moved up every available man to support or cover his flying columns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>Heavy firing consequently commenced between <time value="5">5</time> and <time value="6pm">6 P.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>The fighting in this direction was not of long duration, but of great intensity and noise, <persName n="Imboden,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00281" reg="mostcommon:Imboden,nomatch:0"><surname>Imboden</surname></persName>'s (or Oddaway's) field pieces being worked with remarkable precision and celerity, expediting the enemy's retreat within a short time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>The enthusiasm of the men on the left of the <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName> road could not be restrained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>Short after shout rent the air, and it did not even subside when actually engaged themselves late in the evening; for, although not personally with them, we could well mark their successful advance by the dying sounds of their wild shouts in the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>Thus, then, when darkness had fairly set in upon the scene, the enemy's attempt upon our Lines at <num value="2">two</num> points had <sic>disatrously</sic> failed, and the foe driven <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> beyond their original position of the morning, will a total loss of <num value="12">twelve</num> of <num value="15">fifteen</num> guns, <num value="1000">thousands</num> of killed and wounded; and immense stores of every description. </p>
