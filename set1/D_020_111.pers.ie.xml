<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/> Even now it is said that there prevails among certain classes in <placeName key="tgn,7008154" n="1.000 10" reg="lancashire,england,united kingdom,europe">Lancashire</placeName> a wish to see our Government take a more active part in <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>The manufactures are beginning to be indignant that the great staple of the world should be withheld, and all <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> brought into discomfort or actual want, in order that the ambitions States of the <rs>North</rs> should extend their way over a people who have rejected it, and who. according to the canons which <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> writers themselves have laid down, should be allowed to choose their own institutions and work out their own destiny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>As the interest of a people is, so, for the most part, will be their principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>Whatever may have been the feelings of the <rs>Manchester</rs> world on slavery, whatever may have been their opinions on <name>English</name> interference foreign quarrels, they take in this question the part of the cotton growers of <placeName reg="America, Wabash, Indiana" key="tgn,2131960">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>If the <rs>North</rs> does not emancipate the slaves, why should it forbid the transmission of the produce which slavery gives to mankind? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/> No principle is involved in the contest, and no <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs>, they think, may, with a safe conscience, take which side they like.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>Their interests bid them to assist the <rs>South</rs> in getting their cargoes across the <rs>Atlantic</rs>, and, as we keep up a large navy, it will be better employed in raising the blockade of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> and New Orleans than in cruising between Mediterranean ports or lying at anchor at <placeName key="tgn,1011515" n="1.000 1" reg="spithead,hampshire,england,united kingdom,europe">Spithead</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/> To break the blockade of the <rs>Confederate</rs> ports is therefore likely to be the counsel of the extreme party among the manufacturers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>That such a step would be taken by our Government they will, perhaps, hardly venture to hope, but they may think that a loud outcry, producing a chance of a collision between the <num value="2">two</num> countries, may dispose the people of the <rs>Northern States</rs> to come to terms, and put an end to the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/> Thus the <num value="2">two</num> communities which live by cotton &mdash; the growers in the <rs>Southern States</rs> and the manufacturers here &mdash; may be found combined in the same policy &mdash; that is, to enforce the acknowledgment of Southern independence by embroiling <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> with the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>It is beyond a doubt that the <rs>Southern</rs> people have all along counted on such demands being made in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> as those of which we are now speaking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>We should be sorry that any such convictions should gain ground in the <rs>South</rs>, for it is no part of our duty to interfere in this unrighteous quarrel, and we feel sure that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> would rather undergo much suffering than break through the plain rules of international law. Having recognized the <rs>Confederates</rs> as belligerents, we are bound by laws which admit of no doubt or debate to respect the blockade which the <rs>Northern States</rs> have established. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/> This blockade has been duty notified, it has already been acknowledged by our Government, and submitted to by our naval officers on the station.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>To break it in any way would be an act of war against the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and any hostilities which might follow would constitute an unjust war on our part, which, whatever its issue, would stain the reputation of this country, and expose us to the just reproaches of the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> in after times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>Such acts, we feel sure, <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> will not commit, even to save her great manufacture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>Whenever the <name>Northerners</name> have established an effectual blockade, they will be free to keep it up, without interference on our part. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/> But here another consideration arises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>Is the blockade everywhere effectual?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>It certainly is not. As might be expected, when a few frigates and corvettes undertake to seal up <measure n="3000miles" type="distance">three thousand miles</measure> of coast, there is in the great majority of places no blockade at all. Few only of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> vessels are steamers, and these are not of the fastest class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>The consequence is that vessels are running the blockade every day. The Federal authorities are just now in a great passion because a steamer &mdash; the <rs>Bermuda</rs> &mdash; has got into <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> with a large cargo of munitions of war. That such a thing can be done at <num value="1">one</num> of the principal Atlantic ports show how ineffectual must be the general blockade of the coast. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/> We would therefore remind the <rs>Government</rs> of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> that it is only a real blockade that foreign nations are bound to recognize.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>But we must also remind our <placeName key="tgn,7008154" n="1.000 10" reg="lancashire,england,united kingdom,europe">Lancashire</placeName> friends that the event also shows that the cutting off of the cotton supplies is the work of the <rs>South</rs> as much as of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>If ships can get in, they can also get out; and, if the <rs>South</rs> desired to send us cotton, it has not lacked the opportunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>But it seems to be quite true that all cotton exportation has been forbidden by the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> in order that foreign nations may be forced to take a side in the quarrel.--It would ill become <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> to make herself the tool of such machinations. </p> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/> The news of the disaster at <placeName reg="Lexington, Fayette, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013887">Lexington</placeName> has just reached us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>But now, I must tell you what will be the effect of it. Unless the next few days bring over the news of a brilliant and decisive victory gained by the <rs>Federal Government</rs> over the <rs>Confederates</rs>, <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> will certainly at once try to raise the blockade of the <rs>Southern</rs> ports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>I told you she was on the fence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/> Ships of war have already left these ports, sailing westward under sealed orders.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/> <hi rend="italics">Editors Dispatch:</hi>--We have seen with pride and pleasure the frequent reports in your columns of the liberal contributions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>from various parts of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, for the relief of the gallant soldiers of the <orgName type="mil" key="MDRegiment">Maryland Regiment</orgName>, who abandoned their homes and sundered every domestic tie to take part in the great struggle for Constitutional freedom and the deliverance of the <rs>South</rs> from the vandal hordes that now infest and pollute her soft; and, believing that if public attention were directed to a people and a soldiery whose losses, sufferings, and sacrifices have been without a parallel in the annals of modern civilized warfare, we venture to make an appeal in their behalf, and would earnestly and confidently claim for the <rs>Hampton</rs> soldiers the sympathy of the generous and the contributions of the liberal hearted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/> To appreciate fully their distressed condition, it should be known that the entire county of <placeName reg="Elizabeth City county">Elizabeth City</placeName> is either in possession of the enemy, or at leas; is so far disputed territory as to render a residence there unsafe to our friends; that all loyal citizens, people as well as soldiers, had to leave their homes at almost a moment's warning; that owing to the want of sufficient transportation, (travel by water being prevented by the blockade,) many were unable to save even, a particle of their furniture, whilst none were able to save all; that their entire cross of wheat, corn, oats, potatoes, have been almost destroyed or consumed by the enemy; that dwellings have been pillaged, burnt downer otherwise injured; that their horses, cattle, hogs, and negroes, to the number of nearly a <num value="1000">thousand</num>, have bematolon by our quondam <q>&#x0022;brethren&#x0022;</q> (!) the thieving <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>; that aged and peaceable citizens, not found in arms, have been taken from their homes at <time value="12am">midnight</time>, by a brutal soldiery, and incarcerated for weeks at <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>; that helpless woman has not been secure against insult; and you have a scene of ruth and desolation, of villainy and violence, of misery and want, that should <q>&#x0022;stir the fever in the blood of age and make the infant's sinews strong as steel,&#x0022;</q> While it should arose the pity, and melt the obdurate heart even of a miser. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/> Hence, also, it will be readily seen that many once revelling in affluence are now in straitened circumstances, whilst those who enjoyed a competency are deprived of comforts once deemed necessaries, and the <hi rend="italics">poor</hi>(<name n="God" type="God">God</name> shield them!) are in such destitution that, in many instances, they know not where to get a supply of daily bread for wife and children, or a roof to shelter them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>And yet, despite this terrible state of affairs, <placeName reg="Elizabeth City, Pasquotank, North Carolina" key="tgn,2074494">Elizabeth City</placeName>, with a voting population of less than <num value="400">four hundred</num>, has <num value="5">five</num> volunteer companies in the field, besides her entire militia force.--The lower end of War wick and <persName n="York,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00105" reg="mostcommon:York,nomatch:0"><surname>York</surname></persName> have been only inferior to <placeName reg="Elizabeth City, Pasquotank, North Carolina" key="tgn,2074494">Elizabeth City</placeName> in suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>War wick has furnished more than her quota of volunteers, while <persName n="York,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00106" reg="mostcommon:York,nomatch:0"><surname>York</surname></persName> has furnished mainly <num value="4">four</num> companies he <num value="3">three</num> counties thus contributing in all <num value="1">one</num> full regiment, exclusive of <num value="4">four</num> companies of militia. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/> Now, these men have no friends <hi rend="italics">at home</hi> to provide for their suffering families, nor can the counties, in their corporate capacity, aid them, and it is painfully manifest that the loved ones must suffer for the want of the commonest necessaries of life, whilst the soldiers themselves are poorly clad, most of them being without overcoats, and many with only a single blanket to shield them from the winter's cold, which is fast approaching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>True, tender, noble-hearted woman has not been forgetful of the <rs>Hampton</rs> soldiers, and the names of some from <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>, and elsewhere, whose names are not paraded before the public, from a fear of offending heir modesty, will never be forgotten by them while memory lasts; but when it is remembered that <num value="500">five hundred</num> men are without overcoats, the requisite supply of blankets, and in some cases even shoes to their feet, delicate woman and feeble childhood demanding the meagre pittance of a soldier's pay to satisfy the cravings of hunger, it will be seen how utterly inadequate are the voluntary and generous contributions of a few noble women to relieve their wants; and we appeal with confidence to a Virginia public, whose rights and liberties these men are defending on the tented field, or it may be on battle's ensanguined plain, under such tremendous odds; who, having sacrificed everything, save honor, are now exposing life itself in defence of the fireside of those who are remote from the scene of danger, to come forward with liberal hand and in a spirit of patriotism and religion, and aid in relieving these people, who have uncomplainingly borne these hardships for <num value="6">six</num> long months. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/> Most of these men have families, We know <num value="1">one</num> who has a wife and <num value="8">eight</num> children to support, whilst others have aged mothers and dependent sisters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>Shall this appeal be made in vain to <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginians</rs>, and to Southrons?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>No. Forbid it, every sentiment of patriotism, humanity, and religion!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>Cannot our cities and towns take the matter in hand and each contribute a few <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">hundred dollars</measure>, and will not some generous hearted man or woman, in the different counties, emulate the example of those noble females, address themselves to so sacred a work, and persist in their endeavors, till the needed amount is secured? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>The dispatches from <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus, Kentucky</placeName>, give us details of an important action on the west bank of the <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231">Mississippi river</placeName>, opposite that town; where we inflicted upon the enemy another <placeName reg="Leesburg, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2112647">Leesburg</placeName> disaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>Our strength was only about <num value="0.6">sixty per cent.</num> of the enemy, and we would seem to have labored under the disadvantage of crossing the river and landing in the face of a larger force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>Nevertheless, the victory was complete, not only in the utter rout and overthrow of the foe, but in the capture of prisoners, arms, guns, and stores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>The affair at <placeName reg="Belmont, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013377">Belmont</placeName> is doubtless <num value="1">one</num> of the cleverest ones of the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/> We regret that detailed accounts of this engagement have been intercepted by the burning of bridges and the cutting of telegraphic wires in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>We have been energetic and importunate in calling upon our Government to look to its railway and telegraphic communications with <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName> through <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>Our pleading is now vindicated by this vexatious destruction of bridges by disloyal people along the line, or emissaries from <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00113" reg="mostcommon:Johnson,Robert,,,:1"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName> and <persName n="Maynard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00114" reg="mostcommon:Maynard,nomatch:0"><surname>Maynard</surname></persName> in the <rs>Federal</rs> camps in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>The news cast a sort of damper upon the popular feeling here; but we think without sufficient reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/> The monster has floated down the whole length of our seaboard, without daring to attack a single point, until it has reached a portion of the coast where we happen to have an inconsiderable fort or <num value="2">two</num>, some small batteries of guns, and but a feeble land force to protect them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>Of course, our works at such a place were never intended to resist other than small <unclear>mar ding</unclear> parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>It was never expected that they would withstand an immense fleet, which has taxed the resources of the whole <rs>North</rs> to fit it out. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/> By dint of tremendous cannonading and vastly superior weight of metal, the valorous foe have succeeded in silencing a portion of our guns and getting in to the shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>They will doubtless be able, under the protection on of their guns, if their ships can approach near enough to shore, to effect the disembarkation of their land forces, and to present a strong front at that point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>It would be a miracle, indeed, if so prodigious an armament should be thwarted in this effort by such a meagre force as we happened to have at <num value="1">one</num> particular point of an extensive seaboard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>But their landing will after all avail them nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>It will prove but another <placeName key="tgn,3000601" n="1.000 10" reg="cape hatteras, dare, north carolina">Hatteras</placeName> affair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>They have held <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName> and Newports News for <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>, and are no nearer the interior country now than they were at the beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>What will it avail them to get possession of a few acres of ground so far from home, more than the possession of the <rs type="place">Peninsula of Hampton</rs> has done for <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>.
