<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> A letter from <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> gives an interesting description of the mode of conducting the blockade auctions in that city, which the public see advertised in all the newspapers of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> &mdash; After describing the quiet and altered appearance of the city the writer says: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> <address><street n="King street">On King</street></address> and <address><street n="East Bay street">East Bay streets</street></address> at least <num value="4">four</num> <num value=".2">fifths</num> of the stores are closed, and on <address><street n="Meeting street">Meeting street</street></address> the only oasis <num value="1">one</num> seen in the great desert of suspension is at the houses where the plies of goods which so constantly run the blockade are suctioneered off. Here, when an auction is to take place, merchants, professional characters, and men of leisure, all eager for the accumulation of dollars, congregate in vast numbers, and the store-rooms present a scenes of busy life, which contrasts strongly with the remaining portions of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>I have, by dint of extraordinary perseverance, worked my way into <num value="1">one</num> of these densely packed auction rooms, and found the scene presented <num value="1">one</num> of sufficient interest to describe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>A burly man, of about <measure n="540l." type="pounds"><num value="540">540</num> pounds</measure> avoirdupois, mounts a chair and announces that the sale is about to commence, continuing with the remarks that the conditions are <hi rend="italics">cash,</hi> and that no issue of the <name>Hoyer</name> &#x0026; Ludwig Confederate plate will be taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The crier, who possesses a strength of lung of which <persName n="Stentor,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Stentor,nomatch:0"><surname>Stentor</surname></persName> himself would have been proud, and a rapidity of articulation that has never been surpassed by human tongue, is accompanied by a little gray headed man, who wears a woollen cap of richly variegated hues, the crown of which displays the <rs>Confederate</rs> flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>This little mans chief occupation is to exalt the merits of the goods on sale, throw in occasional witticisms, and catch the &#x0022;winks and blinks&#x0022; of bidders which the crier overlooks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>A wink is as good as a nod with the little man, and he bawls it out as lustily as if he were giving an alarm of fire or crying stop their.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The great majority of the crowd who attend these cargo sales are <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> <rs n="Jewish" type="religion">Jews</rs>, and <num value="1">one</num> is as much surprised at their numbers as at their unpronounceable and strangely sounding cognomens, which at the knock down of every article grates harshly upon the ear of a stranger.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> Many of the merchants here complain that although these immense cargoes are sold at their very doors, yet by means of combinations made among buyers from abroad, they are unable to purchase articles sufficient to justify them in keeping open their stores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>For example, <num value="3">three</num>, <num value="4">four</num>, <num value="5">five</num>, or <num value="6">six</num> buyers may combine and purchase a lot of articles amounting in the aggregate to <num value="100000">one hundred thousand</num> or more dollars, and then divide the loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>This is frequently done and, as the auctioneers, who have a most extensive catalogue to dispose of, go upon the principle of condensing all they can, the buyer of more limited purse has no means of replenishing his exhausted stock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The magnitude of these sales is really surprising, and the last <num value="1">one</num> made by <orgName><persName n="Pringle,,R.,A.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="default:Pringle,R.,A.,,"><foreName>R.</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Pringle</surname></persName> &#x0026; Co</orgName>, I understand, footed up over <num value="2000000.5">two millions and a half</num> of dollars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Over a year ago a series of powerful articles were published in book form, entitled &#x0022;Essays and Reviews,&#x0022; in which the accuracy of the historical portions of the Old Testament were severely criticised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The strict constructionists took alarm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Numerous replies appeared, and the authors of &#x0022;Essays and Reviews&#x0022; were called before the <rs type="place">Ecclesiastical Court</rs> to answer the charge of heresy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>To the surprise of many the accused were acquitted and according to the <name>Westminster</name>, the <rs type="place">Court</rs> laid down the principle that &#x0022;the clergy of the <rs type="place">Established Church</rs> are not chilged to maintain every part of the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> as an infallible record of past history, and every word as the sacred utterance of the spirit of God&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> In the midst of the confusion created by this decision has appeared the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> volume of &#x0022;The <rs>Pentateuch</rs> and Book of <persName><foreName>Joshua</foreName></persName> critically examined.&#x0022; by <persName n="Bishop,Reverend,William,Colenso,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="default:Bishop,William,Colenso,,"><roleName n="Reverend">Rev.</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>Colenso</foreName> <surname>Bishop</surname></persName> of Natal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/> When famine destroys life it may do so under <num value="2">two</num> different conditions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Stoppage of all food &mdash; such as that we have read of in the case of the shipwrecked &mdash; bring on in a short time a train of symptoms which quickly end in the most horrible of deaths.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>The other condition is that when food sufficient, of not in abundance gradually becomes diminished in quality, then in quantity, passing to still another stage, where it is not only altogether deficient in quantity, but also in the qualities necessary each day to rebuild nature's waste, and thus provide for the next day's life. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> On this stinting of physical sustenance supervenes mental depression, causing loss of appetite, thus there is indisposition to partake even of that measure of food which, itself insufficient, is still necessary to keep up some existence. </p>

<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head>What She has a right to complain of.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> She has a right to complain that her neutrality has been denounced in the <name>Halls</name> of Congress as either treasonable or cowardly or both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>This is a most unkind return to those patriotic and loyal men, who, perfectly understanding the difficulties in their path, adopted the only line of policy that could stem the tide of Southern sympathy, and in so doing keep safely to her moorings a great State which, if it had been lost to the <rs>Union</rs>, would greatly have weakened the national strength, if it had not, indeed, changed the whole character of the war. But this, perhaps is an ephemeral wrong which eventually may recall upon its perpetrators, and be visited upon them with contemporaneous and historic contempt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/> She has a right to complain, that since the occupancy of her country by the <rs>Federal</rs> troops the rights of property have not been duly respected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>Under the specious plea of &#x0022;military necessity.&#x0022; farms have been laid waste, provisions have been seized, forage has been collected, and, instead of being bought in open market, where the supply would have been ample and the competition fair, commissaries have gone with teams and soldiers, taking grain and other commodities from the farmers at whatever price the commissaries choose to affix to them, and utterly regardless whether the farmers could spare them or not, and, instead of prompt payment, leaving in its stead cumbrous certificates which have to pass through many hands before they are properly audited, and then to pass into the general vortex of Governmental claims &mdash; In consequence of this oppressive and inexcusable, because unnecessary conduct many of our farmers have been deprived of the means of subsisting their own stock during the present winter, and the direct and consequential losses to them have been ruinous in the extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Yet even this might have and has been borne as <num value="1">one</num> of the unpleasant concomitants that follow the marches or encampments of troops; but still it is a matter of wonder to <rs n="Kentuckian" type="group">Kentuckians</rs> why a different rule prevails on the opposite side of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>Why is it that all supplies are bought and paid for in <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, the <rs>Government</rs> coming in as any other purchaser while the same things are unceremoniously seized in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>?--Had <placeName key="tgn,7007255" n="1.000 14" reg="kentucky">Kentucky</placeName> lost any of her equality with other loyal states; and, if not who is responsible for making a disparaging difference with her? </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="2"> 
<head>The State and her laws Controlled by no Abolitionists.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/> Since the commencement of this civil war there has suddenly grown up a theory outside of and above the <rs>Constitution</rs> and a new doctrine has been introduced into practical exhibition &mdash; that <hi rend="italics">military necessity</hi> is not to be measured by <hi rend="italics">constitutional</hi> limits, but must be the judge of the extract of its powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>As an offshoot from this political heresy there have appeared among us not only anti slavery propagandists but men who have actually presumed to override our own State laws and turn regiments brought here ostensibly for our protection into cities of refuge for runaway slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>To such an extent has this been carried that not only have our citizens been driven from the camps where they have traced their property into the possession of soldiers, but the <rs type="role" reg="civil-Officer">civil officers</rs> have been prevented from serving any process for their recovery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>This high-handed and iniquitous conduct is daily and honily weakening the cause of the <rs>Union</rs> and paralyzing the efforts to suppress the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>And in addition to all this it is putting the <rs>State</rs> to imminent peril.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>It is asking too much of the citizen to expect him to fold his arms in quiet submission when his property is taken from him in his very presence, and to be rudely thrust aside at the point of the bayonet when he attempt to reclaim it. Your State laws are already ample for redress of offences against the property of the citizen, as the same have been ordinarily committed; but I suggest to you the propriety of other and more stringent laws against the infamous practice of abolition soldiers in this particular, and to do this effectually there should be a solemn affirmation of the great truth that in all free Governments the military is and must be subject to the civil authority, and by proper legislation give it a practical meaning by providing for its maintenance at all hazards. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/> It is but just to add that this accusation does not apply indiscriminately to all the regiments that have been quartered in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>The commanders of many of them oppose the practice so far as they can do so consistently with what they believe to be their duty as subject to the rules and articles of war and the proclamation of the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, issued on the <date value="09-22">22d of September</date> last. </p> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/> As an operative edict in the <rs>Southern</rs> rebellious States, it can have no other effect than to strengthen them in their rebellion, and give a tolerable pretext to their cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>He might with as much reason have issued a proclamation to them to lay down their arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>Both equally expose him to a contemptuous rejection of his scheme. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/> But he makes a distinction between slavery in the rebel States and slavery in the loyal States, and proposes to the latter compensated emancipation as an equivalent for their surrender of the institution itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>It is probable that this proposition was intended especially for <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>; but how vain is an offer when there is no power to accept it, even if there was a disposition to do so. <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>'s Constitution fixes the institution as part of her settled policy, and the question is a concluded <num value="1">one</num>, only to be re-opened by the call of a Convention and the adoption of a new Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>This could not, owing to the provisions of the instrument be effected until many years have elapsed &mdash; a period before the arrival of which, it is to be hoped, this wretched war will have been brought to a close. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/> But even if there were no constitutional impediment in the way, his proposition would be and ought to be promptly rejected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/><placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> understands her own interests too well to be thankful for gratuitous advice as to the made in which she should manage them; and when she wants the assistance of any outside administration of her affairs, she claims the privilege of originating the suggestion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>I would, therefore suggest the propriety of your passing a resolution, by way of response to the <rs>President</rs>'s proposition, <hi rend="italics">that <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> rejects it;</hi> and at the same time, in behalf of her own unquestioned rights as an independent power in the control of her own State polity protests against any interference with it as <hi rend="italics">unwarranted by the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.</hi> </p> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/> But by far the most alarming aspect in which the proclamation presents itself is its usurpations of the powers of the <rs>Government</rs> upon the specious pretext that the <rs>President</rs> &#x0022;sincerely believes it to be an act of justice, warranted by the <rs>Constitution</rs> upon military necessity.&#x0022; If military necessity is not to be measured by constitutional limits we are no longer a free people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>The sword has become paramount, and the civil authority subordinate.--The monstrous doctrine has already received an indignant rebuke from the people themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>The great States of New York, Ohio, <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indians</rs>, <placeName reg="New Jersey" key="tgn,7007565">New Jersey</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> in their recent elections have put their veto upon it; and later returns indicate that <placeName reg="Connecticut" key="tgn,7007159">Connecticut</placeName> and other paris of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> will soon add their emphatic condemnation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>Indeed, it is apparent that the people are aroused to the sense of the danger that threatens their constitutional liberties, and will, in good time, come to the rescue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>Until that day &mdash; which is unquestionably near at hand &mdash; arrives, it becomes <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> to maintain the position she has hitherto occupied.--Let her not abate <num value="1">one</num> lot or little of her opposition to Succession or Abolition; but let her poise herself upon the great truth that man is capable of self-government, and that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> designs this country for a great a free, and a happy people, and shape her policy to that great and in the meantime the <name>Legislature</name> would do well to follow the example of our <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> fathers, and place upon her records a process against the proclamation and reaffirm the great principles of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> hearty--State and National. </p> </div4> </div3>

<head>Food Raising.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/> The vital importance of increasing the product of food is awakening universal attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>The agricultural energies of the whole country must be devoted to the single work of producing food for man and beast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>Notwithstanding the wide scenes of desolation, destined to remain unproductive during the war, which vast contending armies have left on our soil, and the serious curtailment from other causes of our producing territory, we have still land and labor enough, with the ordinary blessing of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, to supply our wants, provided our authorities do not paralyze agricultural energies by a maximum of prices and arbitrary impressments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>Intelligent correspondents from the <rs>Southwestern</rs> and Valley portions of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> concur in this view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/><num value="1">One</num> of these, in the columns of a contemporary, says: <q>&#x0022;Last fall <num value="1000">thousands</num> of farmers unhitched their teams from the plough when they heard that commissaries were impressing flour below the market price; and that cause, together with the drought, will give us the smallest crop of wheat that has been raised in the <rs type="place">Valley</rs> for <measure n="15years" type="date">fifteen years</measure>. There is now not a bushel of corn for sale in the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>, and I fear that the mistaken policy will prevent the planting of a large crop the ensuing spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>Impressments of grain below the market price lead farmers to raising broom corn, sorghum, tobacco, cotton, clover need, anything and everything but what is needed for the army.&#x0022;</q> This is human nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>We cannot expect to &#x0022;denounce and shackle men as if they were slaves and robbers, and then command them to work for patriotism.&#x0022; We must encourage and stimulate, not crush out the productive energies of the people. </p> </div3>
