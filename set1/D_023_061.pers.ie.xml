<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>In their march of the day from the immediate vicinity of <placeName reg="Fairfax Court-House">Fairfax Court-House</placeName> the enemy of course did their best to harass our rear with an occasional round of shell, which, however, did no damage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Everything was brought hither in good order and condition, the army being in a far better condition to renew the contest of last week, at a moment's warning, than we anticipated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/> Ere they reached this immediate vicinity, we hear, <persName n="McClellan,Major-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00040" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> had, in accordance with the <rs n="General Order" type="misc">general order</rs> of yesterday, issued an order resuming the chief command of the aggregated army (<persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00041" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName>'s and <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00042" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>'s) thus assembled for the defence of the capital. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/> Our belief is that the rebel <rs>Generals</rs> will essay to cross the river in the hope of getting supplies and other assistance through a secession rising in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, and thus be enabled to move on <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> rather than the <rs>Federal</rs> metropolis, which they probably think too well fortified to be attacked.--This is, however, but a surmise, though the contingency has doubtless been abundantly guarded against by the authorities. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/> If it had been designed to make an attack upon the other side of the river, we believe it would have been made this morning, as every passing hour until it might be made, serves materially to lessen the chance of the success of any such movement when essayed. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/> For a year and <num value="0.5">a half</num> the <rs>South</rs> has stood upon the defensive, and contented itself with parrying the blows aimed against it by a gigantic adversary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>Thanks to the protecting hand of Presidency and the unsurpassed heroism of a gallant and devoted people, the rushing tide of invasion has been rolled back, and victory after victory illumined our banners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>But the successive retreats of our enemies have only been the ebb of a tide which has returned as regularly as it has retired, and bade fair to be of everlasting recurrence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>In the meantime, a large portion of our territory has been exposed to the ravages of a brutal foe, and outrages committed upon peaceful and unoffending citizens which would have disagreed the barbarian of the dark ages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>Impunity only added new stimulus to the ferocity of the foe, until the heart of civilization has been sickened by the cruel excesses which they have committed, and from which no age nor sex have escaped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>But the war has now assumed a new phase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>The victories which <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> has vouchsafed our arms have enabled us to assume the aggressive, and the theatre of war is now transferred from <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to the soil of down-trodden <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, where the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> blood in the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> war of independence was spilled, and where a kindred and gallant people have been made to suffer every evil and humiliation which could be inflicted by a foe bloated with triumph and demonize with malice and revenge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>The hour of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>'s deliverance, long deferred, has come at last; the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName> are upon her soil, and a noble people long crushed under the heel of despotism, will soon have the opportunity of rising upon their tyrants and meting out to them with compound interest the just punishment of their crimes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/> With the deliverance of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> will came that of <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>, and our glorious old Commonwealth will soon, we trust, become <q>&#x0022;<num value="1">one</num> and indivisible,&#x0022;</q> in action as in heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>The best of domestic traitors will be summarily routed out, and the gallant mountaineers will rally to the defence of their liberties, and swell the columns of the great army whose banners are now moving forward for the redemption of our whole land, and for righteous retribution upon a merciless and inhuman foe. We have not the shadow of a doubt that <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName> will ere long break the shackles which bind her hands, and that our sister, <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, with the advance of the <orgName n="Army of the West" type="army">Army of the West</orgName>, will shake off her ignominious bondage, and stand proudly erect, <q>&#x0022;redeemed, regenerated and disenthralled&#x0022;</q> When that suspicious hour arrives, let the tyrants tremble!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>They have hitherto known nothing of war but through the blatant editorials of their newspapers and the lying reports of their <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>No roof of them has been fired, no women unsuited, no field desolated, no town and its helpless inhabitants bombarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>They will now be permitted to taste some of the peculiar sweets of the strife and carnage which they have invoked, and whilst we shall not imitate their own violation of the rules of humanity and civilized warfare, we trust that our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> will prove themselves as sagacious thorough, and vigorous, in a war of invasion, as they have already been in a war of defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>In that event, <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00263" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s new levies of <num value="600000">six hundred thousand</num> raw troops will be scattered by our trained veterans like chaff before the whirlwind, and the terms of peace dictated to a haughty and imbecile tyrant upon his own soil. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/> We have no apprehensions that the change from defence to the aggressive will increase the appetite of the <rs>Northern</rs> people for this war. We have already had evidence enough that their own security has stimulated them to increased ferocity and revenge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>They have proved themselves insensible to the distastes of honor justice, and compassion; and men who are <unclear> </unclear> to such influences, can only be operated upon by their fears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>No argument can reach their understanding but bayonets and cannon at their own thresholds, and no defence of the <rs>South</rs> inspire them with respect, but that which throttles them under their own roof trees, and makes them realize in their own persons and property the horrors they have visited upon Southern soil. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/> Now is the time to strike the telling and decisive blows of the war. Our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> are impressed with the fact; our soldiers burn with impatience to retaliate, upon Northern ground, our innumerable wrongs, and to bring this war to a close upon the spot where it commenced, and where alone it, can be ended. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
