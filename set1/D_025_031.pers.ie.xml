<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> At a recent meeting held by citizens of <placeName reg="Halifax, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002166">Halifax county</placeName> an extra session of the <orgName n="Virginia Legislature" type="legislature">Virginia Legislature</orgName> was recommended, and the <rs>Governor</rs> requested to convene <num value="1">one</num> &#x0022;with the least possible delay.&#x0022; <persName n="Coleman,Doctor,E.,A.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="default:Coleman,E.,A.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Coleman</surname></persName> presided, and <persName n="Craddock,Doctor,J.,W.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="default:Craddock,J.,W.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Craddock</surname></persName> acted as <rs type="role2">Secretary</rs>. --The resolution was moved by <persName n="Bruce,Mister,James,C.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="default:Bruce,James,C.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>James</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Bruce</surname></persName>, and adopted unanimously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The chief argument for the calling together the <name>Legislature</name> was that the menaced condition of the <rs>State</rs> demanded measures for the public defence (especially from raids) which it was thought the <name>Legislature</name> should adopt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> The miserable Constitution of '<num value="50">50</num> saddled <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> with biennial sessions of her Legislature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>It was a lame and impotent conclusion for a body of men engaged in so important a matter as amending the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the <rs>State</rs> to arrive at. The <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName>, with her extensive area, large and multiform resources, and constantly accruing subjects of legislative inquiry and action, requires an annual session of her <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>In her condition of peace and security she can not without injury to her interests dispense with it. She had better have a permanent session the year round than a session once in <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>. If ordinarily, however, an annual session is demanded by the wants and interests of the <rs>State</rs>, it is certainly more imperatively called for now, when <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> is threatened by hostile armies and roving banditti, let loose upon her from her Northern border to rob her people and desolate her land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Of course the usual business of legislation is superseded in a great degree by the state of war. The public defence and the safety of the <rs>State</rs> now demand chiefly our deliberation and our means.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>But this deserves the attention of the whole Government, and the measures proper in the exigency cannot receive the highest degree of efficiency without the co-operation of all the departments. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> We are not among those who scoff at the idea of hereditary valor and virtue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>On the contrary, we hold that there is as much in the blood of men as of horses, and that we may judge somewhat of the future of a generation from the antecedents and the achievements of its ancestors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Into the learned ethnological discussions of some philosophers it is not necessary to enter, but of this we are quite sure, that, whether we call them Celts or <rs n="Anglo-Saxon" type="group">Anglo-Saxons</rs>, the people from whom our countrymen have descended have set them an example in defence of their hearths, altars, rights, and independence, which were never expressed in <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName> or Latin story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>It is well for the descendants of a mighty race, when placed in circumstances of great trial and peril, to look back at the conduct of their ancestors when similarly situated, and from that retrospect derive instruction, example, and encouragement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>We propose a brief glance at only <num value="1">one</num> of the many illustrations which the <rs>Past</rs> affords of the temper and prowess of our ancestors when their liberties were seriously menaced &mdash; the familiar instance of the <rs>Spanish Armada</rs> &mdash; and are content to leave it to the deeds of the <rs>South</rs> to prove whether they are descended from that a alwart race, or are a mongrel litter of puppies, who know no more than dogs do of their grandfathers, and deserve to be caught by the dogcatchers, and only rescued from death by a dog-collar, in the shapes of an oath of allegiance to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> Before the age of <persName><foreName>Elizabeth</foreName></persName>, <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> had little more foothold upon the unstable deep than the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> at this hour, although the roots of her present naval supremacy may be traced far back into <placeName key="tgn,1000066" n="1.000 10" reg="Danmark,Europe">Danish</placeName>, and even <persName n="Saxon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Saxon,nomatch:0"><surname>Saxon</surname></persName> times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>It was the general opinion, up to the days of <persName n="Drake,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Drake,nomatch:0"><surname>Drake</surname></persName> and <persName n="Hankins,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Hankins,nomatch:0"><surname>Hankins</surname></persName>, that the <rs>English</rs> navy would never be able to cope with the great armaments of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, or even <placeName key="tgn,1000090" n="1.000 98" reg="portugal">Portugal</placeName>, upon the ocean!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Such was the status of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> among naval powers when <persName n="Drake,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Drake,nomatch:0"><surname>Drake</surname></persName> and <persName n="Hankins,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Hankins,nomatch:0"><surname>Hankins</surname></persName>, like <persName n="Semmes,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Semmes,nomatch:0"><surname>Semmes</surname></persName> and Maflit began to prove that the blood of the old Vikings was still alive in the exploits of their descendants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>It was in the year <dateStruct value="1587--"><year reg="1587">1587</year></dateStruct>, when the magnitude and object of the <rs>Armada</rs> became known, that <persName n="Drake,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Drake,nomatch:0"><surname>Drake</surname></persName>, with only <num value="30">thirty</num> ships, dashed into <placeName reg="Cadiz, Cadiz, Andalucia" key="tgn,7007512">Cadiz</placeName>, where a fleet was waiting to join the <rs>Armada</rs>, and destroyed every vessel--<num value="100">one hundred</num> in all!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The main body of the <rs>Armada</rs> was in the <rs>Tagus</rs>, and <persName n="Drake,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Drake,nomatch:0"><surname>Drake</surname></persName>, with his <num value="30">thirty</num> ships, challenged their commander to come out and meet him, but he prudently declined; whereupon <persName n="Drake,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Drake,nomatch:0"><surname>Drake</surname></persName> returned home, contented with having, as he styles it, &#x0022;singed the <rs>King</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>'s beard.&#x0022; It is not, however, the conduct of this or that man, but of the whole English Government and people, that challenge the admiration and imitation of posterity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The preparations of the <name>Spaniards</name> were, for that day, of the most gigantic character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The Armada consisted of over <num value="200">200</num> ships, some <num value="25000">25,000</num> soldiers, <num value="3450">3,450</num> sailors, <num value="2088">2,088</num> slaves, <num value="2630">2,630</num> pieces of ordnance, and immense naval and military stores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Besides these, the <rs>Prince</rs> of Porma had <num value="30000">30,000</num> picked troops ready to embark in <persName n="Flanders,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Flanders,nomatch:0"><surname>Flanders</surname></persName>, whilst Guise promised to march <num value="12000">12,000</num> men into <placeName key="tgn,7002886" n="1.000 2" reg="normandie,france,europe">Normandy</placeName>, to be transported by the <rs>Armada</rs> to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>To meet the vast naval odds, there were in the <rs>English</rs> navy only <num value="34">thirty-four</num> ships, carrying <num value="6225">6,225</num> men, besides <num value="157">157</num> merchant ships, not <num value="1">one</num> of which reached <num value="200">two hundred</num> tons, and only <num value="16">sixteen</num>, <num value="100">one hundred</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>It had been a vexed question with <placeName reg="Elizabeth City, Pasquotank, North Carolina" key="tgn,2074494">Elizabeth</placeName>'s advisers whether the main defence should be by land or sea.--But though they concluded to trust mainly to the ships, the land rose up in complete defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Never was there more boundless enthusiasm than that plusky <name>English</name> nation displayed in the presence of the overhanging danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The peasant arrayed himself beside the peer, and not only all <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>, but <num value="120000">120,000</num> men besides, armed for the war, and was so completely organized that a force of <num value="20000">20,000</num> could be concentrated in <measure n="48hours" type="date">forty-eight hours</measure> upon any threatened part of the coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The <rs>Queen</rs>, in a letter to the <rs type="role" reg="Lord-Lieutenant">Lord Lieutenant</rs> of <placeName reg="Hampshire" key="tgn,7008139">Hampshire</placeName>, said of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> what is just as true of the <rs>South</rs>. &#x0022;Every man's particular state in the highest degree will be touched (by the invasion) in respect of country, liberty, wives, children, lands, lives, and religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The <rs>Queen</rs> herself appeared among the soldiers, armed in steel, and, mounted on a noble war horse, she made them a speech which raised their enthusiasm to fever heat.-- &#x0022;I know that I have but the body of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart of a King, aye, and of a King of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> too.&#x0022;--And then she sounds a trumpet blast of stirring defiance, which fairly electrified the whole nation.
