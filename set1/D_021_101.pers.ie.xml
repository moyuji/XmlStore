<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/> We believe that there is no species of exhortation so encouraging to men placed in a trying situation as that which points to others who have struggled through similar difficulties, and by dint of energy and resolution, come out victorious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>For the purpose of cheering our citizens in the present crisis &mdash; our soldiers are in need of no such stimulant &mdash; we alluded yesterday to the desperate straits to which <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> was reduced by the victories of <persName n="Hannibal,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00105" reg="mostcommon:Hannibal,nomatch:0"><surname>Hannibal</surname></persName>, the magnanimity with which she encountered them, and the powerful force of will and determination, which enabled her to triumph over them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/> There is a modern example &mdash; an example of the present century &mdash; more striking even than that of <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>, from which the heart of the patriot must draw courage when he contemplates it. An old and proud nation, which but <measure n="2centuries" type="date">two centuries</measure> age had threatened to impose her yoke upon <num value="0.5">one half</num> of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> &mdash; which had enjoyed the glory of giving a new world to mankind &mdash; whose banner had floated over the <rs>Eastern</rs> as well as the <rs>Western</rs> &#x0022;Isles of the <name>Ocean</name>&#x0022; --whose sons had boasted proudly and justly that the sun never set upon her dominions &mdash; had fallen into premature decay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>Her colonies had been torn from her &mdash; her navy had been destroyed &mdash; her docks and arsenals were rotting &mdash; her commerce was gone &mdash; her army had become an undisciplined rabble &mdash; she lay, apparently, helpless, cursed with the fatal gift of beauty, a temptation to the spoiler, without the strength to resist his enterprises Such was <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, when her condition aroused the cupidity of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00106" reg="nearbymention:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, and lured him on to destruction. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/> There is scarcely a record, in all history, of a more terrible invasion than that which swept over <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> in the months of <dateStruct value="1808-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1808-12-"><month reg="12">December</month>, <year reg="1808">1808</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>The whole Spanish army scarcely amounted to <num value="150000">150,000</num> men. They were ill disciplined, ill armed, turbulent, factious even mutinous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>They paid but a very slender obedience to their officers, and these officers were little better than their men. In strict accordance with their prominent national characteristics, they were full of presumption, and constantly spoke of driving the <rs>French</rs> back to <placeName reg="Paris, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2113557">Paris</placeName>, following on their footsteps, and dethroning the <rs>Emperor</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>Against this rabble, <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00107" reg="nearbymention:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> was on the point of letting loose <num value="330000">three hundred and thirty thousand</num> veterans, <num value="80000">eighty thousand</num> cavalry, and nearly a <num value="1000">thousand</num> pieces of artillery, at the very time their arrogance induced them to judge from a pause in the operations that he had become alarmed at the magnitude of the enterprise, and was on the return to <placeName reg="Paris, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2113557">Paris</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>The tornado at last burst upon the devoted <rs>Spaniards</rs> with all its fury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>This enormous army, divided into <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 6">six corps</orgName>, commenced its march simultaneously upon <num value="6">six</num> different routes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/><num value="5">Five</num> of them kept directly forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>A <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> passed diagonally through the country, before the heads of the other columns, to take in the rear and capture all enemies they might engage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>Everywhere, wherever they presented themselves, the half-armed levies of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> were scattered like chaff before the iron legions of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00108" reg="nearbymention:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>. --He passed on to <placeName key="tgn,7010413" n="1.000 2" reg="madrid,madrid,madrid,espana,europe">Madrid</placeName> with the rapidity of a whirlwind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>There was but a single obstacle that presented itself to his arms; but that in the end proved fatal to him. <num value="1">One</num> of his victorious corps pursued the flying enemy to <placeName key="tgn,7008813" n="1.000 1" reg="zaragoza,zaragoza,aragon,espana,europe">Saragossa</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>The citizens had prepared the place for a siege.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>Its thick walls and innumerable convents and churches rendered it as strong as the strongest fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>It is not worth while here to recount the incidents of the wonderful siege which ensued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>The world has them by heart and they will never cease to be remembered while invasion is tolerated by the inscrutable wisdom of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/><placeName key="tgn,7008813" n="1.000 1" reg="zaragoza,zaragoza,aragon,espana,europe">Saragossa</placeName> fell &mdash; fell after <num value="54000">54,000</num> of her people had been immolated upon the altar of patriotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>But her glory died not with her. She was the <name>Thermopylae</name> of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>Her heroic resistance roused the blood of the <name>Spaniards</name>, and taught them to emulate her example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>The army had been defeated, but the people took the matter into their own hands. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/> The uprising of the <rs>Spanish</rs> people at this period &mdash; after all their own armies had been scattered to the winds and that of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> had been chased from the country &mdash; is <num value="1">one</num> of the most memorable, as it is <num value="1">one</num> of the most interesting, incidents of history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>Guerillas immediately sprung up on every mountain.-- Sommatenes were concealed in every thicket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>The <rs>French</rs> generally held the ground on which they were encamped, but not a foot beyond it. Their communications were cut off, their supplies captured, their stragglers murdered, their small parties surprised and put to the sword.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>No quarter was given to the invaders, and the patriots neither expected nor asked it. The whole nation had become an army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>The <rs>French</rs> could turn nowhere without encountering an enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>In this way, through untold miseries, did the <name>Spaniards</name> assert their independence, and with the assistance of the powerful succors sent them from <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, they won it at last. </p>

<head>The situation.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/> There are people who are never so happy as when they look upon the dark side of affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>It is a luxury to them to be discontented, and it becomes in time a necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>They are not content with an April day of alternate showers and sunshine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>To be perfectly blessed, life must be a perpetual equinoctial storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>It must be confessed that, of late, these birds of darkness have had much to solace their taste for gloom, and that the heavens are still overcast with low hanging clouds, which presage a continued storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>We would not deprive those who love to be unhappy of a drop of refreshment that the prospects afford, and yet things are not as bad as they might be, and it will pain them to discover, even better than they were a year ago. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/> What was the situation of the <rs>South</rs> at that time?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>It was literally at the mercy of the enemy, if the enemy had possessed the enterprise to take advantage of his superior power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>At the time of the <rs n="Pawnee" type="nativeamerican">Pawnee</rs> panic in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, this city could have been taken almost without striking a blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>There were not <num value="2000">two thousand</num> men of all arms to protect our capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>If the <rs n="Pawnee" type="nativeamerican">Pawnee</rs> alarm had been a reality, instead of a fiction, and if <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00109" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:2"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> had then sent half-a-dozen gunboats and <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> men up <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>, the city would at once have become his prey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>He could then have advanced his columns without obstruction to every part of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and with the loss of the <rs>State</rs>, the campaign against the <rs>South</rs> could have been carried on with facilities that might have produced the most embarrassing results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>Even at a later period, before the <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">battle of Manassas</rs>, our condition was far more precarious than at the present moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>We had but <num value="1">one</num> army, and that army outnumbered <num value="3">three</num> to <num value="1">one</num> by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>Everything hung upon the fate of that <num value="1">one</num> army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>If we had been defeated at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> would have fallen, and the <rs>South</rs> had no other army upon which to depend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>But <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> interposed in behalf of that little army, and when it was almost borne down by the heavy masses of the foe, brought up at the very nick of time reinforcements whose appearance struck terror to the enemy and caused their overwhelming rout.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>We have confidence in the same protesting hand which defended us then; and, although we have not availed ourselves as we ought of the golden opportunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/><milestone unit="column" n="2"/> then vouchsafed us, our condition is not hopeless, but, in many respects, gives better augury of ultimate success than it did before that battle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/> It is true that, by our own negligence, we have permitted the enemy to raise and discipline large forces; but we are ourselves no longer dependent upon a single army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>The spirit of the <rs>South</rs> has been raised by those very reverses which threatened to overwhelm it. The whole <rs>South</rs> has become a great camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>We have armies and camps of instruction throughout the whole of our borders.--The soul of the <rs>South</rs>, like the &#x00C6;olian harp, gives forth a stronger strain with the increase of the tempest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>Not only has our military efficiency become enhanced, but the determination of the people never to be subdued has become intensified by the rapacity and cruelty of our vindictive foe. The winter, which he confidently looked to as destined to witness the subjugation of the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> States, has passed, and the time is approaching when his armies will find an enemy in the climate more deadly and terrible than any human adversary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>In the meantime, his debt is enormously increasing, being already swelled to over <num value="1000">one thousand</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num>, and is rising higher and higher every day. Well may he make frantic and desperate exertions to retrieve his fortunes; but he will be opposed by a firmness as solid and immovable as the rocks present to the foaming waves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>He will find every step of his progress resisted to the death, and learn, when it is too late to derive any advantage from the lesson, that a people who are determined to be free cannot be conquered. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/> The telegraph may advise you of military results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>I doubt it, however, as every means to taken to prevent news getting out and so successfully, that more little in known of army operations except what comes through Southern papers, which seem to be early and well posted as to our military movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>Indeed the <rs>Confederates</rs> know more of the military affairs of the people of the <rs>North</rs> than they do themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>I have learned through a source that can be relied on, that the <num value="2">two</num> sections of the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> have struck hands and sealed friendship on this bests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>The radicals are to go for gradual emancipation &mdash; compensation for slaves liberated; confliction by judicial sentence &mdash; for the present, in the mean time military operations are to go on.--If the military operations succeed, these constitutional (<unclear> </unclear>) measures are to be made sufficient to the end &mdash; the utter abolishment of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>If the military operations fing or fall, then <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00253" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:2"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> is to proclaim general emancipation as a military necessity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/> The <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> says that the increased transportation required by the advance in the enemy's territory has increased the war expenses to <num value="5000000">five millions</num> per day &mdash; more than the printing machine has the power to supply. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/> The tax bill is an awful affair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>It will raise an enormous amount of money or destroy a vast amount of business--<num value="1">one</num> or the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>It will pass Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>The public debt by the <date value="07-01">1st of July</date> will be <measure n="1500000000dollars" type="currency">$1,500,000,000</measure>. That is the calculation of the <rs type="role" reg="chief-Auditor">chief Auditor</rs> of the <name>Treasury</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>I think it is short of the reality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>The public really know little of the true condition of the finances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>They will find it out hereafter, when they are called upon to pay the interest of the public debt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>The principal no person expects will be paid. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/> As I have seldom failed in my predictions of the future, as I think your readers will bear me witness, I will now make another, that this war will end in a proclamation of the freedom of the slaves, and in the separation of the cotton States from the <rs>Union</rs>; or, in their subjugation, with a change of our constitutional form of government. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>Nothing marks the decline of the <rs>Republic</rs> more than the degeneracy of these bodies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>There is hardly a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class intellect in either; certainly no acknowledged distinguished statesman except <persName n="Crittenden,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00255" reg="mostcommon:Crittenden,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Crittenden</surname></persName>, and his age has placed him on the lowest benches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>She has been sufficiently punished for that ball in the midst of public calamities. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/> Shall I say a word of public corruption?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>The torrent cannot now be stayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>It is overwhelming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>Fortunes on fortunes are being made, and will be made by favorites, and there seems to be no holp for it except in general repudiation.
