<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/> The Northern journalists, who seem to treat the whole of this national convulsion as a grand theatrical exhibition, supply the public with farce as well as tragedy, and exhibit in their motley columns as frequent provocation to laughter as to sorrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>Nothing in their whole range of comic characters exceeds the exquisite drollery of the spectacles almost daily exhibited, in which each of these great editors puts on a cocked hat, buckles, a sword to his warlike loins, and springing actively to the front of creation, gives lectures to all mankind upon the art of war. It matters not that war is a silence as difficult of mastering and requiring as much education and training as any other,. They think they know it better than those who have made it the study of their lives, and proceed to point out to their <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> the proper course for them to pursue; or, if they fail, they set forth the reasons with the utmost assurance and promptness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>The fact that they are ignorant as asses of the subject they presume to discuss does not diminish in the least the vociferousness of their bray.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>It is astonishing that such natural warriors, who know so well what <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> ought to do, have not long since given their country the benefit of their guidance on the field of battle.
