<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>At the expiration of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> such published list embraced some <num value="40">forty</num> or <num value="50">fifty</num> defaulting Sheriffs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>It seemed that since we had been dispensing public charity to defaulting public officers, their defaults are rapidly growing upon us.
