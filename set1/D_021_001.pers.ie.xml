<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> The campaign in the <rs>Western</rs> portion of this State is now, as far as you are concerned, ended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>At its close you can review it with pride and satisfaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>You <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> encountered the enemy <measure n="5months" type="date">five months</measure> since on his unobstructed march into the interior of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>From that time until recalled from the field, you were engaged in perpetual warfare with him. Hard contested battles and skirmishes were matters of almost daily occurrence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Nor is it to be forgotten that laborious and arduous marches by day and by night were necessary, not only as furnishing you the opportunity of fighting there, but of baffling the foe at different points upon the march of invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>And it is a fact which entitle you to the warm congratulations of your General, and to the thanks and gratitude or your country, that, in the most of the trying scenes through which you have passed, you have proved yourselves men and patriots, who, undaunted by superior numbers, have engaged the foe, beaten him in the field, and battled and frustrated him in his plans to surprise you. On all occasions, under all circumstances, your patriotism and courage have never faltered nor forsaken you. With inadequate transportation, often Illy clad, and with less than a full allowance of provisions, no private has ever uttered a complaint to his General.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>This fact was grateful to his feelings; and if your hardships have not been removed or alleviated by him, it has been because of his inability to do so But your exemplary and patriotic conduct has not passed unobserved nor unappreciated by the <rs>Government</rs> in whose cause we are all enlisted.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/> <hi rend="italics">Editors Dispatch:</hi>--In your paper of <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> I find the following in refer once to the <rs n="Battle of Leesburg" type="battle">battle of Leesburg</rs>: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/> <q>&#x0022;The sequel to the <rs n="Battle of Leesburg" type="battle">battle of Leesburg</rs>, which proved so overwhelmingly disastrous to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, proves how fortunate it was <sic>that</sic> that gallant and sagacious patriot, <persName n="Evans,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00218" reg="mostcommon:Evans,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Evans</surname></persName>, determined to defend it against <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> invasion, instead of surrendering it, as it is understood he had previously been ordered to do.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/> No <num value="1">one</num>, of course, will venture to dissent from the compliment so justly bestowed on <persName n="Evans,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00219" reg="mostcommon:Evans,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Evans</surname></persName>; but I regret to see, in the above paragraph, a repetition of the intimation that the <rs n="Battle of Leesburg" type="battle">battle of Leesburg</rs> had been fought in spite of the orders of <persName n="Evans,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00220" reg="mostcommon:Evans,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Evans</surname></persName>'s superior officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>Immediately after the battle a report was circulated in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> to the effect that <persName n="Evans,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00221" reg="mostcommon:Evans,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Evans</surname></persName> was to be court-martialed for disobedience of orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>From <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> the rumor found its way to the army, where it excited no less consternation than astonishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>But the lapse of a few days sufficed to dispel the baseless fabrication, and to prove that it was the work, not of friends of <persName n="Evans,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00222" reg="mostcommon:Evans,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Evans</surname></persName>, but, we must regret to believe, of enemies of <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00223" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>It was, from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, surprising enough that any <num value="1">one</num> could believe that <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00224" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>--a soldier whose fame is due to his triumphs over the enemies of his country &mdash; could have wished to make the heroism of a brother officer the pretext for his ruin, or could have ventured, in this epoch, to emulate the ingratitude of the <rs n="Athenian" type="ethnic">Athenian</rs> populace toward the victors of Arginase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>Nevertheless, an explicit denial of the charge, founded on positive knowledge of the facts, was some time since published in the correspondence of the <orgName n="New Orleans Delta" type="newspaper">New Orleans <hi rend="italics">Delta</hi></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>It is to be regretted that the denial alluded to did not attract your attention at the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>Since it escaped your observation, I will state that the <rs n="Battle of Leesburg" type="battle">battle of Leesburg</rs>, so far from having been fought in opposition to <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00225" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>'s orders, was fought in accordance with his emphatic suggestions, addressed to <persName n="Evans,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00226" reg="mostcommon:Evans,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Evans</surname></persName> some days before the event.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>The action took place on <date value="10-21">the 21st of October.</date> On the <dateStruct value="--17"><day reg="2">17th</day></dateStruct> <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00227" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> wrote to <persName n="Evans,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00228" reg="mostcommon:Evans,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Evans</surname></persName>, reminding him of the extreme importance of his position, telling him by no means to give it up unless compelled to do so by the pressure of overwhelming numbers, and, at all events, to make a <q>&#x0022;desperate stand&#x0022;</q> for the defence of <placeName reg="Leesburg, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2112647">Leesburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>His gratification at the result of the engagement was expressed to those around him in the warmest terms, and was made public in an order of congratulation and approval, addressed to the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 1">First Corps</orgName> of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>I may likewise state that a similar order was addressed to the whole army by <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00229" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>. </p>
