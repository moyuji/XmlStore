<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/> I was but <measure n="19years" type="date">nineteen years</measure> of age when the incident occurred which has thrown a shadow over my life; and, ah me!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>how many and many a weary year has dragged by since then!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>Young, happy, and beloved, I was in those long-departed days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>They said that I was beautiful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>The mirror now reflects a haggard old woman, with ashen lips and face of deadly pallor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>But do not fancy that you are listening to a mere puling lament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>It is not the flight of years that has brought me to be this wreck of my former self; had it been so, I could have borne the loss cheerfully, patiently, as the common lot of all; but it was no natural progress of decay which has robbed me of bloom, of youth, of the hopes and joys that belong to youth, snapped the link that bound my heart to another's, and doomed me to a lone old age. I try to be patient, but my cross has been heavy, and my heart is empty, and weary, and I long for the death that comes so slowly to those who pray to die. I will try and relate, exactly as it happened, the event which blighted my life.--Though it occurred many years ago, there is no fear that I should have forgotten any of the minutest circumstances!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>they were stamped on my brain too clearly and burningly, like the brand of a red-hot iron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>I see them written in the wrinkles of my brow, in the dead whiteness of my hair, which was a glossy brown once, and has known no gradual change from dark to grey, from grey to white, as with those happy ones who were the companions of my girlhood, and whose honored age is soothed by the love of children and grandchildren.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>But I must not envy them.-- I only meant to say that the difficulty of my task has no connection with want of memory &mdash; I remember but too well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>But as I take the pen, my hand trembles, my head swims, the old rushing faintness and Horror comes over me again, and the well-remembered fear is upon me. Yet I will go on. This, briefly, is my story: I was a great heiress, I believe, though I cared little for the fact; but so it was. My father had great possessions, and no son to inherit after him. His <num value="3">three</num> daughters, of whom I was the youngest, were to share the broad acres among them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>I have said, and truly, that I cared little for this circumstance; and, indeed, I was so rich then in health and youth and love, that I felt myself quite indifferent to all else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>The possession of all the treasures of earth could never have made up for what I then had &mdash; and lost, as I am about to relate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>Of course, we girls knew that we were heiresses, but I do not think <persName><foreName>Lucy</foreName></persName> and <persName><foreName>Minnie</foreName></persName> were any the prouder or the happier on that account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>I know I was not. <persName><foreName>Reginald</foreName></persName> did not court me for my money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>Of <hi rend="italics">that</hi> I felt assured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>He proved it, Heaven be praised !when he shrank from my side after the change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>Yes, in all my lonely age, I can still be thank-ful that he did not keep his word, as some would have done; did not clasp at the altar a hand he had learned to loathe and shudder at, because it was full of gold &mdash; much gold ! Atleast, he spared me that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>And I know that I was loved, and the knowledge has kept me from going mad through many a weary day and restless night, when my hot eyeballs had nota tear to shed, and even to weep was luxury denied me. Our house was an old <persName n="Tudor,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00439" reg="mostcommon:Tudor,nomatch:0"><surname>Tudor</surname></persName> mansion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>My father was very particular in keeping the smallest peculiarities of his home unaltered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>Thus the many peaks and gables, the numerous turrets, and the mullioned windows with their quaint lozenge panes set in lead, remained very nearly as they had been <measure n="3centuries" type="date">three centuries</measure> back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>Over and above the quaint melancholy of our dwelling, with the deep woods of its park and the sullen waters of the mere, our neighborhood was thinly peopled and primitive, and the people round us were ignorant, and tenacious of ancient ideas and traditions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>Thus it was a superstitious atmosphere that we children were reared in, and we heard, from our infancy, countless tales of horror, some mere fables doubtless, others legends of dark deeds of the olden times, exaggerated by credulity and the love of the marvellous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>Our mother had died when we were young, and our other parent being, though a kind father, much absorbed in affairs of various kinds, as an active magistrate and landlord, there was no <num value="1">one</num> to check the unwholesome stream of tradition with which our plastic minds were inundated in the company of nurses and servants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/>As years went on, however, the old ghostly tales partially lost their effects, and our undisciplined minds were turned more towards balls, dresses, and partners, and other matters airy and trivial, more welcome to our riper age. It was at a county assembly that <persName><foreName>Reginald</foreName></persName> and I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> met &mdash; met and loved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>Yes, I am sure that he loved me with all his heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>It was not as deep a heart as some, I have thought in my grief and anger; but I never doubted its truth and honesty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/><persName><foreName>Reginald</foreName></persName>'s father and mine approved of our growing attachment; as for myself, I know I was so happy then, that I look back upon those fleeting moments as on some delicious dream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>I now come to the change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>I have lingered on my childish reminiscences, my bright and happy youth, and now I must tell the rest &mdash; the blight and the sorrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>It was <persName n="Christmas,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00440" reg="mostcommon:Christmas,nomatch:0"><surname>Christmas</surname></persName>, always a joyful and a hospitable time in the country, especially in such an old hall as our home, where quaint customs and frolics were much clung to, as part and parcel of the very dwelling itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>The hall was full of guests &mdash; so full, indeed, that there was great difficulty in providing sleeping accommodation for all. Several narrow and dark chambers in the turrets &mdash; mere pigeon- holes, as we irreverently called what had been thought good enough for the stately gentlemen of <placeName reg="Elizabeth City, Pasquotank, North Carolina" key="tgn,2074494">Elizabeth</placeName>'s reign &mdash; were now allotted to bachelor visitors, and after having been empty for a century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>All the spare room in the body and wings of the hall were occupied, of course; and the servants who had been brought down were lodged at the farm and at the keeper's, so great was the demand for space.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>At last the unexpected arrival of an elderly relative, who had been asked months before, but scarcely expected, caused great commotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>My aunts went about wringing their hands distractedly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/><persName n="Speldhurst,Lady,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00441" reg="mostcommon:Speldhurst,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lady">Lady</roleName> <surname>Speldhurst</surname></persName> was a personage of some consequence; she was a distant cousin, and had been for years on cool terms with us all, on account of some fancied affront or slight when she had paid her <hi rend="italics">last</hi> visit, about the time of my christening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>She was <measure n="70years" type="date">seventy years</measure> old; she was infirm, rich, and testy; moreover, she was my godmother, though I had forgotten the fact, but it seems that though I had formed no expectations of a legacy in my favor, my aunts had done so for me. <persName><roleName n="Aunt">Aunt</roleName> <foreName>Margaret</foreName></persName> was especially eloquent on the subject. &#x0022;There isn't a room left,&#x0022; she said;&#x0022;was ever anything so unfortunate!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>We cannot put <persName n="Speldhurst,Lady,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00442" reg="mostcommon:Speldhurst,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lady">Lady</roleName> <surname>Speldhurst</surname></persName> in the turrets, and yet where is she to sleep?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>And <persName n="Rosa,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00443" reg="mostcommon:Rosa,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosa</surname></persName>'s godmother, too!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>poor dear child ! how dreadful ! After all these years of estrangement, and with a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> in the funds, and no comfortable warm room at her own unlimited disposal &mdash; and <persName n="Christmas,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00444" reg="mostcommon:Christmas,nomatch:0"><surname>Christmas</surname></persName>, of all times in the year !&#x0022; What <hi rend="italics">was</hi> to be done?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>My aunts could not resign their own chambers to <persName n="Speldhurst,Lady,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00445" reg="mostcommon:Speldhurst,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lady">Lady</roleName> <surname>Speldhurst</surname></persName>, because they had already given them up to some of the married guests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>My father was the most hospitable of men, but he was rheumatic, gouty, and methodical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>His sisters-in-law dared not propose to shift his quarters, and indeed he would have far sooner dined on prison fare than have been translated to a strange bed. The matter ended in my giving up my room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>I had a strange reluctance to making the offer, which surprised myself.--Was it a boding of evil to come?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>I cannot say. We are strangely and wonderfully made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>It may have been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>At any rate, I do not think it was any selfish unwillingness to make an old and infirm lady comfortable by a trilling sacrifice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>I was perfectly healthy and strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>The weather was not cold for the time of year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>It was a dark, moist <persName n="Yule,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00446" reg="mostcommon:Yule,nomatch:0"><surname>Yule</surname></persName> &mdash; not a snowy <num value="1">one</num>, though snow brooded overhead in the darkling clouds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>I <hi rend="italics">did</hi> make the offer, which became me, I said with a laugh, as the youngest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/>My sisters laughed, too, and made a jest of my evident wish to propitiate my godmother. &#x0022;She is a fairy godmother, <persName n="Rosa,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00447" reg="mostcommon:Rosa,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosa</surname></persName>,&#x0022; said <persName><foreName>Minnie</foreName></persName>; &#x0022;and you know she was affronted at your christening, and went away muttering vengeance.--Here she is coming back to see you; I hope she brings golden gifts with her. &#x0022; I thought little of <persName n="Speldhurst,Lady,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00448" reg="mostcommon:Speldhurst,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lady">Lady</roleName> <surname>Speldhurst</surname></persName> and her possible golden gifts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>I cared nothing for the wonderful fortune in the funds that my aunts whispered and nodded about so mysteriously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>But, since then, I have wondered whether, had I then shown myself peevish or obstinate, had I refused to give up my room for the expected kinswoman, it would not have altered the whole of my life?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>But then <persName><foreName>Lucy</foreName></persName> or <persName><foreName>Minnie</foreName></persName> would have offered in my stead, and been sacrificed &mdash; what do I say?--better that the blow should have fallen as it did, than on those dear ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/>The chamber to which I removed was a dim little triangular room in the western wing, and was only to be reached by traversing the picture-gallery, or by mounting a little flight of stone stairs which led directly up- </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/> wards from the low-browed arch of a door that opened into the garden.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>There was <num value="1">one</num> more room on the same landing-place, and this was a mere receptacle for broken furni- ture, shattered toys, and all the lumber that <hi rend="italics">will</hi> accumulate in a country-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>The room I was to inhabit for a few nights was a tapestry-hung apartment, with faded green curtains of some costly stuff, contrasting oddly with a new carpet and the bright fresh hangings of the bed, which had been hurriedly erected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>The furniture was half old, half new, and on the dressing-table stood a very quaint oval mirror, in a frame of black wood &mdash; unpolished ebony, I think.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>I can remember the very pattern of the carpet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>the number of chairs, the situation of the bed, the figures on the bed, the figures on the tapestry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>Nay, I can recollect not only the color of the dress I wore on that fatal evening, but the arrangement of every scrap of lace and ribbon, of every flower, every jewel, with a memory but too perfect.-- Scarcely had my maid finished spreading out my various articles of attire for the evening (when there was to be a great dinner-party,) when the rumble of a carriage announced that <persName n="Speldhurst,Lady,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00449" reg="mostcommon:Speldhurst,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lady">Lady</roleName> <surname>Speldhurst</surname></persName> had arrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>The short winter's day drew to a close, and a large number of guests were gathered together in the ample drawing-room, around the blaze of the wood fire, after dinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>My father, I recollect, was not with us at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>There were some squires of the old hard-riding, hard-drinking stamp still lingering over their port in the dining-room, and the host, of course, could not leave them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>But the ladies and all the younger gentlemen &mdash; both those who slept under our roof, and those who would have a dozen miles of fog and mire to encounter on their road home &mdash; were all together, Need I say that <persName><foreName>Reginald</foreName></persName> was there?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>He sat near me &mdash; my accepted lover, my plighted future husband.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/>We were to be married in the spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>My sisters were not far off; they, too, had found eyes that sparkled and softened in meeting theirs, had found hearts that beat responsive to their own. And, in their cases, no rude frost nipped the blossom are it became the fruit; there was no canker in their flowerets of young hope, no cloud in their sky. Innocent and loving, they were beloved by men worthy their esteem. </p>
