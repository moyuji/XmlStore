<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>In his statement about the scene of battle, he puts great faith in the stories of his guide, who had been recommended to him as <num value="1">one</num> familiar with the locality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>And this reminds us of a story &mdash; a true <num value="1">one</num>--which should warn sensation-seekers in battle-fields not to believe every thing that guides tell them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>This story is as follows: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> A Confederate General recently met an Irishman who had served gallantly under him in the war. He was seated on the box of a hack, wielding the whip over a pair of horses that had not been over-fed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Hailing him, and interchanging expressions of mutual satisfaction at meeting, the <rs>General</rs> inquired: <q>&#x0022;And how are you getting along, <persName n="Pat,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Pat,nomatch:0"><surname>Pat</surname></persName>?&#x0022;</q> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> <q>&#x0022;Finely, General,&#x0022; said he. </q>&#x0022;I took to this business immediately <sic>afther</sic> the evacuation, and I have made <measure n="20dollars" type="currency">twenty dollars</measure> a day by visiting the battle-fields.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>You know, General, I know nothing about them, yet I take travelers to them, and talk as if I know'd everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>I took a party of Bostonians the other day to the <rs type="place">Sivin Pines</rs>, and showed the hottest part of the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>I saw a pile of bones in the midst of it that belonged to some animal or other, and pointing to them, said: <q>&#x0022;There lay the bones of the vilest rebel Gineral that fell in the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>You think, Gineral, they didn't believe it, and each of them put a piece of the bones in his <rs n="carpet bag" type="product">carpet-bag</rs> to take home wid him?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> Well, to sensation-hunters and writers it matters very little whether they get the truth or not. The fiction is better than fact, if the fiction is the more startling of the <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>So we commend <persName n="Pat,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Pat,nomatch:0"><surname>Pat</surname></persName> to all of this class &mdash; he will be sure to give them capital for a thrilling narrative. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>It is to be hoped he felt better after the operation, and the probability is that he did, for on the very next day he made a tacit confession that the view he had taken of the situation the day before had been wrong, and that the <name>States</name> of the <rs>South</rs> were not territories, but <hi rend="italics">bona fide</hi> States, acting in their capacity as such, and entitled to have such acts recorded as the acts of so many States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>On the latter day, <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Seward,Mister-Secretary,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00186" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister-Secretary">Mr. Secretary</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName></hi> sent in the vote of the <name>States</name> upon the amendment of the <rs>Constitution</rs> which abolishes slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>It was found that <num value="27">twenty-seven</num> States had voted, making the constitutional <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>Among those that had voted, and that were counted in order to make up the constitutional number, were the names of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>Without them there would not have been the required number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>The inclusion of these States among the number of those which had voted for abolition affords a proof that <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00187" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>,</hi> as well as <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Johnson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00188" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Marmaduke,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>,</hi> regards them still as States, acting, as States always do in their transactions with the <rs>General Government</rs>, through their Legislatures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>The formal declaration of Congress that these States were States, could not have settled their status more decidedly than the action &mdash; or rather the failure to act on that occasion &mdash; by Congress did. <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Stevens,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00189" reg="nearbymention:Stevens,Thaddeus,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stevens</surname></persName></hi> had not a word to throw to a dog. His radical comrades were perfectly mum. The action of the <num value="5">five</num> Southern States, deciding the question, was received as fair and legal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>If the radicals now insist that these <num value="5">five</num> States are out of the <rs>Union</rs>, they entirely upset the great constitutional amendment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>It will thus be seen that the <rs>President</rs> has gained a complete victory. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/> In spite of this triumph, however, the radicals will still continue to keep the <rs>Southern</rs> members out of their places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>If left alone, it is evident enough that they will destroy their party utterly before the existence of the present Congress shall have terminated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>Give them rope, and they will inevitably hang themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/> As for their <hi rend="italics">right</hi> to keep Southern members elect from their seats, it is clear to us that they have none.

These are all the qualifications required: and when the privilege is conceded to each House of judging and deciding the qualifications of its own members, nothing more is meant than that it shall decide whether such members have or have not the qualifications required by the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>To give to a <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> the power to establish an arbitrary standard of qualification is what the law never intended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>It would be to give <num value="1">one</num> branch of the <name>Legislature</name> the power to alter the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>No new qualification can be fixed but by amending the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>Both Houses are plainly violating the <rs>Constitution</rs> in enforcing their own will in this respect; but it is all the better.
