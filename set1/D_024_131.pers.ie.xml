<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> The universal <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> is just now slowly recovering from another lunatic attack. &#x0022;The <orgName n="Stars and Stripes" type="newspaper">Stars and Stripes</orgName> are floating over <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>.&#x0022; This was the great and glorious news announced by the <name>Gorilla</name> in person a few days ago. &#x0022;The rebels have been completely beaten at all points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>In <hi rend="italics">a few hours</hi> the <rs>Mississippi</rs> will be open. &#x0022; Such was that renegade Southerner, <persName n="Porter,,D.,D.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="default:Porter,D.,D.,,"><foreName>D.</foreName> <foreName>D.</foreName> <surname>Porter</surname></persName>'s telegram to <persName n="Welles,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Welles,nomatch:0"><surname>Welles</surname></persName>, dated <placeName reg="Haines's Bluff">Haines's Bluff</placeName>, <date value="05-20">May 20th.</date> Hence the staring capitals and the spread-eagle paragraphs which crowded every Northern paper of the <dateStruct value="--25"><day reg="25">25th ult.</day></dateStruct> That our people's confidence in the impregnability of the <rs>Western Gibraltar</rs> should have been somewhat shaken by their positive, circumstantial, and <hi rend="italics">official</hi> announcement of its capture, was hardly to be wondered at, considering the meagre and totally unsatisfactory accounts we had received from our own side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>With all our experience of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> mendacity, as practiced by their rulers, and of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> gullibility, as illustrated in every phase of this war, we were not quite prepared for the brazen effrontery of this, their culminating effort in the <placeName reg="Munchausen">Munchausen</placeName> line.

<head>The pedlars on horseback.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> We had never expected to see the day when the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> would undertake to astonish the world with noble deeds of horsemanship, and least of all, when they should expect to fright the <rs>South</rs> from its propriety by cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Well aware of the fact that whilst the <rs>Southern</rs> child is cradled as it were on horseback, and becomes as familiar with equestrian exercise as the <name>Arab</name> of the desert, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> has no affinities with the horse, but looks up to him naturally and properly as a superior being, we had not conceived it within the limits of even <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> audacity to adopt the horse as an instrument of Southern subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>But, if we had recalled to mind the history of that enterprising people before the era of railroads, we could not have failed to remember that the horse was the identical animal by which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> originally subjugated commercially the <rs>South</rs>, and all other portions of the country not accessible by water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The era of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> pedlar wagons was unknown to the present generation; but of all the raids that the <rs>South</rs> has suffered, or is likely to suffer, none can equal the depletion which she suffered financially from the raids of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> pedlars, who traversed her whole surface, from the <rs>Potomac</rs> to the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs>, and laid every farm house under contribution to their insatiable cupidity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The horse, not mounted, but hitched to a pedlar-wagon; not cavorting and gaily caparisoned, but staid and solemn as his master, was driven by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> of a former generation to every Southern plantation, and never left without carrying off all the loose change of the neighborhood, depositing in lieu thereof <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> clocks and notions generally, of the most worthless and miserable character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The celebrated <rs>Tom Corwin</rs>, at a <placeName reg="Pilgrim Rock">Pilgrim Rock</placeName> festival in <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, after listening to an oration in which the <name>Sons</name> of the <name>Pilgrims</name> were extolled to the <name>Heavens</name> as the pioneers of all the comforts and civilization of the continent, said that, for his part, he never saw a </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> <rs type="role" reg="IsFather">Son of</rs> the <name>Pilgrims</name> till he saw <num value="1">one</num> driving a pedlar cart, and that he did not make his appearance till the region he visited had become thoroughly reclaimed from the savages and had a little surplus cash!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Where the carcase is there the eagles are gathered together, and where the money is, there the pedlar, with an eve keener than the eagle's, discovered their prey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The introduction of railroads only transferred the pedlars from wagons to cars, and never till the present war did they let go their hold of their victims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>They are now betaking themselves to horses again, for the same old object of rascality and plunder, only carried on in a different form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>They are simply coming now as open and acknowledged banditti, whereas they stole from us before under the guise of peaceful traders and friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>We honestly believe that we have less to fear from them now than formerly, for the horse, except meek, gentle, and hitched to a pedlar cart, is not the animal which can be used by a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> with any <sic>probabilty</sic> of military renown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Yet, strange to say, the announcement that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> intend to put a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> men on horseback, and savage the whole <rs>South</rs> with fire and sword, has created as great a sensation as did the gunboats, which at <num value="1">one</num> time were regarded as amphibious monsters, and capable of subjugating the whole <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> We do not desire to underrate the real damage which may be done by extensive cavalry raids, and feel quite sure that whenever they can ascertain beforehand, as they did in the late raid near this city, that they will meet with no resistance, they will pounce down upon us like so many lions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>If, for example, the people of this city should forget the warning of the <name>Stoneman</name> raid and neglect to organize the large number of men here capable of bearing arms, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> would readily ascertain the fact, and come swooping down upon <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, burn the bridges, and perhaps carry off some important prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>A contemporary suggests that they might even rush far to the interior, and that even the inland town of <placeName reg="Danville, Danville, Virginia" key="tgn,7014729">Danville</placeName> &mdash; considered the safest place in the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> &mdash; might be reached by the invading hordes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>When we bear in mind the long procession of pedlar wagons which in days gone by passed through <placeName reg="Danville, Danville, Virginia" key="tgn,7014729">Danville</placeName> on their way to <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, we are not without misgiving that the pedlars on horseback may take the same route with the ancestral pedlars in wagons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>But to be forewarned is, or ought to be, to be forearmed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> horsemen are never coming when the people are prepared for their reception, and in a thickly wooded country it is easy, with a small body of resolute men, to keep off a large body of cavalry, and make their enterprise a disastrous failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>There are, besides, modes of obstructing the progress of cavalry as well as of gunboats, and torpedoes for the land as well as the sea. The country authorities should at once put themselves in communication with our military leaders, and they will doubtless receive some information which will satisfy them that the projected raid of the pedlars on horseback can be made the most ruinous speculation that ever <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> engaged in. But they should not delay their action for a moment, if they wish to save their property and to bag a good many <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The pedlars themselves, if they venture far in the interior, can all be made prisoners, but we have more than enough of such cattle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>What we want is their horses, and every <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> farmer, instead of permitting his own horses to be taken, should make his plans to add to his own stables by the addition of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> horses, the only inhabitants of Yankeedom who are a desirable addition to Southern territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Let it never be forgotten that the horse, except in a pedlar cart, is never to be dreaded by the descendants of the <name>Cavaliers</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>They owe it to their own reputation, not less than their security, and to the wrongs which their fathers suffered at the hands of the pedlars, that every <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> horse engaged in a Southern raid shall be made prisoner, and go to liquidate as far as possible the damages which the country has suffered, from <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to last, from the cheating, thieving, and robbing sons of the <name>Pilgrims</name>. </p> </div3>
