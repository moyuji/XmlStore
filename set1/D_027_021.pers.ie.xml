<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> Yesterday passed unrippled by a rumor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>At <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, also, all was quiet, though there had been some shelling <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, which did no damage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>A letter from our army correspondent shows that all is quiet along the lines: </p> 
<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head>[from our own correspondent.]</head> <opener> <dateline> <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, <dateStruct value="1864-07-21"><month reg="07">July</month> <day reg="21">21</day>, <year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>. </dateline> </opener> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> I have not written you for upwards of a week, simply because I had nothing worth recording.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>There is no change in the situation, the conformation of the lines of the <num value="2">two</num> armies being identically in every respect as they were on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day of this month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The question very naturally arises as to what <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> it doing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>This is more than I can tell you. My impression, however, is that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> is just now without any plan or definite ideas in regard to the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The presence of a &#x0022;Confederate force&#x0022; in front of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> has doubtless, to a large degree, interfered with his original designs, and for the present he is without any definite plan of empaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The impression in unofficial circles is that he is busy with the shovel and the pick with a view of undermining <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, as he was about to do at <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>This, however, is purely speculative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>It is, however, by no means impossible, but on the contrary is quite probable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> <num value="1">One</num> fact, however, is quite well established, and that is, that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> does not mean to &#x0022;give it up so.&#x0022; He has no idea, none the most distant, of abandoning this line until forced to do so by inexorable necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>At present he is busily strengthening his works and mounting new (and some of them very heavy) guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The shelling of the city meantime continues &mdash; sometimes very slightly, and then again with considerable fury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>It is, however, consoling to know that thus far but little comparative damage has been done to life, limb or property. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> The new schedule of prices adopted by the <rs>Virginia Commissioners</rs> is generally &mdash; indeed, I might say universally &mdash; regarded by the army as ruinous to the cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>On all hands there is a demand that it shall be rescinded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>It is not believed that the good people of this State, who have given so many and repeated proofs of patriotism and self-sacrifice, will make necessary a scheme for their own aggrandizement which must result in the utter and entire depreciation and repudiation of the currency of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>High prices swell the volume of the currency, which in the ratio of inflation is the measure of its depreciation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>It is objected to in the army because many first lieutenants find it necessary to keep a servant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Their pay is <measure n="90dollars" type="currency">$90</measure> per month; whilst the east of a ration to feed the servant on is just <measure n="95dollars" type="currency">$95</measure> by the new schedule, or <measure n="4dollars" type="currency">$4</measure> more per month than his pay. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> The news of the removal of <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joe,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> and the appointment of <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName> to the command of the <orgName n="Army of the West" type="army">Western army</orgName> created great surprise and considerable comment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>There is great contrariety of opinion on the question. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> The refreshing shower of <dateStruct><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> refreshed both animal and vegetable life, and made everything wear a new aspect. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> The soldiers are being well fed, and the animals are still getting bountiful supplies of forage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>In a word, the situation in this army never was more hopeful, and I can truly sound the sentinel's &#x0022;All well.&#x0022; X. </p> </div4>

<head>Skirmish on the river.</head>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>On <unclear></unclear>, I am no great admirer of &#x0022;<unclear></unclear> powers that be;&#x0022; but, unlike the &#x0022;military editor&#x0022; aforesaid, I do find some things in the conduct of the <rs>President</rs> to approve of.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Nothing that the <rs>President</rs> or Cabinet can do pleases him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>When the <rs>President</rs> relieved him of command, determined not to <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> be pleased, he found fault with the <rs>President</rs> for his appointment of <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> as his successor. &#x0022;<persName n="Hardee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Hardee,nomatch:0"><surname>Hardee</surname></persName> had been overslaughed.&#x0022; But it turns out that <persName n="Hardee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Hardee,nomatch:0"><surname>Hardee</surname></persName> had already refused to take command of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Whereupon he suggested that there was a proper man not far distant from <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> to whom the command should have been committed, and charged the <rs>President</rs> with being governed by &#x0022;a malignant jealously unparalleled outside of the bottomless pit.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> In these constant changes of position the aforesaid editor violates <num value="1">one</num> of the oldest maxims of the military art: He exposes his rear and flanks to assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>I am surprised that <num value="1">one</num> who acts himself up as a teacher of the art, who aspires to instruct the <rs>President</rs>, and to point out to our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> what is beat to be done and what not to be done, should forget his own precepts and leave his rear unprotected. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> <num value="1">One</num> word more: Can't my friend, the &#x0022;military editor,&#x0022; find less objectionable English in which to express his ideas and sentiments?

<head>The New schedule of prices for wheat.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/> The voice of the press and of the public seems to be unanimous against this schedule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>It does not even satisfy the farmers, although they are to get <measure n="30dollars" type="currency">thirty dollars</measure> a bushel from the <rs>Government</rs> for it.--The farmers cannot but see that the act of placing such a price upon wheat makes the currency in which it is paid worse than nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>They know what a bushel of wheat is, and what it is worth, measured by the standard of labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>They have been, always, in the habit of paying for reapers the current price of <num value="1">one</num> bushel of wheat <hi rend="italics">per diem.</hi> When they are told that in the money they are to receive, a reaper's day's work cannot be fairly paid for with less than <measure n="30dollars" type="currency">thirty dollars</measure>, what opinions will they form of it? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/> It is principally because it undoes all the labor of the last Congress, and degrades the currency, which that Congress took so much pains to improve, that we object to this schedule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>It is framed precisely as though no such laws as those of the last session had ever been passed &mdash; precisely as though we were still under the pressure of <persName n="Memminger,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00269" reg="mostcommon:Memminger,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Memminger</surname></persName>'s paper mill, and liable to a deluge of treasury notes to the tune of hundreds of <num value="1000000">millions</num> every hour of the day. It plays into the hands of speculators, and those interested in depreciating the currency, and it renders utterly nugatory all the laws of the last session, and this too at a time when money is extremely scarce from the enormous amount withdrawn from circulation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/> We learn from a contemporary that the <rs>Governor</rs> of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> is using every exertion to call the attention of the <rs>President</rs> to this state of the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>We trust that he may succeed, and that a meeting of the commissioners may be immediately called to rectify their terrible mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>That they meant well, no body doubts; but they have blundered fearfully, and fearful may be the consequences, unless they be arrested in mid career. </p> </div3>

<head>Northern Peace sentiments.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/> That the mass of the <rs>Northern</rs> people if they could be permitted to vote their secret sentiments, unawed by bayonets, would to-morrow vote for peace on the basis of separation, rather than encounter the possible consequences of an in definite prolongation of this contest, we do not entertain the shadow of a doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>They are sick at heart of the senseless waste of blood and treasure, and beginning to see that the restoration of Southern trade and commerce is not to be obtained by the expenditure of any amount of gunpowder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>Mini bullets and bombshells, they are fast discovering, are not the kind of currency which produces cotton and tobacco.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>But the latent peace sentiments of the <rs>North</rs> can be of no practical avail to the <rs>Confederate</rs> cause till Confederate bayonets overthrow the armies which sustain the <rs>Lincoln</rs> despotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>We are fighting the battles of freedom in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, as well as in our own country; and though we feel no anxiety to aid in the emancipation of those who have sought to enslave ourselves, yet, if their deliverance will hasten the termination of this war, our labors will not be without reward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>We look to our armies as the only pacificators whose intervention will have any influence in the quarrel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>We look to the camp as the only ark for the <rs>Dove</rs> of Peace, and to the storm and deluge of the battle as the only spot where it can find an olive branch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>Such reflections should inspire the hearts and nerve the arms of every soldier of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>Literally and truly, the only earthly hope of peace is in their success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>Let every General and every private realize this truth in all its bearings, and who can doubt the result? </p> </div3>

<head>Guerillas.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/> A Fincastle paper pertinently calls attention to certain facts which show that small bodies of the rural population, stationed in the forests and narrow passes in the mountains, can inflict serious injury and cause great alarm among raiding parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>Nothing has surprised us more than the neglect of the resident people to interpose such obstacles to the progress of raiders, and, we have no doubt, it has been an equal, but more agreeable, surprise to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>They never could have advanced far into our territory, or done much damage by raiding, if they had been ambushed by a few hardy riflemen in the thick forests and mountain passes of the country. </p> </div3>
