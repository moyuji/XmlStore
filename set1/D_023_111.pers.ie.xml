<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> We have very little later intelligence of operations in <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Northern</rs> Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>So far as we are informed, indications seem to justify the conclusion that an advance of the enemy is contemplated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>It is said that the corps of the <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> <persName n="Sigel,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Sigel,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sigel</surname></persName> crossed the <placeName reg="Rappahannock, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1129010">Rappahannock river</placeName> on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> last.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> We have intelligence of a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> raid upon the town of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>. <persName n="Mullen,Mister,R.,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="default:Mullen,R.,H.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Mullen</surname></persName>, who left the town after our own troops had retired, and while the enemy were still in possession, has furnished as with the following account of the raid. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> About <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time> <time>yesterday</time> morning the enemy's cavalry, supposed to number some <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="400">four hundred</num>, crossed the river at <placeName reg="Falmouth, Stafford, Virginia" key="tgn,2111731">Falmouth</placeName>, and dashed into the town, through Commerce, Main, and <persName><roleName n="Princess">Princess</roleName> <foreName>Anne</foreName></persName> streets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Our forces in the town consisted of <num value="4">four</num> companies of cavalry, under <persName n="Critcher,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Critcher,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/><persName n="Critcher,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Critcher,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Critcher</surname></persName>, with his force, was quartered at the hospital building, near the railroad depot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The enemy seemed to be fully aware of his position, and at once charged his camp, capturing about <num value="25">twenty-five</num> or <num value="30">thirty</num> of his men. The remainder of his force made their escape, and afterwards formed on the outskirts of the town, where a fight ensued, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> attacking them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Meantime the <num value="2">two</num> companies of the <rs>Chesapeake</rs> cavalry, under <persName n="Corbin,Lieutenant,Welford,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="default:Corbin,Welford,,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut.</roleName> <foreName>Welford</foreName> <surname>Corbin</surname></persName>, made a dash upon the guard who had <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs> C.'s men in charge, and succeeded in releasing nearly all of them, besides capturing a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <rs type="role2">Captain</rs> and <num value="3">three</num> privates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>In these <num value="2">two</num> skirmishes Mr. M. thinks we had <num value="2">two</num> men killed and <num value="1">one</num> or <measure n="2" type="wounded">two wounded</measure>. The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="7" type="killed">seven killed</measure> and as many wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> captured state that their force in the neighborhood consisted of an Ohio and an Indiana regiment of cavalry, in all numbering about <num value="1480">1,480</num> men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> It will be perceived by the dispatch of the <rs>Associated Press</rs>, received at <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time> last night, that the town has been evacuated by the enemy, and that the statement of numbers does not by any means correspond with these given by our informant. </p> </div3>

<head>The enemy in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> North Carolina</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>There is so longer any doubt that the enemy's forces in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> North Carolina</placeName> are moving on <placeName reg="Weldon, Halifax, North Carolina" key="tgn,2077124">Weldon</placeName>, with a view of tapping the railroad at that point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>We published some days ago an account of a fight which took place between <num value="3">three</num> companies of the <orgName type="regiment" key="28NCRegiment">28th North Carolina regiment</orgName> and the advance guard of the enemy, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>In this engagement the enemy was repulsed, our lose being <measure n="10" type="killed">ten killed</measure> and <measure n="29" type="wounded">twenty-nine wounded</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> Later intelligence furnishes us with some fuller particulars of the advance, from which it appears that the enemy landed large forces at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, and advanced towards <persName n="Hamilton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Hamilton,Hugh,,,:1"><surname>Hamilton</surname></persName> and took possession of that town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>It is reported that they destroyed nearly the entire place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Their force at <placeName reg="Hamilton, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2112085">Hamilton</placeName> is represented to be about <num value="10000">10,000</num> infantry, with <num value="40">forty</num> pieces of artillery, and a considerable force of cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>They are also reported to have landed a large force at <placeName reg="Palmyra, Halifax, North Carolina" key="tgn,2076015">Palmyra, Halifax co.</placeName>, some <num value="25">twenty-five</num> or <placeName><distance reg="30miles">thirty miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Weldon, Halifax, North Carolina" key="tgn,2077124">Weldon</placeName></placeName>.--<persName n="Pettigrew,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Pettigrew,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Pettigrew</surname></persName> commands the <rs>Confederate</rs> force at <placeName reg="Weldon, Halifax, North Carolina" key="tgn,2077124">Weldon</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are said to be commanded by <persName n="Foster,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Foster,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Foster</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>There was a report in circulation on Saturday that an engagement occurred in the vicinity of <placeName reg="Tarboro, Edgecombe, North Carolina" key="tgn,2076878">Tarboro', Edgecombe county</placeName>, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> last, between some <num value="6">six</num> regiments of N.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The Raleigh <hi rend="italics">Journal,</hi> of <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, says that this report was incorrect, and that nothing of the kind had taken place since the fight of <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The impression prevails that the enemy is concentrating his forces in the neighborhood of <placeName reg="Williamston, Martin, North Carolina" key="tgn,2077225">Williamston, Martin county</placeName>, with the intention of attacking some point on the line of the <orgName n="Wilmington and Weldon Railroad" type="railroad">Wilmington and Weldon Railroad</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> A dispatch from <placeName key="tgn,7014076" n="1.000 108" reg="goldsboro, wayne, north carolina">Goldsboro</placeName>', dated <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time> <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, states that there had been no fighting, and that the enemy had retreated in the direction of <placeName reg="Weldon, Halifax, North Carolina" key="tgn,2077124">Weldon</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>We do not exactly understand now they could have retreated towards <placeName reg="Weldon, Halifax, North Carolina" key="tgn,2077124">Weldon</placeName>, since that is the point towards which they were supposed to be advancing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> A letter in the <orgName n="Petersburg Express" type="newspaper">Petersburg <hi rend="italics">Express</hi></orgName>, from <placeName reg="Tarboro, Edgecombe, North Carolina" key="tgn,2076878">Tarboro</placeName>', dated the <num value="8" type="ordinal">8th</num>, says the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army is marching upon that town with <num value="12000">12,000</num> troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The information is derived from a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> deserter.--They are represented to be within <measure n="15miles" type="distance">fifteen miles</measure> of the town, and within <placeName><distance reg="4miles">four miles</distance> of the <rs>Confederate</rs></placeName> troops. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="3">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>That the <rs>General</rs> had every reason to be satisfied with the arrangement, will appear from the following statement: </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>He instantly informed the <rs>President</rs> of the fact, and reinforcements, provisions, and military stores were dispatched by the <rs>Brooklyn</rs> to <placeName key="tgn,7021610" n="1.000 43" reg="fort pickens, santa rosa island, santa rosa, florida">Fort Pickens</placeName> without a moment's un- <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> necessary delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/> Well-founded apprehensions were, however, entertained at the time of her departure that the reinforcements, with the vessels of war at no great distance from <placeName key="tgn,7021610" n="1.000 43" reg="fort pickens, santa rosa island, santa rosa, florida">Fort Pickens</placeName>, could not arrive in time to defend it against the impending attack.--In this state of suspense, and whilst <persName n="Slemmer,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00059" reg="mostcommon:Slemmer,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Slemmer</surname></persName> was in extreme peril, <persName n="Sildell,Senator,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00060" reg="mostcommon:Sildell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Senator">Senators</roleName> <surname>Sildell</surname></persName>, <persName n="Hunter,Senator,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00061" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Senator"></roleName><surname>Hunter</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Bigler,Senator,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00062" reg="mostcommon:Bigler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Senator"></roleName><surname>Bigler</surname></persName> received a telegraphic dispatch from <persName n="Mallory,Senator,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00063" reg="mostcommon:Mallory,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Mallory</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, dated at <placeName reg="Pensacola, Escambia, Florida" key="tgn,7013972">Pensacola</placeName>, <date value="01-28"> on the 28th January,</date> with the urgent request that they should lay it before the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>This important information satisfied the <rs>Government</rs> that there was no present necessity for sending reinforcements, and that when sent they should go, not in a vessel of commerce, but of war.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/> <date value="01-04">On the 4th of January,</date> the day before the departure of the <orgName n="Star of the West" type="newspaper">Star of the West</orgName> from New York, as <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00088" reg="mostcommon:Scott,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> in his statement admits, succor was sent to <placeName key="tgn,7021537" n="1.000 4" reg="key west, florida keys, monroe, florida">Fort Taylor</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7021537" n="1.000 56" reg="key west, florida keys, monroe, florida">Key West</placeName>, and to <placeName reg="Fort Jefferson, Monroe, Florida" key="tgn,2335347">Fort Jefferson</placeName>, <placeName reg="Tortugas Island">Tortugas Island</placeName>, which reached these points in time for their security.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/> I shall next advert to the statement that the expedition under <persName n="Ward,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00089" reg="mostcommon:Ward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Ward</surname></persName>, <q>&#x0022;of <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> small steamers belonging to the <orgName n="Coast Survey" type="military">coast survey</orgName>,&#x0022;</q> was kept back by something like a truce or armistice, [made here,] embracing <placeName reg="Charleston Harbor, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2233245">Charleston</placeName> and <placeName reg="Pensacola harbor">Pensacola harbors</placeName>, agreed upon between the <rs>President</rs> and certain principal seceders of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, &#x0026;c.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>It was then, with some astonishment that I learned from the statement of the <rs>General</rs> that he had, <date value="1861-03-12">on the 12th of March, 1861,</date> advised that <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00092" reg="nearbymention:Anderson,Joseph,R.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>, should be instructed to evacuate the fort as soon as suitable transportations could be procured to carry himself and his command to New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>A military necessity for a capitulation may have existed in case there should be an attack upon the fort, or a demand for its sur- <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> render, but surely none such could have existed for its voluntary surrender and abandonment. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>Both events occurred about the same time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/> Thus a truce, or suspension of arms, was concluded between the parties, to continues until the question of the surrender of the fort should be decided by the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>This was what writers on public law denominate <q>&#x0022;a partial truce under which hostilities are suspended only in certain places, as between a town and the army besieging it.&#x0022;</q> </p>

<head>The Elections in Yankeedom.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/> As it seems to be incontestable that the <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs> absent from home in the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> armies are in the proportion of at least <num value="4">four</num> to <num value="1">one</num> to the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs>, the victory which the <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs> have just won at the polls is the most astounding on record.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>What does it signify? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/> In our humble judgment it means this, and nothing more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>The <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs> have a vast deal more sense than the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs>, and cannot fail to see how completely the latter have succeeded in destroying the prosperity of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>They always opposed the suicidal folly of that faction &mdash; their continual aggressions upon the <rs>South</rs>, and their systematic efforts to make the <hi rend="italics">nigger</hi> the only question in the <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>They opposed this pulley because they could not but foresees that it would lead to the destruction of the <rs>Union</rs>, and all the material interests which, so far as the <rs>North</rs> was concerned, they felt be bound up in it. The <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> afford, indeed, the most astonishing example of men quarrelling with their own bread and butter, which we recollect over to have heard of. They had in the <rs>South</rs> the most magnificent market for their manufactures to be found in the whole world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>It was untaxed and unrestrained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>They paid no duties, and were the only people in the world that paid none.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>Competition was not allowed to come near them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>Heavy tariffs shut it out from abroad, and our own people were engaged in other pursuits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>The coasting trade &mdash; the heaviest in the wired &mdash; was all done by their ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>The Southern cotton and tobacco, the great staples of the world, all passed through their hands on their way to a foreign market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>The very negroes, for whose sake they were constantly threatening the <rs>South</rs>, were a source of far more profit to them than they have ever been to their masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>The cotton and tobacco of the <rs>South</rs> were, indeed, the grand levers that set all Northern trade in motion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>Without them New York would never have risen much above the figure that represented her population in <dateStruct value="1810--"><year reg="1810">1810</year></dateStruct>, and <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> would have been, where she ought to be now, at the tall of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>The <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs> could see all this, but the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> could not, and they persisted until they destroyed the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/> The <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs> now wish to restore that Union, because while it existed it was a source of unalloyed prosperity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>They see plainly enough that if the <rs>North</rs> be compelled to pay the same duties with <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> will supplant the manufactures of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>They see that if direct trade between our ports and <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> be once firmly established, New York will cease to be the money centre of <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>They see that if the coasting trade be thrown open to competition, <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> will do the larger share of it. In a word, they clearly under stand that the destruction of the monopoly they have been so long enjoying will be a death blow to all Northern interests, for they know well enough the difference between framing tariffs to shut out all other people and having tariffs framed to shut out themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>When it is too late, the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> see this, too; and seeling also the hopelessness of restoring the <rs>Union</rs>, they are waging a savage war for the purpose of rendering a desert those portions of it which they can no longer control.--The <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs>, however, take a different view of the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>They believe restoration still possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>In this respect they do not manifest their usual sagacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>They have the incredible folly to believe that there still lurks among the body of that people who have fought against the <rs>Union</rs> as men never fought before, a sacral attachment to <q> &#x0022;the old flag,&#x0022;</q> which is the most detested of all earthly symbols to the whole body of the <rs>Southern</rs> people.--They do not reflect that while, to them, the condition which it is intended to represent has been productive of unalloyed blessings, it is associated in the <rs>Southern</rs> mind with images of commercial poverty and sectional oppression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>To this imagined feeling of latent loyalty to the <rs>Union</rs> they are willing to appeal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>They have no doubt that they will be successful.--But <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> they must beat us into the homer for submission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>They must make us know their strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>They must teach us that they are our masters. --They must kill an <num value="100">hundred</num> or <num value="2000">two thousand</num> of our men. They must take <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>They must crush the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>And then they will offer us terms, having <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> asserted the <unclear>suprem </unclear> of the <q>&#x0022;<rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> eagle,&#x0022;</q> as they are facetiously wont to term the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> buzzard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>They care, and pretend to care, nothing for the <hi rend="italics">nigger.</hi> They will be willing, after having conquered us, to agree upon any terms, provided the <rs>Union</rs> be restored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>They will consent to introduce slavery into every State in the <rs>Union</rs>, provided this grand object be attained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>If the <rs>Southern</rs> people will not agree to all this, as most assuredly they never will, then they are for carrying on the war to any extremity that would satisfy the most, <hi rend="italics">altar</hi> of the <orgName n="Abolition party" type="party">Abolition party</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>They will never consent &mdash; let <persName n="Buren,,John,,,Van" id="n-0001.0000.00000.00221" reg="expanded:Buren,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <nameLink>Van</nameLink> <surname>Buren</surname></persName> say what he may &mdash; to let the <q>&#x0022;wayward sisters&#x0022;</q> depart in peace. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/> It may be that a <orgName n="Democratic Congress" type="congress">Democratic Congress</orgName> might propose to the <rs>Southern States</rs>, as a condition of reentering the <rs>Union</rs>, to legalize slavery every where, and this before proceeding farther with the war &mdash; But even were the <rs>South</rs> disposed under any circumstances to reenter such a state of bondage, it must be borns in mind that the present Abolition Congress has still <num value="1">one</num> year to run. In that time some of the most desperate battles the world ever heard of will have been fought, and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> will already have conquered us or been expelled from our territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>So far, then, as the war is concerned, we shall gain nothing by the late Democratic victories, at least for the present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>As in the case of expected intervene on, we warn our people to trust to themselves, and to nobody and nothing else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>Nevertheless, it is pleasant to find Old Abe thwarted in the dearest wishes of his heart. </p> </div3>
