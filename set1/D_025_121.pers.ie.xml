<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>Let any man who can, in the face of all this, wonder that <persName n="Ireland,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00153" reg="mostcommon:Ireland,nomatch:0"><surname>Ireland</surname></persName> hates <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and would be glad to see her sunk in the bottom of the sea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>Yet that is precisely what we do see at the present moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>The <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> and the <name>Poles</name> are the foremost in the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> ranks &mdash; seeking to subject us to a despotism infinitely worse than that from which they have themselves escaped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>The Poles, like the <rs n="German" type="group">Germans</rs>, are all Red <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>Liberty, equality, and fraternization with all mankind, are the main articles of their political creed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>They hate everything which looks like feudal aristocracy, and they take the <rs>Southern Governments</rs> to be such, because of negro slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>They are as willing to fraternize with the negro as with anybody else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>They abhor every conservative element in every form of Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>They object, indeed, to all Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>They prefer anarchy and the rule of the mob. It is not surprising, therefore, that they should forget their obligations to the <rs>Southern</rs> people in their desire to establish the reign of indiscriminate plunder and the supremacy of disorder. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/> But the <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> are not Red <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs>--they are, of all the world, the least affected with the negro <hi rend="italics">mania</hi>--they are in general decidedly conservative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>That they have, almost to a man, or appear to have, a passion for arms, is true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>But that they should take up arms to deprive of their liberty men who, like themselves, are conservative; like them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>selves, are unaffected by Red Republicanism; like themselves, enemies to negropholists and their abominable tenets; and who, moreover, when there was a question of disfranchising them and proscribing their religion, and this, too, in defiance of their native priests, whose hold upon them is proverbially strong, and, as it is said, even of the <rs>Pope</rs> himself, who, like the priests in question, is believed to be opposed to the emigration which has filled the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> ranks with <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> soldiers &mdash; all this appears to us marvellous, or rather, perhaps we ought to say, it did appear marvellous, until the revelations of the last few days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>It now seems that there has all along been in existence in Yankeedom a society called the <rs>Femian Brotherhood</rs>, the object of the association being to entice <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irishmen</rs> into the ranks, under the promise that as soon as the <rs>Confederacy</rs> shall have been subdued, the <rs>Union</rs> will then exert its whole power to effect the liberation of <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName> by force of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>About <num value="300">three hundred</num> members of this association lately met at <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName> in Convention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>They came from <placeName reg="Eire" key="tgn,7001181">Ireland</placeName>, <placeName reg="Canada" key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>, and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> papers are very careful to disclaim for their Government all part or participation in this conspiracy to disme her the <rs>British</rs> empire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>It is nevertheless asserted that <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00158" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> not only knew of its existence, but encouraged its proceedings by holding out to the leaders promises of cooperation in their favorite project, provided the <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> would assist him in subduing the <rs>Confederacy</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/> We have always wished to see <persName n="Ireland,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00159" reg="mostcommon:Ireland,nomatch:0"><surname>Ireland</surname></persName> free.
