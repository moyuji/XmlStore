<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> All quiet around us. The sun is shedding a balmy warmth, a gentle breezs is making music among the whispering leaves, and but for the occasional clatter of passing cavalry, the rumbling of baggage trains and commissary wagons, and the returning regiments from duty on picket, <num value="1">one</num> would hardly select this staid old town and its enirons as the focus of the eyes of a nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Looking around me, not a campis visible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>The troops are acattered through the woods, on hill sider, and in the valleys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>A few <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> have their headquarters here, in cottages whose flowery surroundings are suggestive at once of peaceful tenants, and other buildings, great and small, are appropriated to various army purposes &mdash; some for ordnance, some for stores of provisions, some for grain, and some for blacksmith shops; but aside from the hustling life visible immediately around these, there is nothing to indicate the proximity of that great army which constitutes the <name>Chinese</name> wall of the <rs>Cotton States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>You only recognize its existence in the stillness of night, when <q>&#x0022;tatoo&#x0022;</q> rings from wood to wood, and the music of various regimental bands reverberates sweetly in the quiet air. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/> Go to the front, however, and there the picture of war bursts upon the vision in all its grim grandeur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>You may trace the camps for miles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>The canvas homes of the men loom up everywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Cavalry are staked off among shady trees; batteries whose brazen throats have belched defiance to the foe now nescle in pleasant groves; and men <unclear>loll</unclear> lezily on the soft grass, and awart coming events with an indifference almost amounting to stolidity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>An intense calmness pervades everything. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/> Our preparations are complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Little remains to be done except to feed the army, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> note of battle that sounds in our ears will find a welcome response in every hear., as a relief to the monotony of present camp existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>A recent tour among various regiments, and personal conference with both officers and men, satisfies me that an <hi rend="italics">eclat</hi> and spirit animates the army which has not been equalled since its organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>The battle of Shilch fully tested the comparative strength of the <num value="2">two</num> forces, and though on the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> day we were compelled to withdraw, the subsequent analysis, by the common sense of the men, of the <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure>&#x0027; fight has fully provan the superfority of our arms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/> The fact is beginning to be generally understood that on <name>Monday</name> we had not more than <num value="12">twelve</num> or <num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num> men on the field to contend with the fresh and overwhelming reinforcements of <persName n="Buell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:Buell,nomatch:0"><surname>Buell</surname></persName>, and our obstinate restatance on that occasion has given the encouragement, that with the additional forces now at command, and the splendid reorganization which has taken place, we shall be in truth invinclole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Again, it is to be borne in mind that in the fight of Sunday we took the steel out of <num value="40000">forty thousand</num> men. They who punished us at <placeName key="tgn,2031620" n="1.000 10" reg="Donaldson, Marshall, Indiana">Donelson</placeName> found their match at Shilch, and fied like routed sheep to the cover of their gunboats, so thorouguly whipped that they never will fight as well again. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> Again, there is not an individual in the army of the <rs>Mississppi</rs> who does not daily realize the superiority of our position, the extent of our preparations, and the apparent impregnability of our fortifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Confidence in our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> is supreme, and a spirit of emulation has been born among the various regiments that will result in deeds of valor of which Shilch alous can be a parallel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>We have an abundance of ammunition, artillery, small arms, and men. Add to these the noble impulses that actuate the latter, and what more is needed to give us the victory? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/> Our principal fear now is that the enemy will change his tacties, and either lie idle in his camp, or retreat down the <rs>Tennessee</rs> to wards <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName> end New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Every day or <num value="2">two</num> we hear of their reconnoiss inces along the lines, and occasionally the heavy booming of artillery tells of a skirmish; but we query whether these demonetrations are not more feints.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>A scout to- day brings intsiligence that the <rs>Federals</rs> are digging ontrenchments at <placeName reg="Pittsburg Landing, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2586587">Pittsburg</placeName>, Shilch, and various pleces between here and there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>An other report is that they have brought heavy slege guns, which they are planting preparstory to the attack, and will advance upon us by a system of regular approaches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>It this information be correct, a battle is imminent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>It not, we can gather nothing from the silence of the enemy as to his intentions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>As I remarked in my last, he will hardly be likely to fall back from this point upon the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, and allow us to get in his rear and threaten the country he has just left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>If he advances upon the <rs>Cotton States</rs>, it must be over us, or not at all. The border of the river is valueless to him as long as this army remains intact and undefeated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>That is, he may establish a river police of gunboats, but to garrison the cities captured would be an undertaking hazardous in the extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>A great car is that the object of entrenching himself on the line of the <unclear>T</unclear> is to compe us to assume the offentive, or remain idle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>In this case, the some order of things would be created which so long existed on the <rs>Potomac</rs>, with the exception that we may <q>&#x0022; attack at once and furiously.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/> All is a matter of speculation, however, for, even as I write, the enemy are vigorously bombarding our outposts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Windows rattle with every discharge, and the secondary report of the bursting shell fails upon the ear as distinctly as the crack of a rifle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>These skirmishes may be the prelude of a battle within <num value="24">twenty-four</num> or <measure n="48hours" type="date">forty-eight hours</measure>, but we have so often predicted and been disappointed among <unclear></unclear> seives that it is useless to look <unclear></unclear> present events; ranticipate trouble from what have how become its daily harbingers. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/> Since writting the above, several of the wounded have passed by the door of my hansome on foot and some in the rude ambulances which the surrounding country is made to afford.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>The sight is painfull and not less so because within the past year it has been of trequent reperition. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/> I cannot now obtain reliable details of the akirmish, though a <num value="1000">thousand</num> reports are in incirculation; but before the closing of the mail I will, if possible, append them in a postscript. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/> There is a caimness pervading everything to-night, which seems like the precurser of the coming storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>The faces of the men are stern and serious, and anxiety sits brooding upon every brow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Of levity there is none &mdash; The camps are deserted by all, save the sick and the servants; the troops are under arms and at their posts, and the long night watches will find them watting for the approach of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>Ah. what a sober moment is the eve of a battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>How the thoughts fly backward to the past, and forward into sternity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>Home parents, friends, and all the associations of <q>&#x0022;Anld Lang Syne,&#x0022;</q> come sweeping down the paths of memory and the hearty year us to lift the veil of the future, beqeath which lies embosomed our weal or woe.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/> To convey a more perfect idea of the affair, </p> <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/> I should observe that on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> Vant Born had placed himself so near the <rs>Federal</rs> front on our right, that the pickets of the <num value="2">two</num> forces were only <num value="400">four hundred</num> pards apart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>Suddenly, at nice o'clock, <num value="3">three</num> heavy guns from our sutrenchments broke the stillness of the evening air, and the whole army was in commotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>The <q>&#x0022;long roil&#x0022;</q> sounded, our men marched to their respective position, and every preparation was made for a fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>The enomy suspecting a stratagam from this unnsual hustle, and not wholly certain of its meaning, at once stampeded from their posision on the right, and fell backs mile or <num value="2">two</num> in the year of Furmington.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>The object of the signal it is of course imprudent ot reveal, but when murning came it found a portion of our army in <unclear>fullipursuil</unclear> and the troops <num value="1">one</num> and all fully inspired by the prospects of the upproaching engagement. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/> At <time value="11oclock">eleven o'clock</time> our advance came up with the enemy, their front being concealed in a heavy thicket on the opposite side of an immense field of some <measure n="400acres" type="area">four hundred acres</measure>. Haiting a few moments to allow the <rs>Confederates</rs> to form in their respective positions, a portion of <persName n="Dorn,,,,,Van" id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Dorn,nomatch:0"><nameLink>Van</nameLink> <surname>Dorn</surname></persName>'s and <orgName n="Huggles's Division"><persName n="Huggles,Division,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Huggles,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Division"></roleName><surname>Huggles</surname></persName>'s divisions</orgName> opened the ball.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>A <placeName reg="Louisland battery">Louisland battery</placeName> of <num value="6">six</num> guns, under command of <persName n="Robinson,,Feilx,Q.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="default:Robinson,Feilx,Q.,,"><foreName>Feilx</foreName> <foreName>Q.</foreName> <surname>Robinson</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, was thrown forward in the field, and for more than <num value="1">one</num> hour alone sustained the bruat of the conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>For fully half an hour the guns remained unsupported by infantry, while musket balls, round shot, and shell were whizzing in every direction around them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>Yet not a man faltered, and the battery won golden opinions for the gailant stand it made. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/> Once, and only once, a Federal regiment of cavalry came dashing down upon it like a cloud, sabres flashing and horses running like land, but in a moment there followed a series of wishes, and a volley of <unclear></unclear> them like leaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>Over <num value="40">forty</num> riders were dismounted, and the horses galloped frantically into our lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>The remainder returned discomfited, and no more was an attempt made by any protion of the <rs>Federal</rs> army to leave their covert. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/> Our troops, meanwhile, occupied the open field, and wherever an opportunity presented poured a heavy fire into the ranks of the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/> <persName n="Price,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="mostcommon:Price,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Price</surname></persName> had been ordered early in the day to make a <hi rend="italics">detour </hi> on our extreme right, so as to get in the rear of the <rs>Federals</rs>, and entriely surround them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>We, however, drove the enemy back in confusion, capturing all their knapsacks, loose clothing, and many wagon loads of baggage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>In fact, it may be said to have been a total rout.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>They attempted to save nothing but themselves, and that they did most effectually. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/> More than <num value="4">four</num>-<num value=".2">fifths</num> of our army were disengaged, but were drawn up in the awaiting the various developments of the engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>The force of the enemy was probably not less than <num value="5000">five thousand</num>, and our own engaged not more than <num value="2000">two thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>The result of the skirmish &mdash; for such it must be termed &mdash; was the occupation of <placeName reg="Farmington, Alcorn, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056417">Farmington</placeName>, the destruction of an important base of operations, from which the enemy intended to make demonstrations upon the <orgName n="Mobile and Ohio Railroad" type="railroad">Mobile and Ohio Railroad</orgName>, make an attack upon our fortifications when the proper time arrives and also complete their reconncisances, which have thus far effectually failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>They are now compelled to attack directly in front, or not at all. They have been completely outgeneralled, and our army is in better position in every respect than it would have been without the skirmish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>Our only misfortune was the failure to bag the entire opposing force, and this is due more to natural obstactes than the want of strategic ability on the part of our leaders. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/> Among other things indicative of the perfect organization of the <rs>Federal</rs> army was a telegraph line which they had erected between <placeName reg="Pittsburg Landing, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2586587">Pittsburg</placeName> and <placeName reg="Farmington, Alcorn, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056417">Farmington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>This we destroyed <hi rend="italics">in toto,</hi> with the exception of the instruments, which are now in our possession. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/> Our loss was alight, only some <num value="10">ten</num> or <measure n="12" type="killed">twelve killed</measure> and <num value="40">forty</num> or <measure n="50" type="wounded">fifty wounded</measure>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/> That of the enemy is doubtless much greater, but both their wounded and dead were, as far as possible, carried away with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>Being concealed in the woods, we had no means of accertaining the effect of our balls beyond the reports of the dozen or <measure n="20" type="prisoners">twenty prisoners</measure>, who describe the havoc as being very considerable.

<head>The Critical moment.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/> The enemy is near this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>Our own army stands between the corporate limits and the invader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>It is officered by brave men and composed of brave men, whose whole object has been to meet the enemy in the open field and try conclusions with him. The <rs type="role" reg="Commanding-General">Commanding General</rs> is <num value="1">one</num> of the most accomplished military men of his day &mdash; always cool and sagacious, and <num value="1">one</num> of the bravest and most determined of men. A great battle is imminent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>It will not be delayed if the disposition on our side is gratified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>We conjecture the enemy will himself not be permitted to put it off, if his object in doing so is to approach this city by engineering and siege.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>Our General will, no doubt, frustrate any such designs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/> Meantime the people of this city &mdash; the immediate prize contended for &mdash; exhibit a calmness and self possession highly creditable.--They have passed the pariod of excitement, and are ready for what may come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>They are aware that up to this time they have suffered few of the immediate afflictions of the war.--They have given every aid in their power to the cause; they have sent their fathers, brothers and sons to the field; they have nursed the sick and wounded, and opened their homes to the refugees; but the war has been conducted till now in distant battle-grounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>Now they are to hear the big guns and to wait anxiously the result of the deadly, struggle that for the time decides their fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>The moment will be trying &mdash; filed with emotions never to be forgotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>Let us bear it like a people conscious of right and relying implicitly upon that <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> which fails not in the end to secure the triumph of justice. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head>The foreign news.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/> The signs of resistiveness in the councils of the <num value="2">two</num> greatest powers in the world, with reference to the disturbed condition of affairs on this, continent, increase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>Their commerce and manufacturing industry are most seriously affected, and their national revenues must suffer diminution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>The distress amongst the people is intense and extensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>The Governments are surely pressed by the emergency in, which they find themselves and the interests they have to protect and foster. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/> But with all this we need not, we cannot, safely rely upon any measure, advantageous to us in their joint councils until we strike a more decided blow than we have yet given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>The assumption of positive neutrality for so many months deprives them of a pretext to interfere until something more is done &mdash; until a new phase is presented by the situation of the contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/><persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00062" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> is artful enough to keep his foreign relations in a well guarded condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>He will apologize to the great powers for every outrage of subalterns rather than fight until he has succeeded in subjugating the <rs>South</rs>, which he is sufficiently deluded to believe he can do. His present scheme is to flatter the <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> Governments that the proclamation of the re-opening of trade in the ports his forces possess will afford to them the raw material they so much need to give their people occupation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>It is true, they are to be undeceived both by the destruction of cotton in the <rs>South</rs> and the failure to plant a crop this year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>But when they are undeceived in this respect <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00063" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> will be again ready with another trick in political legerdemain for their diversion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>They have lost the pretext for breaking up the block ade of our ports &mdash; they have almost deprived themselves of all reason to interpose on any ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>Yet their situation is so pressing, and the grand political motive which makes them desire the perpetual dismemberment of the old Union so overshadowing, that if they can find a pretext they will in good time avail themselves of it, and offer their mediation at least.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>The best occasion for this would be <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> grand victories to the <rs>Southern</rs> arms in pitched battles. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/> We are not of opinion that it is especially desirable that <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> should intervene for the establishment of peaces in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>In the first place, we apprehend they will not propose mediation until we prove our own ability to achieve our independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>In the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, it is probable that they will be inclined to acknowledge the claims of the enemy to all the territory occupied by his forces, to which we can never submit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>We can never agree to any mode of settlement of the status of Southern territory occupied by <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00064" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abe,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s troops, which deprives the occupants of that territory of the right, without menace or threat, and without the presence of soldiers, to say to which Government they desire to be attached and owe allegiance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/> While of course the sentiment and policy of <num value="2">two</num> such kingdoms as <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> with reference to our struggle are deeply interesting to us, they have shown thus far such a stadious neutrality where they were called upon by the law of nations as construed by themselves to interpose &mdash; shewing a neutrality which operated indeed to the great advantage of our powerful enemy in giving him the free right to purchase and transport all the appliances of war, while we, without his means, machinery, and artisans, were almost entirely cut off from that privilege &mdash; cut off, too, when had we been able to supply ourselves fully we could have ended this war are this &mdash; that we are much more indifferent as to what they may do than we have been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>We have long ago come to the conclusion that we would never be the object of their friendly measures until they saw we were not particularly in need of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/><persName><roleName n="Emperor">The Emperor</roleName> <foreName>Napoleon</foreName></persName> might have been disposed to extend his good offices towards us, but this he could never do without the co-operation of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and thus he is made to pursce the same frigid policy adhered to by that Government. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/> After all, whatever the speculations we may enter into on this subject, we cannot avoid the conclusion that upon ourselves everything depends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>We must free ourselves from an hated dominion of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> <persName><foreName>Puritanism</foreName></persName> and Northern oppression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>When we have done that, we shall have plenty of friends, and we shall make just what terms we please with them. </p> </div3>

<head>An Execrable military Despot.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/> The order of <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00065" reg="nearbymention:Butler,Frederick,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName>, said to have been issued recently in New Orleans, is the most brutal and atrocious act of the military despotism extended over so much of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>It will be found noticed elsewhere in this paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>Yet he has so much of cunning and shrewdness that we are almost inclined to doubt the authenticity of the paper attributed to him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>Again, it may not be very surprising that the man who threatened the people of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> with, assassination by servile agency, should issue even such a paper as this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>It will indeed shock the civilized world; and the man whose arm will not feel nerved by it to strike a heavier blow upon the enemy, must not only be base born, but dead to all the instinots of humanity. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/> We take occasion again to urge our people to plant an unusually large supply of vegetables, especially potatoes, cabbage, and tomatoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>They will be greatly needed in the camps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>The soldiers will require large quantities of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>Without a plentiful supply of vegetables, the sickness in the army must be increased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>Every man who cultivates the soil in this way can do much to help along the cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>It is exceedingly grateful to the sick and suffering from fatigue and exposure to obtain good vegetables.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>It is as beneficial to their health as it is gratifying and refreshing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>We therefore implore our people to put in large crops of all kinds of vegetables, but especially of those named. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/> In the annered communication will be found a suggestion which may prove of service in the defence and protection of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>It is properly remarked that no <num value="1">one</num> means of defence should be implicitly relied upon, and the writer evinces confidence in his suggestion: </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/> Strategy is often the better part of military defence, and it may with justice be said that no General is or can be master of his profession who is not fertile in invention as well as energetis in action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>Engaged as we are in a terrible contest with an unscrupulous and powerful foe, who will spare neither hororable nor <hi rend="italics">disbonorable</hi> means to effect our subjugation, it is our bounden duty to use every appliance that nature or nature's <name n="God" type="God">God</name> has placed within our reach to inwart him in his designs and hurl upon him that vengeance so justly due to his crimes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>Our Capital is now threatened by land and water by the hirelings of, to us at least, a loathsome despotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>The noble resolve of our chiefs to defend it to the last has already sent a thrill of joy throughout the length and breadth of the land; and in that resolve, sternly maintained, each citizen feels a security <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> only to a successful battle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/> The proximity of the enemy, however, suggests the inquiry, if additional means may not be prudently prepared for our river defences?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>The water is evidently our most vulnerable paint; secure there, and we feel safe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>The obstructions placed in the river are formidable, if not impassable to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>Yet nothing human is perfect; accidents may happen; a freshet may injure the obstructions, or an overwhelming force may possibly remove them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>What then?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>Must <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> fall?
