<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> There is a current rumor in camp that appeals of prominent Tennesseeans for an immediate movement into <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName> is about to be granted by the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> <persName n="Johnson,the Honorable,Andy,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="default:Johnson,Andy,,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">Hon.</roleName> <foreName>Andy</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName> and <persName n="Maynard,the Honorable,Horace,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="default:Maynard,Horace,,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">Hon.</roleName> <foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Maynard</surname></persName> have been urging this movement vehemently, as essential to the salvation of the <rs>Union</rs> men of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Readers are supposed to be familiar with their arguments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>I will not therefore, recapitulate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>But the rumor of movements caused much enthusiasm among the <name>Tennesseeans</name>, whose anxiety to return to their homes is intense &mdash; Their desire is paramount.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Every other feeling is merged in it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> I placed no confidence in the report, because we cannot move.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>This column is not strong enough to invade <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>To be sure there is no enemy at the <rs type="place">Gap</rs>, excepting a small garrison, and if we should move forward it is not likely there would be much fighting at that point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Our latest information from the <rs type="place">Gap</rs> &mdash; believed by the <rs>General</rs> to be perfectly reliable &mdash; is that the rebels have obstructed the <rs type="place">Gap</rs> with large masses of rock and fallen timber, to an extent which makes it impassable, either by us or by themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Advices are also received that they have obstructed Big <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">Creek</rs> Gap, below <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName>, in a similar manner, and that the main portion of <persName n="Zollicoffer,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Zollicoffer,nomatch:0"><surname>Zollicoffer</surname></persName>'s forces have moved to some other point not known. </p> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> An order has just been issued ordering every regiment in this brigade to move at <time value="8oclock">eight o'clock</time> this evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The object of it is not generally understood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Those to whom it has been explained are surprised and chagrined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The column is ordered to move back as rapidly as possible to <placeName reg="Crab Orchard, Lincoln, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038350">Crab Orchard</placeName>, and to transport all the sick who can be removed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The order was predicated upon an order from <persName n="Thomas,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName>, who forwarded it by express relays from <placeName reg="Crab Orchard, Lincoln, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038350">Crab Orchard</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>It is reported that a heavy column, divested from <orgName n="command"><persName n="Buckner,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Buckner,nomatch:0"><surname>Buckner</surname></persName>'s command</orgName>, is running rapidly forward upon <placeName reg="Somerset, Pulaski, Kentucky" key="tgn,2041357">Somerset</placeName>, to cut us off. Thus you perceive that a big scare is at the bottom of the retrograde operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>It is not necessary to speculate on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>I suspect, however, that this is but a brilliant cover for the ridiculous termination of the great <placeName reg="Cumberland Gap, Claiborne, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098735">Cumberland Gap</placeName> expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>It may have been devised, also, as a decent apology for recalling the <rs>Tennessee</rs> regiments. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>This march was as disastrous as a battle and defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>During the night a decayed tree was blown down in camp and several men dangerously wounded--<num value="1">one</num> said to be fatally. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> The same correspondent gives a lengthy statement of the incidents of the march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>We extract the following from the diary of the writer: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/><hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>,</hi><placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Ky.</placeName>,<date value="11-13">November 13.</date> --Long before <time value="8pm">8 o'clock, P. M.</time>, most of the troops of the <rs>Wildcat Brigade</rs>, with <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> rations in their haversacks, were prepared to march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The sick who could be removed &mdash; and there were many too feeble to walk, yet able to ride &mdash; were transferred to those wretched instruments of torture to the ill or the healthy--<num value="2">two</num> wheeled ambulances and to common army wagons, some of which were uncovered, thus exposing men to the raw night air. But many poor bed-ridden fellows who were necessarily left, remained confined to the hospitals, a prey to harrowing apprehensions of captivity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Of course surgeons and guards were detailed to minister to their wants and protect them until they should be removed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>But how many men were closely packed in ambulances and wagons, I could not learn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/><persName n="Steedman,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Steedman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Steedman</surname></persName> would not leave any, and he had over <num value="100">one hundred</num> stored away as comfortable as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>The <rs>Surgeon</rs> of the <orgName type="regiment" key="IN33">Thirty-third Indiana</orgName>, horrified at the order, protested vehemently, but he was informed decisively, the orders from headquarters is that all the sick must be removed, and orders must be obeyed. </p></q><bibl n="The diary of the writer"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> He still protested that a removal would result in the death of some of his patients, and he was told to quarter them with private families at <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>But the <orgName type="regiment" key="IN33">33d Indiana</orgName> brought away <measure n="189" type="sick">one hundred and eighty-nine sick</measure>. I did not inquire how many were removed by other regiments, but the number was large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Besides, many feeble fellows just discharged from the hospitals, but unfit for duty, shouldered their muskets and donned their heavy knapsacks, preferring the cruelties of a forced march to the hazards of captivity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> The <orgName type="regiment" key="OH14">14th Ohio</orgName> had the right of the column.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Shortly before <time value="8oclock">8 o'clock</time> it marched solemnly by the camp of the <orgName type="regiment" key="OH17">17th Ohio</orgName>, its band mournfully playing the dead march &mdash; thus expressing the emotions of the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>It was followed by <persName n="Standart,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Standart,nomatch:0"><surname>Standart</surname></persName>'s and <orgName n="batteries"><persName n="Kenney,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Kenney,nomatch:0"><surname>Kenney</surname></persName>'s batteries</orgName>, with the baggage trains of each of the foregoing corps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="OH17">17th Ohio</orgName> fell in their rear, and its sarcastic lads, keenly appreciating the occasion, burst into a satirical paraphrase of their favorite regimental ditty, <num value="1">one</num> strain of which runs somewhat thus: </p> <cit><q> <lg type="stanza"> <l>&#x0022;Old Zollicoffer can't take us, </l><l>Can't take us, can't take us, </l><l>On a long summer's day.&#x0022; </l> </lg> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> It was impromptu at the <name>Wildcat</name> fight, so was the song as they retreated: </p> <cit><q> <lg type="stanza"> <l>&#x0022;Old Zollicoffer can't catch us, </l><l>Can't catch us, can't catch us, </l><l>&#x0027;Cause we're running away.&#x0022; </l> </lg> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> More forcible than elegant, and more expressive than poetical. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> And so each regiment, followed by its baggage train and sad procession of invalids, moved up the road, melancholy and mad.--Most of the <name>Tennesseeans</name> had fallen in behind the <orgName type="regiment" key="OH14">14th Ohio</orgName>, and moved on sullen and sorrowful, bitterly expressing their disappointment, and denouncing the frauds with which they had been deluded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Some were imbued with the idea that they were to march up the <placeName reg="Somerset, Pulaski, Kentucky" key="tgn,2041357">Somerset</placeName> road &mdash; about <placeName><distance reg="3miles">three miles</distance> above <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName></placeName> &mdash; to meet the enemy, and agreed to go that far, but not beyond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Upon reaching that point the head of the column failed to halt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>A few Tennesseeans madly broke from the ranks and moved back towards camp.--Several threw themselves sullenly on the ground and refused to march. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/> As we moved forward, they continued to leave the ranks in pairs and squads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Then squads multiplied into sections, sections into platoons, and platoons almost into whole companies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>A private came back from the front and appealed to an officer to stop the deserters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>He said the regiment was disorganized &mdash; the men were going back to <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>; their officers could do nothing with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>The poor fellows, with despairing exceptions, continued to proclaim their loyalty, but could not stand the disappointment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Occasionally a stout-hearted fellow would proclaim his determination to follow the flag wherever orders carried him--<q>&#x0022;but it is hard on Tennessean, boys,&#x0022;</q> he would say to the <name>Buckeyes</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>In a march of <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> we must have passed <num value="200">two hundred</num> stragglers.--Some were lying prone on the ground, sobbing; some stood by the highway, swearing defiantly; others leaned against the fence, sullenly, undetermined whether to move <num value="1">one</num> way or another. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/> Here was the adjutant of the regiment addressing a squad, <q>&#x0022;For <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> sake, boys move on. Look at the <name>Ohioans</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Don't let them beat you. You are fighting for the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>Let's keep, Tennesseeans, together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Come, boys.&#x0022;</q> <q>&#x0022;Well, adjutant,&#x0022;</q> said <num value="1">one</num>, <q>&#x0022;It will do for you who ride, to talk, but we who do nothing but march up and down this infernal road, don't appreciate it.&#x0022;</q> <q>&#x0022;Get on my horse, and I'll walk.&#x0022;</q> said the adjutant, and the transfer was made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>And so the column trudged on heavily, and halted for jaded teams to dislodge from the mire, or pushed ahead, leaving <unclear>ve</unclear> to be extricated by whomsoever would do it. At <time value="12am">midnight</time> there was a long line of straggling Tennesseeans, from the head of their column clean back to their camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>It was marked by the lurid hue of the atmosphere, illumined by their blazing <unclear>bivouse</unclear> fires in the forests, around which they huddled in shivering groups.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Hardly a <unclear>nuclear</unclear> for the regiment was left in column, though many stout fellows pushed on, determined to follow where orders commanded.--But there were pitiful scenes, and heart-touching. </p> <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/> Soon after <time value="12am">midnight</time>, the <orgName type="regiment" key="OH14">14th Ohio</orgName> and the artillerymen, after scaling <placeName reg="Wild Cat heights">Wild Cat heights</placeName>, flung themselves headlong on the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>None were covered that night &mdash; or morning &mdash; save by blankets and a veneering of cold, white frost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>The sick, too, in the open wagons, lay shuddering and shivering and moaning in the sharp, cutting atmosphere of a <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="OH17">17th Ohio</orgName> halted and bivouacked at <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time>, in the camp which <persName n="Zollicoffer,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Zollicoffer,nomatch:0"><surname>Zollicoffer</surname></persName>'s rebels had occupied the night before their repulse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>I have told you where the <name>Tennesseeans</name> were, but I know not where was the remainder of the brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>The <orgName type="regiment" n="KY3">Kentucky 3d</orgName>, (<persName n="Garrard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Garrard,nomatch:0"><surname>Garrard</surname></persName>'s,) I believe, did not move that night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>I know not why. The <orgName type="regiment" key="OH38">38th Ohio</orgName> and the <orgName type="regiment" key="IN33">33d Indiana</orgName> pushed forward to the summit of <placeName key="tgn,2041954" n="1.000 10" reg="wild cat, clay, kentucky">Wild Cat</placeName>, and halted not long before day. The teams were also moving all night long. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/> The necessity to carry the sick obliged us to leave much stores and ammunition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>I am told we left <hi rend="italics"><num value="22">twenty-two</num> tons</hi> of ammunition at <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>And yet, readers, we are making a forced march to prevent the enemy from cutting us off, or to save <placeName reg="Blue Grass, Madison, Kentucky" key="tgn,2181485">Blue Grass</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/> Strange that soldiers should leave their ammunition and march to meet the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>At <persName n="Pitman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Pitman,nomatch:0"><surname>Pitman</surname></persName>'s we met <num value="13">thirteen</num> wagons loaded with commissary stores, <hi rend="italics">en route</hi> from <placeName reg="Camp Dick Robinson, Garrard, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038052">camp Dick Robinson</placeName> for <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>These were unloaded immediately, and proceeded to <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> for patients and stores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>Some of the regiments had necessarily left their tents and camp equipage, so that even had fatigue permitted them to pitched tents they could not have enjoyed the luxury. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/> <date value="11-14">November 14</date>--A heavy storm of rain roused the bivouacked from sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Their blankets and clothing were saturated with water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>The morning was most dismal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/><placeName reg="Wildcat Heights">Wildcat Heights</placeName>, crowned with a heavy coronal of mist, frowned in dreary and discouraging altitude before us. The roads were already worked into a tough muck, and the pathway on the edges where the troops walked were slimy and slippery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>Beyond was <placeName reg="Rockcastle, Kentucky, United States" key="tgn,1129142">Rockcastle river</placeName>, swift, and reported unfordable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>But the word was <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="spa">en asant.</foreign></hi> The lads partook of their cold rations and hot coffee, and took up the toilsome march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>Every step was laborious to the sturdy, agonizing to the feeble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>Knapsacks almost too heavy under the fairest auspices were now doubly burdensome, and the pack-horse load was increased by the aggravating weight of water which soaked blankets and heavy army overcoats, and the nasty slime which splashed and plastered each man's breeches as high as his knees in front and rear, and filled his shoes until they overflowed with slush. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/> During the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> mile we passed <num value="1">one</num> baggage wagon capsized in a <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>Its load of commissary stores and baggage were lost.--The desolate teamster and jaded horses, bedaubed with mud, gazed at it dismally and hopelessly as we moved forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>Further up the hill <num value="6">a half dozen</num> wagons were stuck, and the poor animals could not move them.--A few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> further, barrels of bread were tossed out of wagons and left to destruction in the forests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>A stranger to the facts, passing, would have said, here is a terrified army fleeing from a pursuing enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/> Going up the mountains, we passed Tennesseeans; some are pushing on desperately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>Yonder is <num value="1">one</num> prone on a bed of leaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>His head is bolstered on a rotten stump.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>Exhaustion is graphically pictured on his lived complexion and his silent form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>He is unconscious, while he sleeps the sleep of distress, that the driving rain is beating mercilessly upon him. My comrade startles me--<q>&#x0022;Is he dead?&#x0022;</q> Oh, no; he's only an exhausted soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>He wears no shoulder straps with a silver star on each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>But it is yet early in the day. Surely it is not time for soldiers to yield to fatigue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>They have marched only <num value="1">one</num> night, and have slept the whole of <num value="1">one</num> or <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> on the damp, frosted soil. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/> Why in the name of humanity does not the commander send back messengers to halt this column?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>Is there imminent danger ahead?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>Cannot these failing men be halted for rest?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>At least let messengers be dispatched to inspire them to march, march, march, to resist the foe. Anything to renew their spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>But look at these wagon loads of sick soldiers.--See them shivering in saturated blankets, seated in pools of water which drip from their clothing as it pours from the clouds.--Hear their unceasing, discordant, and harrowing chorus of coughing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>Here are candidates for the grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>But the order is stern--<q>&#x0022;Bring all your sick.&#x0022;</q> <q>&#x0022;Oh,&#x0022;</q> said <num value="1">one</num> of the surgeons to me, <q>&#x0022;that was the cruelest order officer ever gave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>I protested in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>I urged that it would kill my patients.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>But come they must.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>I shall lose perhaps <num value="30">thirty</num> or <num value="40">forty</num> of my regiment, and it will plant consumption in the lungs of <num value="200">two hundred</num> more&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/> And here is another picture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>We splash along tediously through the mire, and mounted officers encourage their men by kind words of sympathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>Nearly all relieve feeble soldiers by carrying their knapsacks and muskets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>The captains on foot emulate their superiors, and encourage them by example. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/> At <placeName reg="Rockcastle, Kentucky, United States" key="tgn,1129142">Rockcastle river</placeName> the column is victoriously over <placeName key="possibilities=13" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Wildcat</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>The dismal train halts at the ferry in mud and rain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>The jaded men fall asleep on the sod of a neighboring meadow, waiting the slow process of crossing all the column in <num value="1">one</num> small float.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>The teamsters stuff their worn-out animals with corn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>A few, in desperation, plunge into the ford where the water is swift, and some narrowly escape a watery grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="OH14">14th Ohio</orgName> loses <num value="2">two</num> wagons and contents, including <num value="25">twenty-five</num> or <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> rounds of ammunition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>How much more was lost, I do not know. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/> This was morning, but the column was long after night in crossing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>Afterward throughout the day the scene already described increased and assumed more aggravating forms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>The road constantly became more wretched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>Men flung away their knapsacks and stalked onward in utter desperation, their officers refusing to see insubordination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>Some stumbled and fell by the wayside, where they lay and slept the sleep of exhaustion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>And the sick in the uncovered wagons, and those accursed ambulances, were racked and pounced over rocks and ruts until their weak bones ached, their countenances testifying to their utter wretchedness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>And thus, hour after hour, through mud and slime and rain, over rocks and rails and logs, up the roughest and steepest grades, and down the ruggedest descents, our weary, footsore, exhausted soldiers and jaded teams struggled and toiled in pain all the miserable day and far into night; for even at <time value="12am">midnight</time> feeble straggler staggered into <placeName reg="Mount Vernon, Rockcastle, Kentucky" key="tgn,2040405">Mount Vernon</placeName>, where the <num value="14" type="ordinal">14th</num> and <num value="17" type="ordinal">17th</num> rested, to find their comrades. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/> This night the poor lads went to bed supperless, for fatigue was overpowering, and sleep sweeter than meat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>Some of them marched <num value="14">14</num>, some <measure n="16miles" type="distance">16 miles</measure> that day--<num value="13">13</num> the night and morning before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>This day's work was more disastrous than ordinary battles--<name n="God" type="God">God</name> knows how many sturdy constitutions it wrecked, how many brave volunteers it will kill. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>The former was more deliberate, but suffered its proportion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/> The amount of physical suffering caused by this march cannot be computed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/> The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> objects that strike the eye of the beholder are scores of blackened and tottering chimneys, standing like mournful monuments of the desolation and ruin beneath.--Passing the outer <orgName n="Picket Guard" type="guard">picket guard</orgName> of the <rs>Union</rs> troops at the opposite end of the bridge, we followed a scouting party to the distant end of the town, and observing that the coast was clear, proceeded to explore the ruins.--<persName n="Hampton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Hampton,nomatch:0"><surname>Hampton</surname></persName> was a place of some importance; there is the <rs type="place">Richmond turnpike</rs> which went through the heart of the place and formed the principal street.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>On <sic>this are</sic> the ruins of a bank, fine brick residences and spacious hardware, grocery, and other stores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>On the outskirts of the town, on this street, stands the old <orgName n="Episcopal Church" type="church">Episcopal church</orgName>, of which we give a full account herewith. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/> This main street is intersected by others at right angles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>The sidewalks of the former were payed with bricks like those of <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, with wooden curbs; the sidewalks of the latter were neatly graveled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>As is customary in the <rs>South</rs>, each brick or frame residence had a beautiful garden; some had bowers and some summer houses, covered with climbing roses, blooming even now, and wasting their fragrance upon their veritable desert air that fills this vacuum of the Old Dominion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/> In walking over the ruins, we found tin pans, kettles, stove-plates, and parts of every description of housekeeping articles lying around in the ashes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>Each house had its well of pure water, bricked up to the surface; these are now about half filled with dirty water and rubbish, and as they are mostly covered up with ruins, <num value="1">one</num> is as apt to step into as over them; so, should any other person visit <placeName reg="Hampton, Hampton, Virginia" key="tgn,7013687">Hampton, Virginia</placeName>, we would advise them to be as careful of these wells as they are told to be of the lizards that infest the ruins of <placeName key="possibilities=25" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Jerusalem</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2113290" n="1.000 4" reg="nineveh, warren, virginia">Nineveh</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>Winds whistle through the crevices &mdash; worms and insects revel in the most secret places, and the silence, if ever broken, is only by the wing of some bird of darkness, or the sharp crack of the rifle of a distant picket. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/> It was almost sunset as we strolled into the antiquated ruin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>Some were seated upon the graves near the church, some climbing to almost inaccessible places on tottering walls, and some seeking for roses in the deserted gardens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>This task seemed like a mockery, yet we joined in the pursuit, and plucked many buds from the flower beds that now have no owners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>There was but little evidence of care on the part of the old residents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>Some of the choicest plants had doubtless been removed, but the beds were without symmetry or form, and in all of them the thistle was springing up green and luxuriant, thriving only as only ill weeds can thrive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>A few white snow drops reared their modest heads, and seemed to brave the storm of desolation which had swept around. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/> At the western end of <placeName reg="Hampton, Hampton, Virginia" key="tgn,7013687">Hampton</placeName> there are a number of frame sheds standing, which are said to have been occupied by the rebels before they burnt the dwellings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>In these woods the rebels are posted, and occasionally they come in sight with a small body of infantry and a couple of howitzers, headed by a squadron of cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>When this is the case, our skirmishers are sent out to meet them; the enemy delivers a round and then falls back (some <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure>, it is supposed,) and our troops return. </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/> Now, we had supposed that, if Train was anything, he was an original.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>But here we find him stealing the ideas of another great military character, who, like the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> that took <placeName key="tgn,3000601" n="1.000 10" reg="cape hatteras, dare, north carolina">Hatteras</placeName>, inaugurated, or wished to inaugurate, a <q>&#x0022;new system of tactics,&#x0022;</q> and was only a little less boastful than the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> themselves, with very little more reason than the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> can show.
