<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>The circumstances under which you have assembled are full of import.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>You need not be told that evil times have befallen the great Government with which we have been connected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>Rent by dissentions, its component parts stand in hostile array.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>They have marshaled powerful armies, who have already engaged in deadly conflicts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>The <rs n="Cherokee" type="nativeamerican">Cherokees</rs> will be concerned in its issue, which, in all probability, it now appears will be the establishment of the new Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>The attention of your authorities was early directed to the subject from their position, and by correspondence with officers of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, and the delicate and responsible duty devolving upon them of deciding to some extent the course to be pursued by the <rs n="Cherokee" type="nativeamerican">Cherokee</rs> Nation in the conflict between the whites, to whom she was equally bound in peace and friendship by existing treaties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>Our political relations had long been established with the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States Government</orgName>, and which embraced the seceding as well as the adhering States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>Those relations still exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have not asked us to engage in the war, and we could not do so without coming into collision with our friends and neighbors, with whom we are identified by location and similar institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>Nor, on the other hand, had we any cause to take arms against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and prematurely and want only stake our lives and all our rights upon the hazards of the conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>I felt it to be my duty, therefore, then to advise the <rs n="Cherokee" type="nativeamerican">Cherokee</rs> people to remain neutral, and issued a proclamation to that effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>I am gratified to know that this course has met the approbation of the great mass of the <rs n="Cherokee" type="nativeamerican">Cherokee</rs> people, and been respected by the officers of both Governments in a manner that commands our highest gratitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>Our soil has not been invaded, our peace has not been molested, nor our rights interfered with by either Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/> The position I have assumed in regard to all the important questions which affect the <rs n="Cherokee" type="nativeamerican">Cherokee</rs> people, has been too often proclaimed to be misunderstood, however much it may be misrepresented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>The great object with me has been to have the <rs n="Cherokee" type="nativeamerican">Cherokee</rs> people harmonious and united in the full and free exercise and enjoyment of all their rights of person and property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>Union is strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>Dissension is weakness, misery, ruin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>In time of peace, enjoy peace together; in time of war, if war must come, fight together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>As brothers, live; as brothers, die. While ready and willing to defend our firesides from the robber and murderer, let us not make war wantonly against the authority of the <rs>United</rs> or <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, avoid conflict with either, and remain strictly neutral on our own soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>We have homes, endeared to us by every consideration, laws adopted to our condition, of our own choice, and rights and privileges of the highest character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>Here they must be enjoyed, or nowhere else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>When your nationality ceases here, it will live nowhere else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>When these homes are lost, you will find no others like them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>Then, my countrymen, as you regard your own rights, as you regard the welfare of your posterity, be prudent how you act. The permanent disruption of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> is now probable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>The State on our border, and the <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> Nations about us, have severed their connection from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and joined the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>Our general interests are inseparable from theirs, and it is not desirable that we should stand alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>The preservation of our rights and of our existence are above every consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>And in view of all the circumstances of our situation, I do say to you frankly that, in my opinion, the time has now come when you should signify your consent for the authorities of the <name>Nation</name> to adopt preliminary steps for an alliance with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> upon terms honorable and advantageous to the <rs n="Cherokee" type="nativeamerican">Cherokee</rs> Nation. </p>

<head>A French correspondent's view of the war in <placeName reg="America, McCurtain, Oklahoma" key="tgn,2131961">America</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/> The following is an extract from the translation of an <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> correspondence, which appears in the <rs>Paris</rs> journal, <foreign lang="fre">L'Opinion Nationale,</foreign> of the <date value="08-19">19th August.</date> It is interesting, and obtains some importance from the fact of its appearing exclusively in <placeName><persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>Napoleon</foreName></persName>'s home</placeName> organ &mdash; a New York paper going so far as to assert that the letter was written by the <rs>Prince</rs> himself, or at his dictation.--The letter is dated New York, <date value="07-31">July 31st:</date> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/> In the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> the individual initiative is everything, just as in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> the governmental initiative is everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>And so even the military organization rest naturally among <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> on principles entirely at variance with those on which we act. I confess that in this respect the system of self-government reaches almost the extreme limit of the possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>Up to the present the enrollment of volunteers goes on pretty well, but it cannot be expected that <num value="400000">four hundred thousand</num> fighting men can be raised in that way. You know better than any <num value="1">one</num> that <num value="400000">four hundred thousand</num> fighting men is no small affair when they have to be raised, supported, paid, and made to fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>But yet I do not see why, at the rate at which things go on, the <rs>Union</rs> might not reassemble <num value="60000">sixty thousand</num> volunteers, which would be quite a respectable force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>At present, or within a few days, when the last of the militia regiments shall have withdrawn, there are not, or will not be, any but volunteers under the standard of the <rs>Union</rs> and in the positions that protect <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>You will probably inquire, among what classes of the population volunteers are recruited, and what is the motive that impels the volunteers to enlist &mdash; patriotism or the <measure n="11dollars" type="currency">eleven dollars</measure> a month? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/> I confess that I have seen enough volunteer regiments to hazard an opinion on that point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>The opinion of those who look upon the worst side of things is that, in contrast with the <hi rend="italics">personnel</hi> of the militia, which represents the middle, industrious, honest, but not very warlike class of the population, the volunteer army will only present the scum of emigration, and will be recruited among that floating mass of adventurers whom <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> sends to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and whom work disgusts as well in the <rs>New</rs> as in the Old World.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>It is certain on <num value="1">one</num> side, that it is not the millionaire bankers of <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> and New York that become simple Zouaves; and on the other, that foreigners prevail in the ranks of the new corps. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/> Hence the tendency you must have remarked to nationalize companies, and even regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/><placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, <placeName reg="Scotland" key="tgn,7002444">Scotland</placeName>, <placeName reg="Eire" key="tgn,7001181">Ireland</placeName>, <placeName reg="Germany" key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> and <placeName reg="Italia" key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> have given their names, varied in a <num value="1000">thousand</num> shapes, to a great number of corps, the elements of which have been furnished by those countries respectively.--In the clashing of warlike nationalities, that which eclipses all others is the <rs>French</rs> nationality, personified, of course, in the <rs>Zouave</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>Everything at New York is in the <rs>Zouave</rs> style &mdash; fashions, handbills, theatrical spectacles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>More Zouaves (the uniform of the <orgName n="Imperial Guard" type="guard">Imperial Guard</orgName>) are met in the streets of New York than in the streets of <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>.--Whole companies are really composed of <rs n="Frenchman" type="propernoun">Frenchmen</rs>, who have served less or more, and who seem to look down upon all other soldiers--<rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs>, <persName n="English,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>, <rs n="German" type="group">Germans</rs>, &#x0026;c.--from the top of the tower of <placeName key="tgn,7005898" n="1.000 10" reg="Solferino,Mantova,Lombardia,Italia,Europe">Solferino</placeName> or the <name>Malakoff</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>I should be sorry to pass a rash judgment upon brave compatriots, who appear to me to be very careless, very gay, very sociable; but I cannot help reflecting upon what series of adventures have been able to bring these Parisians from the <rs type="place">Place</rs> Manbert to the shores of the <rs>Potomac</rs>, there to risk their lives for the greater glory of <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, at the rate of <measure n="11dollars" type="currency">eleven dollars</measure> per month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>Seriously, I do not believe that the <measure n="11dollars" type="currency">eleven dollars</measure> go for everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, with more clearness of vision than <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs>, English and <rs n="German" type="group">Germans</rs>, they appeared to me to reckon little upon the <measure n="11dollars" type="currency">eleven dollars</measure>; but what I can certify is, that they are quite insensible to the glory of the flag with the <num value="34">thirty-four</num> stars and the fate of the unfortunate negroes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/> You see by this what the weak side of all this organization is; it is not an affair of appreciation, it is an affair of arithmetic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>The weak side, the very weak side is the <measure n="11dollars" type="currency">$11</measure>. For <num value="100000">100,000</num> men, and on that footing, the expense is <num value="5.5">five and a half</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num> of franc per month, or <num value="60000000">sixty millions</num> per year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>For <num value="400000">400,000</num> men the expense is quadrupled--<num value="264000000">two hundred and sixty-four millions</num> per year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>And recollect that this enormous figure represents only the soldiers' pocket money; that the provisioning of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> soldiers is more abundant and more expensive than with us by nearly double; that, in fine, the most frightful dilapidation and disorder confessedly reign in what is called the military administration, and which is really only a continuation of measures adopted from day to day by localities for the account of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> for the purpose of supplying the prime necessities of the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>So the <rs>North</rs> <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> estimate the cost of the war at over a <measure n="1000000dollars" type="currency">million dollars</measure> a day. That is enormous for a country reduced to about <num value="20000000">twenty millions</num> of inhabitants, deprived of its great element of commerce &mdash; cotton &mdash; and enjoying a doubtful credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/><num value="1">One</num> thing that is certain is, that the militia soldiers have as yet seen nothing of the pay promised them; that at New York there have been disturbances caused by the tumultuary demands of soldiers' wives, to whom the pay of their absent husbands should have been handed, and who have made a useless outcry for it even at the doors of the <placeName reg="City Hall">City Hall</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/> As to the volunteers, those who are being formed in New York are well supported, but have not touched a cent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>I cannot speak of those who are with the army &mdash; because I have not seen them &mdash; but I am assured that their wretchedness was great, and that the streets of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> were full of soldiers stretching out <num value="1">one</num> hand for charity, and often handing a revolver with the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>But, I repeat, I will not see the army for a fortnight, and I am anxious not to let that which I have seen be confounded with, that which I have only heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/><num value="1">One</num> thing very singular for a <rs n="Frenchman" type="propernoun">Frenchman</rs> in this military system, and which I propose to look at more closely, is the absence of all organization superior to the regimental organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>Thus, up to the present, I have not been able to realize that regiments form brigades, constituted with titular generals; that brigades are collected in divisions, in <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">corps d' armce,</hi></foreign> with generals of division and of <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">corps d'armce,</hi></foreign> and with staff-majors that are not changeable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>It appears to me, until there is proof of the contrary, that when it concerns any operation having a character more or less special &mdash; such as the occupation of a frontier, the attack or the defence of a place, even a battle &mdash; the <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">general-in-chief</rs>, and sometimes Congress designates a general who takes the temporary command of the regiments assembled for that operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>It is thus that <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> generals pass and repass before our eyes, without the possibility of following them, step by step, in all the places of a war, as we do with our generals, whose military destiny is in variably linked with that of the constituted fractions, of which the titular command is confided to them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/> When the great battle of the <num value="21" type="ordinal">21st</num> was fought at <placeName reg="Manassas, Manassas, Virginia" key="tgn,2112877">Manassas Junction</placeName>, the direction of it was given to a General <persName n="McDowell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:McDowell,nomatch:0"><surname>McDowell</surname></persName>, without its being easy to say why; and what is still less comprehensible, is that <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Scott,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>, the generalissimo, a very brave, capable and esteemed soldier, gave the order to the whole army to attack the enemy, and to engage in a general affair, without going himself on the field of battle I reserve to myself to write you hereafter on the strategic position of the armies, as well on the <rs>Potomac</rs> as in the provinces, and I will endeavor to learn the truth on the subject of the battle of the <unclear> st</unclear> which was so shameful an affair for the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>That which I can tell you is that here, at New York, they have taken the matter very unconcernedly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>They have not appeared the <unclear></unclear> discouraged or humiliated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>The regiments that fled, abandoning everything &mdash; guns, baggage,&#x0026;c.--return to the city dully because their term of service has expired, and because they <milestone unit="column" n="6"/> confess they have had enough of war. Never mind; these brave people enter, and are received as conquerors, with music at their head, processions and acclamations of the people, flowers and illuminations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>It is not that they disseminate their retreat, or rather their rout.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>They relate to their fellow-citizens how they have been utterly routed, and these stories inflame the imaginations and exalt the enthusiasm of their hearers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>That is, doubtless, <num value="1">one</num> of the traits of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> character. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/> There is no question about peace or conciliation, and the public mind in the <rs>North</rs> is move opposed to it than ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>The hate between the <num value="2">two</num> parties is driven to an extraordinary degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>It must even be said that the <rs>Northern States</rs> have completely forgotten the original motives of the quarrel &mdash; tariffs, negroes, &#x0026;c. They have but <num value="1">one</num> thing at heart &mdash; that is, the honor of the <name>Confederation</name>, the insult done to the flag of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>The South has trodden it under foot; therefore the <rs>South</rs> must be subdued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>Necrophilism has always had an inconsiderable place in the quarrel, and has been only a pretext; to-day the word <q>&#x0022;abolition&#x0022;</q> is not even heard pronounced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>It is a war purely political, a war of passion; and it is really strange to see a people so positive, so attached to their material interests, so foreign to our traditional errors and to our Old World prejudices, if you choose, fight each other only for a sentiment, for a point of honor, and almost through a chivalrous spirit. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/> But there is nothing save contrast, or rather inconsequence, in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>They vote hundreds of <num value="1000000">millions</num>, well knowing that they will not pay them; they vote soldiers well knowing that the soldiers will not come; and in spite of an apparently very pacific disposition, they continue with an unequalled obstinacy a war which ruins them &mdash; a war without object, for all this affair can have but <num value="1">one</num> issue &mdash; the political separation of the <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, and the resumption of commercial affairs between them on the same footing as in the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>Prodigality and avarice, enthusiasm for the war, enthusiasm to stay at home, political fanaticism and egotistical speculations &mdash; there is the incomprehensible melange which I have found here. </p> </div3>

In view of the actual facts, it seems strange to us how such infatuation could ever have fastened itself upon the minds of men who have been supposed, above all others, to act habitually from the promptings of interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>While <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Beecher,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00044" reg="nearbymention:Beecher,Henry,Ward,,"><surname>Beecher</surname></persName></hi> was thus in flaming his <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> audience against the <rs>Southern</rs> people, and deluding them into the belief that separation was impossible, the train had already been laid, and the match lit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>The <rs>North</rs> has lost the trade of the <rs>South</rs> forever, and we shall now have a fair opportunity to see which of the sections can best dispense with the assistance of the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>It is not even necessary to wait the slow progress of time: we already know what the <rs>North</rs> drew from the <rs>South</rs>, and what she was able to supply from her own resources. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/> The entire exports of the whole Union amounted in value annually to about <measure n="325000000dollars" type="currency">$325,000,000</measure>. Of these the <rs>South</rs> exported in round numbers <measure n="250000000dollars" type="currency">$250,000,000</measure> in cotton, tobacco, rice, sugar, and naval stores.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>Nearly the whole of this exportation went to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and was paid for, not in <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs>, but in silks, <rs n="broad cloths" type="product">broad-cloths</rs>, wines, and other manufactures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>When these articles thus purchased arrived in port, they paid a duty of <num value="25">25</num> <hi rend="italics">per cent.,</hi> amounting in round numbers, to <measure n="30000000dollars" type="currency">$30,000,000</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>If the <rs>Government</rs> had depended for support on direct taxes equally and uniformly laid according to population, the <rs>North</rs> would have paid twice as much as the <rs>South</rs>; that is to say, she would have paid <measure n="54000000dollars" type="currency">$54,000,000</measure>, while the <rs>South</rs> paid <measure n="26000000dollars" type="currency">$26,000,000</measure>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/> The <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republicans</rs> say that the <rs>North</rs> paid the largest amount of duties, because it used the largest amount of imported goods.--The latter part of this proposition is true, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> false.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>The <rs>North</rs> certainly consumed <num value="2">two</num> <num value=".333">thirds</num> of the imported goods, but those goods were the property of the <rs>South</rs> when the duties were paid on them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>After the duties were paid, the <rs>South</rs>, not having a use for more than <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of them, the New York or other Northern merchants took the other <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>From the sale thus made, the <rs>South</rs> paid broker's expenses, and received, in lieu of money or foreign goods thus sold, a portion of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> manufactures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>Out of the value sent abroad--<measure n="250000000dollars" type="currency">$250,000,000</measure>--the <rs>South</rs> paid <measure n="60000000dollars" type="currency">$60,000,000</measure>, or <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> of the whole in duties--<measure n="50000000dollars" type="currency">$50,000,000</measure> more (that is <num value="0.2">20 per cent.</num>,) in commissions to brokers and importers in New York and <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>--<measure n="20000000dollars" type="currency">$20,000,000</measure> to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> manufacturer, in the shape of profit on his manufactures, sent to the <rs>South</rs> in place of the imported goods &mdash; and <measure n="10000000dollars" type="currency">$10,000,000</measure> to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> shipper, who carried these goods, foreign and domestic, to Southern ports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>After all this, the <rs>Southern</rs> man generally spent his summers at the <rs>North</rs>, and there got rid of at least <measure n="60000000dollars" type="currency">$60,000,000</measure> more of what was left him after these successive exactions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>A writer who is not often mistaken in matters of this sort, says that the <rs>South</rs> annually paid to Northern manufacturers, merchants, importers, brokers, shippers, and hotel-keepers, sums amounting in the aggregate to <measure n="231500000dollars" type="currency">$231,500,000</measure>.--It is easy to understand how their splendid cities, railroads, and canals were constructed. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/> The line of hills now in our possession are of some importance as positions of defence, and for little else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>The Federals have erected powerful field works opposite them, with bastions having heavy guns mounted <hi rend="italics">en barbette.</hi> They have also several smaller fortifications, stockade forts, redoubts with redans and lunettes, and various kinds of shelters, behind which the <orgName n="Light Artillery" type="artillery">light artillery</orgName> could be safely used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>I have said this line of hills is useful for making a defence; but as a base for offensive operations, it is of less value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>As far as my judgment goes, I should say that the best that could be done would be to erect counter-works, mounting some of our heaviest guns upon them, and then, under cover of their fire, a successful advance might be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/> When the armies are so close to each other it is not surprising that some small sally should be made occasionally, similar to those brilliant sorties so common during the <name>Crimean</name> war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>In our war these small skirmishes furnish the ground-work for the telegrams which appear in our daily papers, received in a majority of cases from <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> sources.
