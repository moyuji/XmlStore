<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The news of the enemy's appearance on the road soon spread through the country, and the conductor of the town mail train left the passengers at <placeName reg="Frederick's Hall">Frederick's Hall</placeName> <placeName><distance reg="50miles">fifty miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName></placeName>, and with the engine proceeded cautiously down the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>At every station he was stopped by persons who warned him of the danger, but the conductor, notwithstanding, continued on to the place, where, to his surprise, he found several companies of cavalry, who had heard of the raid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> did not interrupt the telegraphic communication, nor in any way interfere with the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> A gentleman, who arrived here yesterday from <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, informs us that a report was current there of a rebellion among the runaway negroes on <placeName reg="Roanoke Island, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014345">Roanoke Island</placeName>, that having become restless under the rule of self-constituted masters, they stole upon the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> while at dinner and put several of them to death; and that as soon as the soldiers were able to recover from the suddenness of the attack, they rallied and commenced an indiscriminate slaughter of the negroes, which resulted in their almost total extermination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>There seems to be some ground for believing this report for we have information from a high military source that the negroes in the neighborhood of <placeName reg="Roanoke Island, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014345">Roanoke Island</placeName> are leaving by every opportunity and endeavoring to make their way to our lines. </p>
