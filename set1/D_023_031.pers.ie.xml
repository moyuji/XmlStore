<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>It is true that many things have been said gratifying to the feelings of both parties, and on the other hand, in the warmth of debate, likely to be offensive, and it is more of human nature to think of that which is offensive rather than that which is gratifying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>Perhaps it may be answered as the <rs>Federal</rs> of all ranks answer us, and exult while they do so, that our own population are suffering, and that by putting an end to that war we shall be putting an end to our own distress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>Undoubtedly they are suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>As it stands, if we choose to avail ourselves of it, we have an easy way out of the whole difficulty.
