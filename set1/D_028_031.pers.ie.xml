<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> The comments of the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName>, published in a late issue of this journal, on the suggestion, which has been thrown out in some of the public prints, that <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> recognition might be obtained by the sacrifice of slavery, have at least the merit of great plainness of speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The journals which advocated that curious project can be at no difficulty in understanding the <hi rend="italics">Times.</hi> It is a great thing to be relieved from suspense and doubt by a prompt, sledge-hammer blow, that puts you at once out of your pain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>We scarcely wonder that the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> says we &#x0022;must dream dreams and see visions&#x0022; in the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> to entertain some of those eccentric notions with which we occasionally startle the world. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> The <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> can see the point of employing negro soldiers; but upon the scheme of emancipation to obtain foreign recognition it puts down its foot promptly and flatly. &#x0022;Every State of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>,&#x0022; says the <hi rend="italics">Times,</hi> &#x0022;acknowledged the <rs>Republic</rs> when it was governed by a Constitution permitting slavery as fully as the <rs>Southern States</rs> permit it now.--Why should its abandonment by the <rs>Confederacy</rs> buy a recognition that is withheld for many other reasons?&#x0022; Precisely!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>What could be more sensible?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Nay, the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> goes further; and, as if to put us out of our misery in case we entertain any eccentric notion of a <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> protectorate, says that <persName n="England,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:England,nomatch:0"><surname>England</surname></persName> will certainly decline it, and it knows no other <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> Power which would accept the offer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>It is the case of the <name>Netherlands</name> over again &mdash; no <num value="1">one</num> would receive us as a gift.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>We may, therefore, save ourselves the trouble of abolishing slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The best authority now assures us that slavery is not the reason we do not obtain <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> recognition. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> The truth is, neither <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> nor the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> desire the abolition of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>It is indispensable to the commerce of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>It is valuable, besides to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> in drawing off the attention of its own pauper population from the contemplation of their domestic grievances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The imaginary horrors of <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slavery kept constantly before the eyes of teeming and discontented multitudes of the Old World prevent them from brooding too intensely over their own grievances, and make their own condition appear comparatively comfortable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>In the meantime, slave-grown products are a necessary evil ! <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> knows well enough that the cotton of the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> States is the best that the world can produce, or it would long ago have obtained its cotton elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>We could much sooner obtain <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> recognition by threatening than promising to abolish <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>They would sooner interfere to prevent emancipation than to secure it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> We are glad that the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> has not only put an extinguisher upon the project of abolition, but has given us to understand that the interests of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> would not permit any <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> State to accept the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> even if we should tender them the gift.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>It is true, no rational being in the country has seriously entertained any such suggestion; but, after such mad projects as have been broached, there is no knowing what moonshine dreams may next flit across the human brain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Let us understand them once for all, that we must either belong to ourselves or to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The time was when a quiet citizen of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> could walk at <time value="12am">midnight</time> from Screamersville to <placeName key="tgn,2625188" n="1.000 10" reg="Rocketts, Henrico, Virginia">Rocketts</placeName> without dreaming of the garroter; when he could go to bed and awake and find &#x0022;the situation&#x0022; in the larder unchanged.--The time was when watchmen could snore with impunity and dogs had nothing to bark at but the moon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>A very difference <unclear></unclear> has arrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>A division of sappers and miners, composed of the most skillful engineers of the continent, is now quartered in the very heart of the capital, and lays bare, with unerring precision, every cellar and store-house in the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>It carries on its operations with an audacity equal to its genius, and is accompanied by heavy baggage trains, which carry off the spoils of war. It is evident that the occasion requires special measures of protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The civil police could much more hopefully be pitted against <persName n="Sheridan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,Philip,H.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> than against the sagacious and successful raiders who are now laying the town under contribution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The division of sappers and miners must be set upon by a division of Confederate soldiers and marched to the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>If they display half the talent and energy manifested upon our cellars and store-rooms, they will commit a successful burglary upon <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s fortifications in a week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Let the commanding general promise them all the provost they can capture, we would like to see the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> bolts and bars that will keep them out. If they never come back again, so much the better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>At present, no man when he lies down is sure of his breakfast the next morning unless he adopts the suggestion of a contemporary to put it in a balloon, and tie the cord to his wife's big toe.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> Not long after this time of the year the merchants of the <rs>South</rs> were went, in former days, to visit the <rs>Northern</rs> cities and make their spring purchases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>A good deal used to be said about direct trade with <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>; but the merchants were not to blame for going North any more than a plank on the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> stream for following the direction of that current.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The channels of internal commerce had become fixed, and the trade winds blew steadily in <num value="1">one</num> direction.--The universal taste of the people was for Northern productions, and there was not a little cross- roads store in the interior which could have kept its country custom if it had failed to furnish its semiannual supply of Northern wares and merchandise. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> It was useless to represent to the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> the value of direct trade with <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and the importance of developing their own manufacturing industry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Every article that they obtained from the <rs>North</rs> could have been furnished by <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, far superior in quality, and abundant in quantity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Or they could have made it themselves, and retained within their own limits the enormous annual tribute levied upon their industry by the <rs>North</rs>.-- <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> Nothing could wean them from their cherished dependence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>They hugged their chains, and called them jewels.--Even their books and newspapers must come from the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Their minds, as well as their bodies, must be arrayed is Northern fabrics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Their politicians went North for patronage, and even their sober religionists introduced Northern fashions of propagating virtue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Such a thing as self-dependence seemed to have become completely abnegated by the <rs>Southern</rs> community. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> Every spring, what piles of boxes, crammed with Northern goods, obstructed every pavement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>We now see the result of all this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>As soon as we ceased to go to the <rs>North</rs>, the <rs>North</rs> came to the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>The spring visitations of that interesting people find us unprepared to do the hospitalities of the occasion with becoming ceremonies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The vessels that used to bring goods up our rivers now bring guns and soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The spring that used to open with such fine assortments is now the signal for fire and blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>All this would not have been our independence would not have been difficult of achievement, if we had not parted with it before the war by refusing to supply our own wants by our own industry. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> It is to be hoped that when we emerge from this contest we shall not forget the lesson we have learned at such bitter and bloody cost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>If this war is to end in a resumption of old commercial relations with the <rs>Northern States</rs>, it might as well, it might better, have been never fought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The <rs>North</rs>, if wise, would acknowledge our national independence to-morrow, upon the stipulation that there was to be no dissolution of the commercial union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>For such independence would be merely nominal, and would in a few years cease to exist even in name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>His abilities were regarded with universal respect before there was any mention of the rebellion, and he stands in only the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> civil position in the rebel States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>The facts, than, at which we must look in relation to this delegation, all favor the view that it is quite as &#x0022;official&#x0022; as <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> the enemy could possibly make it; that it really represents their cause, and must have their confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>Although we have no great faith that it will reach any practical result, it is not impossible that it may; and, at least, the fact that it is sent to us is a significant <num value="1">one</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/> Just as this delegation arrives, the <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName> has finally passed a measure for the abolition of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>That measure, in order to be incorporated in our Constitution, must be adopted by the <name>Legislatures</name> of <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> of the <name>States</name> of this Union.--There are <num value="36">thirty-six</num> States--<num value="8">eight</num> support the rebel cause, and <num value="28">twenty-eight</num> are against it &mdash; so the measure will undoubtedly receive the sanction of the necessary number of States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>It was for the protection of that institution and to secure guarantees for its existence and extension that the war was begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/><measure n="4years" type="date">Four years</measure> of war have shown the <rs>South</rs> that they cannot hope to save that institution by force of arms; and now they see that they cannot hope to save it in any other way.--Before the war there were as many Northern States in support of the institution as there were Southern ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>Now the <rs>North</rs> is a unit of <num value="28">twenty-eight</num> States against it. This consideration has had a salutary effect upon the minds of the <rs>Southern</rs> leaders and people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>They all see clearly enough that by war slavery goes down, and that by peace slavery goes down; that it is done for in any other way, and that they might as well relinquish the fierce and bloody war that they entered into only to save it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>There was <persName n="Harris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00093" reg="nearbymention:Harris,Mary,,,"><surname>Harris</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, with the muscles of his face twitching and looking daggers towards the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>The movements everywhere indicated that momentous events were about taking place. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/> <time value="3:30">Half-past 3</time> arrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>An effort was made on the <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrat</rs> side to postpone the vote to another day. Almost every <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> member jumped to his feet, and the cries of &#x0022;No, no; vote, vote,&#x0022; rung through the hall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>At length the calling of the roll commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> motion was to lay on the table.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>The <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs>, with <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> exceptions, voted for this and solid against the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>The <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> being a majority, the motion to table was lost.--Then came the question of reconsidering the vote of last year by which the vote was lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>On this, the <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs> voted nearly solid against reconsidering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>At this stage there was no indication by the vote that the amendment was really to pass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>On the motion to reconsider the majority lacked some <num value="3">three</num> votes necessary to pass the amendment, or <num value="2">two</num> <num value=".333">thirds</num> of all present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>Then came the vote on the final passage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>Perfect silence, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, reigned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>The response of every member was watched, and as <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num> the <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs> changed front, there was an expression of joy on the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>Boldly, and like men fully realizing the important step, did <persName n="Ganson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00094" reg="mostcommon:Ganson,nomatch:0"><surname>Ganson</surname></persName>, <persName n="Radford,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00095" reg="mostcommon:Radford,nomatch:0"><surname>Radford</surname></persName>, <persName n="Nelson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00096" reg="mostcommon:Nelson,nomatch:0"><surname>Nelson</surname></persName>, <persName n="Steele,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00097" reg="mostcommon:Steele,nomatch:0"><surname>Steele</surname></persName>, <persName n="Rollins,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00098" reg="mostcommon:Rollins,nomatch:0"><surname>Rollins</surname></persName>, <persName n="Yeaman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00099" reg="mostcommon:Yeaman,nomatch:0"><surname>Yeaman</surname></persName>, English and others respond to their names.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>It was no faint whisper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>They responded like men who had weighed carefully the subject, taken their position after mature deliberation, and were ready to take the consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>It was an important step.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>In taking it, and responding in the affirmative, however, they only did that which many others on the <rs>Democratic</rs> side wanted to do, but had not the courage, the heart, to say aye. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/> The roll was concluded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>The honored names were all recorded, hereafter to be handed down in company with those who <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> recorded their names for that noble instrument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>Long before it was announced, the expression of the faces of those on the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> side showed too plainly the result, and that their joy was only being pent up, ready to burst forth the moment that the result was announced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>The sharp tone of the <rs>Speaker</rs>'s voice was soon heard announcing the vote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>In a louder, deeper and heavier tone than usual with him, <persName n="Colfax,Speaker,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00100" reg="mostcommon:Colfax,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Speaker">Speaker</roleName> <surname>Colfax</surname></persName> announced-- &#x0022;Having received a <num value="2">two</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> vote, the amendment has passed.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/> Then came a wild scene on the floor of the <rs type="place">House</rs>. <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> members waved their hats and cheered, the galleries took up the cry, handkerchiefs waved in the air, cheers echoed through the halls, and all dignity of the occasion seemed to be forgotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>Members were dancing, pulling each other around and performing all manner of antics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>Among the most amusing was the scene between <persName n="Brandegee,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00101" reg="mostcommon:Brandegee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Brandegee</surname></persName> and <persName n="Spaulding,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00102" reg="mostcommon:Spaulding,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Spaulding</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>They went through shaking of hands, hugging each other, and other wild demonstrations, finally closing up with rapturous kissing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/> The <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs>, during all this, sat in sullen silence, evidently disgusted at the lack of dignity on the floor, even those who voted for the amendment feeling that the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> were disgracing themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>It was certainly in bad taste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>It was a triumph well worth rejoicing over; but let that rejoicing, let the jubilee be postponed and held in some other place more benefitting than the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>The booming of cannon was soon heard in honor of the event. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>To Arm and Equip an Additional force of cavalry, there is need of Carbines, Revolvers, Pistols, Saddles and other accoutrements of mounted men. Arms and equipments of the kind desired are believed to be held by citizens in sufficient numbers to supply our wants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>Many keep them as trophies, and some with the expectation of using them in their own defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>But it should be remembered that arms are now required for use, and that they cannot be made so effectual for the defence of the country in any way as in the hands of organized troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>They are needed to enable our cavalry to cope with the well-armed and equipped cavalry of the enemy, not only in the <rs n="General Service" type="misc">general service</rs>, but in resisting those predatory expeditions which have inflicted so much loss upon the people of the interior. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>To the patriotic I need make no other appeal than the wants of the service, but I beg to remind those who are reluctant to part with the arms and equipments in their possession, that by keeping them they diminish the ability of the army to defend their property, without themselves deriving any benefit from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>A fair compensation will, therefore, be made to all who deliver such arms and equipments to any ordnance officer, officer commanding at a post, officers and agents of the <rs>Quartermaster</rs> and Commissary Departments at any station, or officers in the enrolling service, or connected with the <rs type="place">Nitre and Mining Bureau</rs>.
