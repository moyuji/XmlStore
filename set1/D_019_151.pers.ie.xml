<head>Details of the mob at Milwaukie &mdash; Disgraceful Scenes.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/> We find in the <placeName reg="Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin" key="tgn,7014071">Milwaukie (Wis.)</placeName> papers full particulars of the mob which attacked the banks in that city, a few days ago, because they refused to redeem the bills of country banks, as had been previously promised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>From the <orgName n="Daily Wisconsin" type="newspaper">Daily Wisconsin's</orgName> reports we take the following: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/> The mob <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> commenced at the <orgName type="division" n="Ward 2">Second Ward</orgName> Bank, about <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time>, and we are informed that they gathered about there in large numbers, and soon cleaned out that institution, of which <persName n="Jacobs,,William,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00172" reg="default:Jacobs,William,H.,,"><foreName n="William">Wm.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Jacobs</surname></persName> is <rs type="role2">President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>Then they came surging down <address><street n="East Water street">East Water street</street></address>, headed by a band of music, to <persName n="Mitchell,,Alex,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00173" reg="default:Mitchell,Alex,,,"><foreName>Alex</foreName> <surname>Mitchell</surname></persName>'s Bank, and gathered there by <num value="1000">thousands</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>There were several individuals in the bank at the time, and they were unable to get out. <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, they attempted to force open the doors, but the doors were barred, and entrance denied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>Then the rocks began to fly into the windows of <persName n="Mitchell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00174" reg="nearbymention:Mitchell,Alex,,,"><surname>Mitchell</surname></persName>'s Bank, and also into the windows of offices above and beneath the bank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>It was not long before the windows were completely honey-combed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>Great boulders were dug up from the pavement, and hurled in with a violence that must have resulted in killing any person, had he been struck favorably by them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>There was no particular noise during the riotous proceedings, except that there would be now and then a shout as the rocks flew through the windows, and there was that continued muttering, cursing and talking which always characterizes mobs of this kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>Occasionally, as some fright would arise, the crowd would retreat in confusion, and discovering it was a fright without cause, would advance again. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/> On the outskirts of the crowd were peaceable citizens, looking on in amazement, and not knowing what to do, nor what to look for next.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>The stairs to upper stories of buildings in the vicinity were crowded with men, women and children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>The windows of the buildings in the vicinity were filled with heads of both sexes, looking on the scene in silence and wonder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>Everybody seemed spell bound, although there were many and many who bit their lips and knit their brows, and felt within themselves, and said to those next to them, that this outrage had gone too far; that the citizens must rise up and put it down. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/> Meanwhile the men had broke into <persName n="Mitchell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00175" reg="nearbymention:Mitchell,Alex,,,"><surname>Mitchell</surname></persName>'s Bank, and many of them rushed in. They were resisted by the few who were inside &mdash; among them was <persName n="Brown,Mayor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00176" reg="nearbymention:Brown,John,,,"><roleName n="Mayor">Mayor</roleName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>; but the mob was too powerful for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>Now they went to work at the counters, tearing them down, cutting out the windows, seizing all the papers they could find, and tossing them out in the street.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>Property of all kinds was hurled in the street, and the bank was completely gutted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>Luckily, however, a large proportion of the valuables were in the vault, into which the crowd were unable to enter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/><persName n="Mitchell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00177" reg="nearbymention:Mitchell,Alex,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Mitchell</surname></persName> got out in sight of the crowd and attempted to speak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>But stones and clubs flew thicker and faster, the rabble roared, and he was obliged to retire. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/> Now came the turn of the <orgName n="State Bank" type="bank">State Bank</orgName>, directly opposite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>It only needed a start, and soon the windows of that institution were completely dashed in. A stone struck <num value="1">one</num> of the clerks, <persName n="Hayden,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00178" reg="mostcommon:Hayden,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hayden</surname></persName>, and injured him considerably.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/><persName n="Inbusch,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00179" reg="mostcommon:Inbusch,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Inbusch</surname></persName>, the <rs>President</rs>, barely escaped being struck on the head with a rock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>The destruction at that bank was nearly as great as at <persName n="Mitchell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00180" reg="nearbymention:Mitchell,Alex,,,"><surname>Mitchell</surname></persName>'s. They entered and tore up all the counters, broke up the furniture, and gutted out everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>The same violence was used in the banking office of <persName n="Martin,,J.,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00181" reg="default:Martin,J.,H.,,"><foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Martin</surname></persName>, under the <orgName n="State Bank" type="bank">State Bank</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>They afterwards took all the furniture of these <num value="3">three</num> institutions, and piling it into the streets, with all the paper and books they could get hold of, set them on fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>They also broke the windows of the banking office of <persName n="Bellinger,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00182" reg="mostcommon:Bellinger,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bellinger</surname></persName>, under the <orgName n="State Bank" type="bank">State Bank</orgName>, and gutted out his place of business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>The same vandalism was practiced upon the loan and <orgName n="Insurance Agency" type="agency">insurance agency</orgName> <orgName>office of Allis</orgName> &#x0026; <persName n="McGregor,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00183" reg="mostcommon:McGregor,nomatch:0"><surname>McGregor</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>Rocks were thrown into the windows of the <name>Bank</name> of Milwaukie. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/> By this time <persName n="Brown,Mayor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00184" reg="nearbymention:Brown,John,,,"><roleName n="Mayor">Mayor</roleName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName> had ordered out the <orgName n="Montgomery Guards" type="guards">Montgomery Guards</orgName>, but we understand (and if it is so, we regret to be compelled to say it,) that he ordered them out with blank cartridges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>This was only an invitation to the mob to fight, and a reckless imperilling of the lives of the <name>Guards</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>But the <name>Guards</name> marched against the crowd for some distance, driving them out of <address><street n="Michigan street">Michigan street</street></address> into East Water, where they came to a halt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/> Here the mob gathered about them, and for some reason or other the guards soon retired and marched back again to their armory.--Then the mob went to their work of destruction again; but the indignation and anger of the citizens had by this time become unrestrainable, and they determined to arm themselves with anything they could get hold of, and put down the mob, if they lost their lives thereby. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/> All this time <persName n="Hibbard,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00185" reg="mostcommon:Hibbard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Hibbard</surname></persName> and his <orgName n="Zouaves company" type="company">company of Zouaves</orgName> were at their armory, ready to act as soon as orders were given them from proper sources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/><persName n="Randall,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00186" reg="mostcommon:Randall,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Randall</surname></persName> had been telegraphed to, and the answer came for them to disperse the mob. Their captain led them forth, a single <num value="100">hundred</num> against <num value="1000">thousands</num> of mad desperadoes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/> The mob retired before them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>They formed in close order, and walked right through the middle of the rabble without a single gun being fired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/><num value="1">One</num> of the mob threw a butcher-knife, which came near hitting <num value="1">one</num> of the <name>Zouaves</name>, and the latter picked it up and stuck it in his belt as a trophy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/> Occasionally the crowd would hoot at them, and at <num value="1">one</num> moment they seemed about to make a rush back upon the <q>&#x0022;boys,&#x0022;</q> but the latter stood resolute with cocked muskets, and well was it for the crowd that no advance upon the troops was made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>The Zouaves finally cleaned out <address><street n="East Water street">East Water street</street></address>, and as we write are guarding the streets above and below the banks, and near the <rs type="place">Newhall House</rs>, with orders to fire upon any <num value="1">one</num> that attempts to break their lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/><num value="1">One</num> or <num value="2">two</num> fire companies also came out and assisted in dispersing the crowd, by squirting streams of water upon them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/> By <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time> order had been comparatively restored, but the mad spirit is not, of course, thoroughly quelled, and it behooves all our citizens to be on their guards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/>This is not a war against the banks, but against your homes and against the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/>Every man must be prepared to risk his life, if necessary, to put down any further outbreaks, should they be attempted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/> The men knew that there was no hope of escape from the pursuing and rapidly rising water, except through the pit shaft, and as this is the lowest part of the working, their fears were doubled by the knowledge of the fact that the water rising would soon block up the exit and leave them in the high workings, if not to be slowly drowned, at least with the alternative, quite as terrible, of death by suffocation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>The alarm was communicated to the men on the bank, and every effort was employed to save the unfortunate victims.
