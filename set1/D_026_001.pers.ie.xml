<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> Of the <rs n="Battle of Fredericksburg" type="battle">battle of Fredericksburg</rs> I will speak briefly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>They crossed the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> &mdash; ah, fatal crossing to them &mdash; and essayed to carry the heights.--But <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> was on the right, <persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName> protected the left, and <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> was in the centre.--The result was as might have been readily foreseen by every man of common sense.--The Federal army suffered a signal repulse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>The corpses of their dead and the bodies of their mangled and groaning dying ones covered the area in front of our lines at the <rs>Stonewall</rs> and on the lower end of the battle-field near <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Hamilton's Crossing</placeName>, whilst the good old town of <placeName reg="Coopers, Mercer, West Virginia" key="tgn,2255301">Fredericksburg</placeName> became for the nonce a dead hospital and a charnel house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The Federal cause, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time in the war, suffered a most humiliating defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Their hopes of conquest were crushed, and their vaunted boastings were turned into wittings over their great calamity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Many have criticised <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> very freely for not pushing the enemy on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>.

<head>The Finances of the <rs>New</rs> year.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/> The year which begins this day must witness a financial convulsion of very considerable magnitude in the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>Every man who observes public affairs, or knows anything about them, is convinced that some radical measure must be adopted by the <rs>Government</rs> for supplanting the present paper medium with another that will approximate more nearly the standard of gold, and thus avoid the enormous expenditures of a deprecated currency, and the ultimate repudiation of the war debt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>It is hardly probable that any measure for the revivification of the present paper issue at this time will be matured and agreed upon by Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>We are satisfied that any such measure will be futile if adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>The Government cannot bear the burthen of it. It cannot substitute a new currency and bolster up the present at the same time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>The crisis demands the most decisive remedies applied promptly and skillfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>The indebtedness incurred must be deferred until after the war, and a new and limited debt and a new currency must be put forth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>Nor must the <rs>Government</rs> incur too much debt in the way of interest at a time like this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>To do so would seriously cripple its means for the war, impair its power to meet its liabilities after the war, and thus impair its credit and the value of any currency or obligation it may issue. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/> In view of these considerations, it will be better for everybody to incur no obligations that can be avoided, and those that cannot be avoided should be made for as brief a time as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>Bonds given now should be regulated somewhat in amount by the probable exigencies and changes that may occur before next <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>It is certainly unwise for a man to engage in a bond to mature then at present prices for anything.--Let the people maintain their own credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>It is important to the <rs>Government</rs> itself that they should. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/> The currency is no unconquerable obstacle to our independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>It was not to the independence of our Fathers of <num value="76">76</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>It would be the will of all save traitors and misers that the whole of the present Confederate currency should be burned, if that were necessary to our triumphant defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>But it is not necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>If the <rs type="place">Government cuts</rs> deep, and, taking care of its high responsibilities at this time, defers entirely its debt already incurred till after the war, its measures of defence and resistance will be invigorated, and we shall go <hi rend="italics">through</hi> the coming year with increased energy and success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>The public confidence at home and abroad in our cause, and the amount of force we command to defend it, will be stronger than ever.--The country, seeing the necessity, is ready to acquiesce in the boldest means for accomplishing this object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>Everything is to be over by the <dateStruct value="-07-4"><day reg="4">fourth</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, and that auspicious day is to witness the &#x0022;old flag,&#x0022; the emblem of more disgrace than ever tarnished any standard the world ever saw, is to wave in triumph, gridiron, buzzard, and all, over the whole country from the <rs>Potomac</rs> to the <rs type="place">Rio Grande</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>what is comprehended and signified by those terms?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>Confiscation means to have no house to cover the head, no bed whereon to lie &mdash; to have nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>Subjugation means a negro guard in every house and a provost marshal at every cross- road, with no right to visit a neighbor, no right to visit the house of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, without a permit from a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">provost marshal</rs>, to be handed to a negro guard.&#x0022; </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>But the larger portion of them are disgracefully straggling or tarrying at home, and but too many of the people are harboring and encouraging them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>We hesitate not to say that we have <hi rend="italics">now</hi> on the muster roll not a man under half a <num value="1000000">million</num>, and this is all the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> expect to have when they shall have received their new recruits next spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>And yet, shameful as it is, we are bound to confess that we have scarcely ever met them in battle when they were not greatly our superior in numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>And it is all owing to the people of the country, who encourage straggling and deserting by harboring stragglers and deserters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>What do <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> the people mean?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>Are they not aware that they are imperilling the cause by harboring these men?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>Do they wish to be subjugated?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>Do they wish their property to be confiscated?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>Do they want a negro guard in their houses and negro sentinels at their gates?--Do they not see that when they harbor deserters they are bringing this state of things upon them? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/> But there is no use in remonstrating.--Congress is about to pass a severe law against harboring deserters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>We only wish it was even more severe, and we hope it will be faithfully executed. </p> </div3>
