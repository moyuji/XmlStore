<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The following is the result of my inquiries and investigation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>As I wrote you on <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct>, the enemy began to cross the <rs>Rapidan</rs> at <placeName reg="Ely's ford">Ely's</placeName> and <placeName reg="Germann's ford">Germann's fords</placeName> on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>On <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct>, the enemy having laid down pontoons across the <rs type="place">Rapidan rivers</rs> their whole force was busily engaged all day in crossing and about nightfall had succeeded in knowing across their whole force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> the enemy bivouacked in and near <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName>.

At the same time the force which crossed at <placeName reg="Germanna">Germanna</placeName> across and over the turnpike, as if intending to join the force which was moving on those <unclear></unclear>. In order to understand the situation, let us explain that <placeName reg="Orange, Orange, Virginia" key="tgn,7014299">Orange</placeName> C H is on the direct line or away from <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName> to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, distant from the former place about <measure n="78miles" type="distance">78 miles</measure>, and from the latter about <measure n="87miles" type="distance">87 miles</measure>. <placeName reg="Orange, Orange, Virginia" key="tgn,7014299">Orange</placeName> C H is also about <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure> south of the <rs type="place">Rapidan Railroad Bridge</rs>, and is the use of our supplies and the depot for our wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The battle-field is about <measure n="25miles" type="distance">twenty five miles</measure> below breast of <placeName reg="Orange, Orange, Virginia" key="tgn,7014299">Orange</placeName> C H, along the highways of the plank and turnpike roads which connect <placeName reg="Orange, Orange, Virginia" key="tgn,7014299">Orange</placeName> C H with <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The enemy having passed up the plank and turnpike roads, also severed across and seized the <name>Catharpin</name> and <name>Brock</name> made, which run nearly parallel with the plank and turnpike roads, and to the south of these. --Their object in thus acting is interpreted by some or meaning that they intended, had they not have been molested by <persName n="Lee,,Gen,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="default:Lee,Gen,,,"><foreName>Gen</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, to have moved forward towards <placeName reg="Malford Depot">Malford Depot</placeName>, and thus to have joined <persName n="Lee,,Gen,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="default:Lee,Gen,,,"><foreName>Gen</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s flank and caused him to fall back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The enemy not knowing that we had any breastworks, charged us, and were terribly cut to pieces. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The conduct of the brigade has been and doubtless will be much animadverted upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/> In order to live in <rs n="Natchez" type="nativeamerican">Natchez</rs> the freeman must not only be hired to some white person, but he must also live at the domicil of his employer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>He must be a servant, and he must live with his master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>Though he were hired, yet if he lived across the street from his employer, he must be driven from the city; and in the execution of the order, these were the points that special attention was given to. No regard was shown to character, to age, sex, or condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>The simple fact that a freedman was honestly supporting himself and family, was a sufficient reason for driving him from the city, except in some cases of back drivers, and draymen, and market men, whom <persName n="Kelley,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00267" reg="nearbymention:Kelley,Dr,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Kelley</surname></persName> excepted, as the city could hardly afford to lose them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>In the execution of the order there seemed to be no regard shown to the marriage or parental relations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>If the husband was employed by a white person, and happened to live at his domicil, he might reman, but his wife must leave the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>Or if the wife was so employed, and her husband laboring for himself, he must be driven away from his family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>And if the parents were employed, and their children working for the family or themselves, they must leave the place of their birth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>The marriage and parental relations were no more in the way or the execution of this order, than they were in the way of the execution of the order of the auctioneer in the slave market a year ago in this place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>Indeed, the days of slavery seemed to have returned again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>There was the yard or pen into which the colored people, driven from the different parts of the city by the soldiers, were placed &mdash; old men and women, some of whom had lived in the city <num value="40">forty</num> or <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure>, and boys and girls, and little children, to await the decision of the <rs>Doctor</rs>, or his subordinates, as to whether they shall be driven from their homes, and be separated forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>Some old citizens, living here for <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure>, say they never saw so much sorrow and distress in <rs n="Natchez" type="nativeamerican">Natchez</rs> as they saw on the <date value="04-01">1st day of April.</date>--Many of the freed people were heard to say they never had been so hardly treated by their masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>Whole families had lived together with their masters, but now they must be separated &mdash; some stay in the city, others be driven to the kraal, and from that to the plantation, to be again taken by the rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>Hence many who had <sic>had</sic> kind masters resolved to return to slavery rather than expose themselves to the unknown cruelties of lawless and prowling guerrillas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>The consequence is that so far as this class of persons is concerned the order of <persName n="Kelley,,Dr,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00268" reg="default:Kelley,Dr,,,"><foreName>Dr</foreName> <surname>Kelley</surname></persName>, approved and backed by the power of the <rs>Brigadier</rs>, has defeated the <rs>Emancipation Proclamation</rs> of the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/> Another sad effect of the execution of this order is that it has nearly broken up the free schools of the colored people in the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/> We give all the news that had transpired, touching the struggle for this city, up to the time of going to press. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/> In all the collisions between <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00342" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s immense column and the invincible army under <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00343" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, the advantage has been decidedly in our favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>We report a severe engagement between <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00344" reg="nearbymention:Longstreet,Gen,,,"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName> and the <num value="5" type="ordinal">5th</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName>, near <placeName reg="Spotsylvania Court House">Spotsylvania C.

Another dispatch from him announces that the enemy were again &#x0022;handsomely repulsed&#x0022; yesterday morning at the same place. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/> While we have every reason to believe <sic>tha</sic> <orgName n="army"><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00346" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, driven from field to field by our intrepid troops, must be to a great extent demoralized, yet a complete defeat is wanting to wind him up and send him to the <name>Hades</name> of all defeated <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>He will, possibly, if he is permitted, cross the river and put himself in connection with his supplies via the <rs>Potomac</rs> and <orgName n="Aquia Creek Railroad" type="railroad">Aquia <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs> Railroad</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>But if he does that, he must be regarded as so far a defeated man, that he has sought security in flight, and it will be long before he can sufficiently recover the spirits and discipline of his army to hazard further campaigning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>He might, however, in that event, plan a junction with <persName n="Smith,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00347" reg="nearbymention:Smith,Thos,,,"><surname>Smith</surname></persName> and <persName n="Gilmore,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00348" reg="mostcommon:Gilmore,nomatch:0"><surname>Gilmore</surname></persName>, either on the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> or the <rs>James</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/> These matters are so soon to be settled, that it is useless to speculate about them. --Let us hope that the redoubtable <rs>Grant</rs> will not imitate <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00349" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, by seeking safety in flight; but stand up like a man and triumph or fall gallantly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>The Southern army only asks the opportunity to try conclusions fairly and fight it out. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/> On the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName> the enemy seems inclined to press the amphibious part of the combined attack against <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00350" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> or no <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00351" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>He was making advances and skirmishing for positions yesterday, with what success our news columns will explain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>It is said that <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00352" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName> commands; and he has vanity and ambition enough to delude him into the idea that he may, after all, be the lucky man to take <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and thus become the most renowned individual in all the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>We trust, if he is really in command, that our soldiers are all aware of it. The fact would be worth a <num value="1000">thousand</num> men to us. If he would only expose himself enough to let our troops know where he is, it would add a good deal of spirit and animation to the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>It is said he was near being captured the other night; but we apprehend it was a mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>A man who wears a suit of mail would hardly venture where, peradventure, he might unluckily fall into Confederate hands! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/> The great struggle continues to be in our favor, and we shall in a few days, we hope and believe, be relieved from all anxiety; the combined movement having been defeated and driven off in despair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>Never had people higher motives for exerting all their strength and means in the defence; for it is not only a defence of all that is dear on earth, but the enemy has massed all his power for a final struggle against us. If we repel him now we demonstrate to him his hopeless undertaking, and he cannot again rally his men and resources for a like attempt. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/> The news brought to this city by the <rs>Baltimore</rs> papers of the <num value="5" type="ordinal">5th</num>, contain the proceedings of the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Congress of the <num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num> inst, in which appears the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sign of caving in by that body. &#x0022;A bill guaranteeing <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> Government to the <rs>Rebellious States</rs>,&#x0022; was on motion of <persName n="Davis,Mister,Henry,Winter,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00353" reg="default:Davis,Henry,Winter,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Henry</foreName> <foreName>Winter</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Md.</placeName>, so amended as to require a <hi rend="italics">majority</hi> of the voters of a seceded State, instead of &#x0022;<num value="1">one</num>-<num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num>,&#x0022; as in the original bill, to reorganize a State Government &mdash; and so as to allow those who have held &#x0022;merely instrumental offices under the <rs>Rebel Government</rs>, and those who have held inferior military offices in the rebel army, to participate in, and hold office under the reconstructed Government.&#x0022; After thus amending the bill, it appear that a ruthless preamble proposed by <persName n="Stevens,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00354" reg="mostcommon:Stevens,nomatch:0"><surname>Stevens</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, was rejected &mdash; This preamble declare &#x0022;that the so-called <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> are a public enemy, waging an unjust war, in which they are not entitled to the privileges and immunities of civilized warfare.&#x0022; After repudiating this sweeping preamble, the bill passed, <num value="78">78</num> to <num value="59">59</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/> This action of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Congress is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sign of concession from the unsparing policy which has heretofore marked its measures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>But this we conjecture is partly the result of the feud which has arisen between the <name>Lincolnites</name> and the other partisans of the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00355" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,A.,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> has been essaying to bring; several States, occupied by his troops, into the <rs>Union</rs>, with a view of getting their votes for himself as <rs type="role2">President</rs>; and his orders on the subject to his military representatives, provided that <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num>-<num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num></hi> of the voters of any State might proceed to re-organize the <rs>State Government</rs>, and bring it into the <rs>Union</rs>.--Anti Lincolnites have evidently determined to set their seal of condemnation upon this trick of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00356" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,A.,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, and deprive him of any benefit to be derived from it. Of course the peace, or <orgName n="Conservative party" type="party">conservative party</orgName>, aided them in their opposition, and they took no doubt an especial pleasure in voting down <persName n="Stevens,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00357" reg="mostcommon:Stevens,nomatch:0"><surname>Stevens</surname></persName>'s preamble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>It was quite an advantage gained to them. </p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/> A few months ago <placeName key="tgn,2044091" n="1.000 10" reg="Steven, Ouachita, Louisiana">Steven</placeName>'s preamble would have reflected the policy, as we doubt not it now reflects the sentiments, of the majority of the <orgName n="Federal Congress" type="congress">Federal Congress</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>But as they desire power, offices, and patronage, they hesitate not to take advantage of the embarrassments and military disasters of their own Government to advance their own party interests ! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/> These discords are encouraging to us, the more especially as we know that they are chiefly strengthened by the invincible courage and unflagging resistance of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>Yet we had rather their feuds would not lead to the exhibition of Clemency towards us. Let them continue their barbarous policy &mdash; their &#x0022;unconditional surrender&#x0022; ultimatum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>We assure them we are no better than we have been &mdash; that we hate them as much as ever &mdash; and infinitely prefer their hostility to their forgiveness, and the invasion of their armies to that of their traders, politicians, and philanthropists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>In short, we are so obdurate that we prefer anything <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> to a reunion with them and submission to their Government. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/> Yet, let us not be too much concerned about this bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>It may contain all that could be desired, such as confiscation, the appropriation of all Southern property to pay the war debt, and imposing the most humiliating regulations on our people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, however they may quarrel, when it comes to stealing and plundering, could hardly deny themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>Indeed, they may allow us some little semblances of freedom, of <num value="1">one</num> kind and another; but as to our property, it will go hard when it comes to the point that they must give up that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>As long as they can they must take that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>Their <name>Christian</name> feelings will not allow them to forego the opportunity of directing our aspirations to Heaven, by diminishing the ties that bled us to Earth! </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>It seems that the <hi rend="italics"><unclear>tum</unclear> fulmen</hi> of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Congress had not the effect to deter him from coming over to assume the crown of the new empire in <placeName reg="North America" key="tgn,1000001">North America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>The <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Monroe</placeName> doctrine is not <num value="1">one</num> of the articles of his faith, and the fear of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> is not <num value="1">one</num> of his political graces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>We shall see now what the <orgName n="Federal Congress" type="congress">Federal Congress</orgName> will do.--They did not hazard a great deal, it is true, in their resolution declaring their opposition to the establishment of a monarchy in <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> by <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> agency.--It was a mere declaration, backed by no measure to give it other than a moral force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>It may be inferred that it was a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> trick, employed with the hope that it might frighten <persName n="Maximilian,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00363" reg="mostcommon:Maximilian,nomatch:0"><surname>Maximilian</surname></persName>; and that failing in their purpose, why they will simply let the matter drop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>where, for <measure n="3hours" type="date">three hours</measure>, the musket and the bayonet encountered the sword and the shield in mortal combat; for on that dreadful day no man spared a foc--<hi rend="italics">we were too weak for mercy.</hi>&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/> In the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> history of the <rs n="Jewish" type="religion">Jewish</rs> people occur numerous examples and warnings of the dangers of false clemency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/><num value="1">One</num> of the most striking of these is the invasion of <placeName key="tgn,1000119" n="1.000 3" reg="yisra'el">Israel</placeName> by Benhadad, <rs type="role" reg="King">King</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1000140" n="1.000 36" reg="suriyah">Syria</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>This Benhadad seems to have been as arrogant and boastful as a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>, and far superior in military power to the invaded country.--Indeed, his immense force rendered the idea of opposition ridiculous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>The message he sent to the <rs>King</rs> of <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName>, when he came before <placeName reg="Samaria, Putnam, Tennessee" key="tgn,2639826">Samaria</placeName>, was as audacious as the manifestoes of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00367" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,A.,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and his <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>: &#x0022;Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives, also, and thy children, even the goodliest, are mine. &#x0022; The <rs>Israelite King</rs>, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> appalled by the odds against him, returned an answer which only had the effect of increasing the truculence of Benhadad, who replied that he would reduce <placeName reg="Samaria, Putnam, Tennessee" key="tgn,2639826">Samaria</placeName> to dust, which would then not suffice to give handfuls to all the men of his numerous host.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>Roused to the exigency by such a message, the <rs>King</rs> of <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName> sent back this royal answer, not unworthy the consideration of the <name>Benhadad</name> now threatening with equal arrogance the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>: &#x0022;Tell him, let not him that girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off&#x0022; Then, in obedience to the prophet of the <rs>Lord</rs>, the <name>Israelites</name> fell upon the invaders, and though they numbered little more than <num value="7000">seven thousand</num> men, the vast multitude of the <rs n="Syrian" type="ethnic">Syrian</rs> army was swept away like dust before a whirlwind, the arrogant <rs>Benhadad</rs> being the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in the flight. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/> But this was not the last of it. A <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> stupendous invasion was prepared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>The <rs>King</rs> of <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName>, forewarned of its approach, though his utmost preparations bore no comparison to the <rs n="Syrian" type="ethnic">Syrian</rs> power, resolved that he would not again be shut up in <placeName reg="Samaria, Putnam, Tennessee" key="tgn,2639826">Samaria</placeName>, but that the contest should be in the open country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>The <orgName>army of <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName></orgName>, in front of its colossal opponent, is described by the sacred historian as looking &#x0022;like <num value="2">two</num> little flocks of kids.&#x0022; But the battle is not always to the strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>Again, through the might of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, the <name>Israelites</name> were not only victorious, but achieved a great, crushing, decisive victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>Benhadad himself sought shelter in a position from which, however, he knew there was no chance of escape. --<name n="God" type="God">God</name> had given him and his whole army into the hands of the <rs>King</rs> of <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>But mark how even a great virtue, like humanity, may be so misplaced in the time and object of its exercise, as to paralyze the wise benevolence of Heaven. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/> Benhadad had no hope but in throwing himself upon the clemency of the <rs>King</rs> of <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>His counsellors assured him that they had heard the <rs>Kings</rs> of <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName> were merciful men. He accordingly sent ambassadors to beg the <rs n="Syrian" type="ethnic">Syrian</rs> <persName n="King,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00368" reg="mostcommon:King,nomatch:0"><surname>King</surname></persName>'s life, but to note the manner in which the application was received, and to frame their demeanor accordingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>Clothing themselves in sack-cloth, and with ropes about their necks &mdash; customs of those days by which such suppliants intended to express that their fate was in the hands of him before whom they appeared &mdash; they thus addressed the <rs>King</rs> of <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName>: &#x0022;Thy servant Benhadad saith, I pray thee, let me live.&#x0022; By the universal practice of that age, by all the dictates of sound policy, the captive monarch had no right to expect aught but death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>If <persName><foreName>David</foreName></persName> had been the <rs>King</rs> he would never have delivered him that without cause was his enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>But the <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> then reigning monarch was moved to commiseration at the change of fortune in <num value="1">one</num> whose blasphemy against <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and malignity against his people deserved the most exemplary punishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>Yielding to a sentiment which, under ordinary circumstances, would have been commendable, he replied to the ambassadors: &#x0022;Is he yet alive?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>He is my brother.&#x0022; Catching at the word, the keen ambassadors replies: &#x0022;Thy <persName><roleName n="Brother">brother</roleName> <foreName>Benhadad</foreName></persName> liveth.&#x0022; On this the <rs>King</rs> of <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName> desired him to be called, took him up into his charlot, and restored him to liberty on his own terms, thus flying in the face of the <rs>Divine Benefactor</rs> who had appointed Benhadad to &#x0022;utter destruction,&#x0022; and who had placed in the hands of <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName> the means of accomplishing that end. And what was the result?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>A few years after the <rs>King</rs> of <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName> met his own death in battle with the very <rs>King</rs> he had saved, and &#x0022;under the express orders of Benhadad to his soldiers to aim their weapons exclusively against the life of the man who had spared his own.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/> &#x0022;Suppose,&#x0022; says a theological writer of that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> whose humane sentiments we fear to offend by retaliating for the dreadful barbarities of the enemy--&#x0022;suppose that after the <rs n="Battle of Waterloo" type="battle">battle of Waterloo</rs>, when the great trouble of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> was brought a prisoner to our shores, the <name>Regent</name> had behaved like the <rs>King</rs> of <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName> to Benhadad, in setting <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00369" reg="nearbymention:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>No doubt, some sentimentalist would have applauded his &#x0027;magnanimity&#x0027; towards the greatest enemy his country had ever known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>But <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> would have mourned his &#x0027;weakness;&#x0027; and his people would have execrated it, if, as is likely, instead of the longest peace known in their history, the subsequent years of <placeName key="tgn,2080924;tgn,2165488;tgn,2007681" n="0.142 000000.9915	placename;tgn,2080924;napoleon, henry, ohio,Henry,Ohio,United States,North and Central America;0.028 000000.1983	placename;tgn,2165488;Beulah Island Landing, Desha, Arkansas,Desha,Arkansas,United States,North and Central America;0.028 000000.1983	placename;tgn,2007681;Napoleon, Independence, Arkansas,Independence,Arkansas,United States,North and Central America" reg="napoleon, henry, ohio,Henry,Ohio,United States,North and Central America;Beulah Island Landing, Desha, Arkansas,Desha,Arkansas,United States,North and Central America;Napoleon, Independence, Arkansas,Independence,Arkansas,United States,North and Central America">Napoleon</placeName>'s life had been marked with trouble, confusion, distress, warfare, rapine and blood; and the <name>Regent</name> would doubtless have experienced from <persName n="Bonaparte,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00370" reg="mostcommon:Bonaparte,nomatch:0"><surname>Bonaparte</surname></persName> gratitude of the same quality as that which the <rs>King</rs> of <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName> received from the hands of the <rs>King</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1000140" n="1.000 36" reg="suriyah">Syria</placeName>&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/> At this age of the world no man would visit a captive enemy with the punishment of death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>But at this and every other age of the world, savages, who violate all the laws of war, must be paid in their own coin, or there is an end to public security.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>Humanity is a noble creature, but if we abate <num value="1">one</num> hair's brendth of the treatment to our enemies which they visit upon our friends, our humanity to our enemies becomes the worst kind of inhumanity to ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> has given us great victories, but whilst we spare the lives of captives we should hold them to the strictest accountability for the usage meted out by their Government to our friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>Thus far the clemency they have received has only emboldened them, like Benhadad, to fresh acts of crime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>Fear is the only motive by which they can be restrained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>If to-morrow they could capture our heroic and noble <rs type="role2">President</rs> they would put him to death at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>They would slaughter his whole Cabinet by his side, as indeed <persName n="Dahlgren,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00371" reg="mostcommon:Dahlgren,nomatch:0"><surname>Dahlgren</surname></persName> carried positive instructions for doing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>What consideration, what common courtesy even; do we owe to such savages?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>If we had carried on the war from the beginning upon the most rigid principle of retaliation, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> barbarians would long since have slunk back to their dens and caves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>It is not too late now to learn a lesson from history, and from our own experience. </p> </div3>
