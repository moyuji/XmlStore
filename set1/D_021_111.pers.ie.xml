<head>Exile.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> Some of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> journalists speak of exile as the very mildest punishment that can be inflicted upon the <rs>Southern</rs> leaders of &#x0022;the rebellion.&#x0022; As soon as the country is conquered, which they take it for granted will be accomplished whenever our cities fall into their hands, they are going to compel our leaders to fly the country forever. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> That achievement, our subjugation, is not so near as their imaginative geniuses suppose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Our cities are but drops in the bucket of the <rs>Southern</rs> population and power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>But, should the sad event of subjugation come, the exile they threaten will be the only blessing that earth has left for the oppressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>There are other lands, some of them free and attractive, where the oppressed can find a refuge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Bitter as is the pang of giving up <num value="1">one</num>'s country, when that country ceases to be our own, the sacrifice has been already made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>It remains only then to pass life in looking forever upon the face of the loved and lost, as death changes every semblance of the thing that was dear to us, or to tear ourselves away, and seek in time and distance some opiate to the wounded soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Alas, there are few who can find this relief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>It is only those who have wealth who can remove their household gods and depart to a far country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>For the mass, they can only have hope in that abiding city beyond the grave, where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The sentiment of patriotism is <num value="1">one</num> which was recognized even by the <rs>Divide Saviour</rs> of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>He wept over the woes that came upon His native land, and poured forth His sympathies with its sorrows in words of sublime and soul subduing pathos.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Would to Heaven that, if we must be subjugated, there could be a universal exodus of the <rs>Southern</rs> people to some land of liberty and law, where each man could rest secure under his own vine and fig tree, and never look upon the hated faces of our oppressors more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>But this cannot be. There is no hope for us on earth but in resistance &mdash; resistance at all hazards and to the last extremity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>And in such resistance there is not only hope, but the certainty of ultimate independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>No nation like the <rs>South</rs> ever was conquered that was true to itself, and determined to be free. </p> </div3>

<head><rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> letter writers.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> letter writers, by their ingenious fictions, have supplied in great part the literary and moral nutriment with which they used to furnish the world in their yellow covers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>We get nothing now in this latitude of that Satanic literature, but its place is more than made up by the letters written from the <rs>South</rs> to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> newspapers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>The false-hoods they utter have long since ceased to excite any emotion, but wonder at their transcendent genius for audacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>Standing in no fear of contradiction, they pour out a freshet of lies exceeding in volume and immensity the combined currents of the <rs>Nile</rs> and <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>The last we have seen was beautiful in its mendacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>It was a letter from the army near <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, in which the writer said that Union flags were displayed by the citizens in all directions, and that the ladies vied with each other in attention to the sick <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> soldiers, sending them all sorts of delicacies, and, among them, lemons, freshly plucked from the trees!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>A lady friend expresses her surprise, that they did not add oranges, and other tropical delicacies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Why not mention bananas and plantains?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>We have no doubt that the <orgName n="Union Flag" type="newspaper">Union flag</orgName> was displayed on lemon branches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Oh, <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>! <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>!--There is a certain book that says all <q>&#x0022;liars shall be cast into a lake that burneth with fire and brimstone.&#x0022;</q> What, then, will you do for lemons and oranges? </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="3"> 
<head>The gunboats.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have contrived to make their miserable gunboats loom up in the people's imagination to the dimensions of <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> devils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>If we suffer them to impose this new humbug upon our credulity, we shall be whipped wherever a gunboat can penetrate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>We shall fly from them as soon as we see the smoke of <num value="1">one</num> of their chimneys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>But the truth is, that, in comparison with land batteries properly constructed, they ought not to excite any apprehension.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>Especially upon narrow streams, properly fortified, a gunboat ought to be sunk without the slightest difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>In the attack upon <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee">Fort Donelson</placeName> even iron clad gunboats were shivered to pieces by the heavy batteries of the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>In the narrow portions of the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName> a land battery ought to be able to knock a gunboat out of the water, whilst riflemen in the woods could pick off with ease every man upon her decks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>We hope the time is at hand when, for the credit of Southern gunnery and the good of the <rs>Southern</rs> cause, this whole gunboat humbug will be literally and thoroughly exploded. </p> </div3>

<head>Burning cotton.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/> This is the relieving feature in the disaster at New Orleans, that the <hi rend="italics">cotton was burned.</hi> The vast amount of cotton that the enemy expected to obtain in that greatest of Southern marts has disappeared like fog from the mountain side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>Not only is this the case, but we are assured that wherever they traverse the <rs>Southern</rs> rivers, and whatever Southern cities and towns they may take, the torch will be before them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>The cotton, we learn, is all removed from exposed places, and where it cannot be so removed, the firebrand is ready, and is in hands that are determined to use it.--They went to war for the cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>Let us see how much they will get of it. They might have an army of a <num value="1000000">million</num> or <num value="2000000">two millions</num>, instead of half a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men, but all the <num value="1000000">millions</num> in the world could not give them the cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>Not only is it the present crop that they cannot get, but they will get no other crops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>The planters of the <rs>South</rs> are universally abandoning the culture of cotton this year, and raising food for man and beast.--They will continue to do so, and raise no more cotton till they can raise it for themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>If the <rs>British</rs> can do without cotton, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> cannot, and in that inevitable certainty lies their doom and punishment. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>He thought Congress had the right to free the slaves of all rebels, and if it adjourned without putting such a law on the statute book, he believed they would be false and recreant to their country.

<head>A review of the <name>Various</name> confiscation bills proposed.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/> <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> <placeName reg="Morrill, Waldo, Maine" key="tgn,2045186">Morrill (Me.)</placeName> said he proposed in a few words to attempt to analyze some of the proposed measures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>Some of the bills, like those of the <rs>Senators</rs> from New York and <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, are bills meant to effect something and to touch the rebellion, and are produced by men who mean to crush the rebellion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/> The other bills are a class not intended to effect anything, and are produced by men who do not mean to do anything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>The bill before the <name>Senate</name> was calculated to strike directly at the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>The bill simply authorizes the <rs>President</rs> to seize such an amount of property as he deems that military necessity requires for the safety and welfare of the <name>United Sates</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>Does anybody oppose this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>This is to be done, not for the purpose of emancipation, but for the suppression of the rebellion.--Who opposes that? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/> This bill is effective, and is designed for the present state of affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>The policy of the other bills is to do nothing to put down the rebellion, but somehow, after the rebellion is put down, to turn the nation into a <orgName n="Criminal Court" type="court">criminal court</orgName> for punishment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>This bill simply forfeits the property of a certain class of persons and the forfeiture is to be enforced by the <rs>President</rs> only in the prosecution of the war and the suppression of the rebellion, and when it is suppressed, all power under the bill is at an end. But the substitute offered by the <rs>Senator</rs> from <placeName reg="Vermont" key="tgn,7007828">Vermont</placeName> provides for the punishment for treason of every person who has taken up arms against the <rs>Government</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/> Then it provides that the person so convicted shall be for ever disqualified from holding office, and then superadds the penalty that the slaves of such persons shall be freed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>The provisions of this substitute are much more sweeping than those of the bill reported from the <rs>Committee</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>The <rs>Senator</rs> from <placeName reg="Vermont" key="tgn,7007828">Vermont</placeName> in his speech declared that we had no right to interfere with slavery, yet his bill authorizes the <rs>President</rs> arbitrarily to free every slave in the country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/> He then referred to the substitute offered by the <rs>Senator</rs> from <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> <persName n="Cowan,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00040" reg="mostcommon:Cowan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Cowan</surname></persName> and contended that it was more sweeping than any other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>But, the fact was that these other bills are not intended to do anything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>Congress, the great war council of the nation, ought to have the manliness to take the responsibility and advise and counsel the <rs>President</rs>, and not throw any responsibility on him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>He did not believe that the passage of the bill would especially inflame the rebels or strengthen the friends of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>He was in favor of some confiscation act, but he could not say that he favored this act, for he had not had time to examine it. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>He said there were many <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> whose chief object was to destroy slavery, no matter what else was done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>He contended at some length that the true </p> <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/> policy of confiscation was to devote the property according to his proposed amendment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/> He denied that slavery was the cause of the war. He contended at some length that in fact the free States were responsible for the war of <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>, the war of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, and the repeal of the <rs>Missouri Compromise</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>If the free States had not brought slavery into Congress, we should not have had the present trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>The people of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> had developed the mind to a great extent, but they were so smart and conceited as to think they can manage everybody's business, and, therefore, they were meddlers, and continually poking their noses into other people's bucket of swill. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/> He referred to the pledges of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName>, and said that if they passed this bill they would array the whole Southern people against the law. He was willing that slavery should take its chances of war, and willing that slaves should be confiscated like other property; but if the <name>Senate</name> intended to make war on slavery, then there will be only another war begun. </p>

<head>The Governor's Message.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/> This is a document worthy of the best days of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>The Governor deals with all the prominent topics of the day in a manly straightforward style, that does credit to his intelligence and moral courage. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/> <persName n="Letcher,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00050" reg="mostcommon:Letcher,John,,,:4"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Letcher</surname></persName> believes the <name>Conscription</name> law to be unconstitutional But this, he tells us, is no time to disturb it. All we have to think of now is the best way to best the enemy; and since this appears the best way, we must submit for the present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>Drive off the enemy <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and then let us think of repealing the law and securing the rights of the <name>States</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/> The Governor is not at all cast down by our late reverses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>On the contrary, he says they ought to stimulate us to renewed exertions.--We are happy in the belief that they have already produced that effect in a very remarkable degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>He is well assured that no nation, determined to be free, can ever be subjugated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>He refers to the trials of our revolutionary fathers, and to the fact that in the commencement of their struggle they were far less cheered by successes than we have been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>We have no compromises to make with <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00051" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s Government, which is an absolute despotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>We must establish a pure and genuine Republic, which shall preserve our liberty and protect us in the enjoyment of our rights. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/> <persName n="Letcher,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00052" reg="mostcommon:Letcher,John,,,:4"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Letcher</surname></persName> thinks we ought to make this a war of invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>All sensible menages with him there, we believe; and there are few who do not regret that it did not assume that character in the beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>The Governor thinks it not too late even now. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/> Judicious rules for the protection of slave property ought to be adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>The mate slave should be withdrawn with the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>where their labor is needed, and the females and children alone left behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/><persName n="Letcher,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00053" reg="mostcommon:Letcher,John,,,:4"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Letcher</surname></persName> thinks the enemy will not encumber himself with these latter, since they can do very little labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>The loss to the citizens of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> in the single item of slave property, far exceed the losses of all the other States in the article of cotton A district of country containing <num value="80000">80,000</num> slaves, valued at <measure n="13000000dollars" type="currency">$13,000,000</measure>, has already been overrun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>We hope the <rs>Governor</rs>'s recommendation of legislation on this subject will be immediately attended to. He says if our officers would notify owners to remove their slaves, when a position is to be abandoned, or report them at camp for service, it would have a beneficial effect. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/> The Governor calls particular attention to the vast deposits of saltpetre, sulphur and iron scattered throughout the <rs>State</rs>, and calls for legislative action to assist in developing then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>The wisdom of the men of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> revolution has left but little of an original character to be done in this particular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>It is only necessary to study their legislation on the subject, and to imitate it. They were thoroughly acquainted with the resources of the <rs>State</rs> so far as they were then developed, and their legislation was wise and deserving of close attention. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/> Our railways and their machinery are worthy of deep attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>The best rail, according to an English calculation, does not last more than <measure n="12years" type="date">twelve years</measure>. All our iron is at least <measure n="8years" type="date">eight years</measure> old and we have not labor or skill to furnish new. The utmost care is necessary to keep our roads from becoming useless, through the destruction of the rail.--The Governor recommends a good deal of legislation on this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>The rate of speed ought to be reduced to <measure n="10miles" type="distance">ten miles</measure> an hour, and no freight ought to be carried on passenger trains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>He is down on the <rs>Express</rs> trains for carrying heavy freight at passenger speed.--He thinks it ought not to be allowed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/> The militia laws come next under review.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>The Governor condemns, in pointed farms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>the gross abuser existing under the exemption laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>From the reports made to the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant General</rs>, it appears that applicants for exemption are allowed to select their physicians and the court houses have been <unclear>quenti</unclear> thronged by physicians, receiving fees for certificates of &#x0022;disability.&#x0022; Be insists upon it that all men <hi rend="italics">capable</hi> of bearing arms ought to be made to do it in such times as these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>A disinterested physician ought to be appointed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/> The Governor speak with exultation of the rejection of the <rs>Constitution</rs> made by the traitors Convention in <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961"><rs type="direction">North</rs> western Virginia</placeName>, by the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>As that made by our own Convention has also been rejected, <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> is still united, <num value="1">one</num> and indivisible, under her old Constitution. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/> The easy surrender of New Orleans has inspired the New York journals with the pleasing conviction that the capture of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 8" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> is a matter to be accomplished with equal case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>They will be undeceived whenever they make the attempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>No Southern position capable of defence has yet fallen into their hands except through rank treason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>There is no more chance for treason now that our eyes are open.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>If they get <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 8" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, it will be through case of blood.
