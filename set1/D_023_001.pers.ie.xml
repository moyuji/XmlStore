<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>The intelligent reader will understand, and perhaps appreciate, the difficulties attending an accurate compilation of all the incidents connected with the operations of the armies around <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> for the past <measure n="5days" type="date">five days</measure>. It is almost impossible to afford in detail descriptions of the several engagements which have shed such imperishable lustre upon the arms of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and which have finally resulted in the overthrow, complete and disgraceful, of the hosts marshaled under the banner of subjugation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> Of the important results which must inevitably flow from our successes, and the discomfiture of the <rs>Northern</rs> army under <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,George,B.,,:3"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, it is needless at this time to speculate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Suffice it to say that from the opening of the grand ball on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time> down to the hour which witnessed the enemy in full retreat, the efforts of our forces were attended with unbroken success, and at no time did the brave men upon whom hung the hopes and the confidence of the country, falter or waver in their determination to make the victory decisive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Battery after battery was stormed with the most daring disregard of human life, and the apparently impregnable positions of the enemy were carried at the point of the bayonet with the most impetuous ardor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Never did men fight more bravely, and never was valor more surely and signally rewarded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> Our loss is heavy, both in officers and men. The soil of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, the grand old mother of States is enriched with the best blood of her suffering Southern sisters, and from every State of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> the martyrs of liberty have united in pouring out the crimson tide as a rich and imperishable libation upon the altar of the <num value="1">one</num> great common cause.--There is no discrimination to be made between the gallant men who constitute the most magnificent army that was ever arrayed in combat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>As sons of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> they fought, and as sons of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> they conquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>If <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 1">one corps</orgName> distinguished itself more than another in this, the greatest battle ever fought on this continent, it was on account of its position on the field. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> Our reports thus far published are up to <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time>. <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> skirmishing began at an early hour and continued through the day at different points along the line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The great battle of the day, however, took place in the evening near the <orgName n="York River Railroad" type="railroad">York River railroad</orgName>, some <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> from the battle field of the <q>&#x0022;<placeName reg="Seven Pines, Marion, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119933">Seven Pines</placeName>.&#x0022;</q> <persName n="Magruder,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Magruder,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Magruder</surname></persName> conmmenced the attack about <time value="4oclock">four o'clock</time>, by advancing upon the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> entrenchments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line was taken after a sharp conflict and the enemy driven to another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Waiting only long enough to get the artillery in position this also was stormed, and so on until <num value="7">seven</num> forts had been occupied, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> fleeing from each in wild confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The firing continued until <time value="10oclock">10 o'clock</time> in the night, when the battle ceased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>In this brilliant fight the men of <orgName n="division"><persName n="Magruder,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="nearbymention:Magruder,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Magruder</surname></persName>'s division</orgName> won great honor and maintained the fighting reputation given them on the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> fought desperately and contested the ground closely, but they could not stand the fierce charges made upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The loss was heavy to the enemy, <num value="175">one hundred and seventy-five</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were laid dead upon the field, and <measure n="800" type="prisoners">eight hundred prisoners</measure> were taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Our loss was not heavy, although many a good man was injured. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The advance of our men upon the enemy is described by an eye-witness as exciting in the extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>From <num value="1">one</num> fortification to another they rushed with an impetuosity that could not be checked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>In their advance several magazines were exploded and an immense quantity of stores destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Arms, baggage, overcoats, knapsacks, caps, and <unclear>h cks,</unclear> were scattered along the route in profusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The latest accounts of yesterday represent the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army cut in twain and trying to escape towards the <rs>James</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>After destroying the railroad and telegraph lines and driving the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> this side the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> also crossed and is now pressing hard upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Yesterday it was said that Generals Long street and <persName n="Hill,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Hill,James,H.,,:1"><surname>Hill</surname></persName> were in position in <placeName reg="Charles City, Charles City, Virginia" key="tgn,2111055">Charles City</placeName>, and that the last avenue of escape for the <q>&#x0022;grand army&#x0022;</q> is cut off. <persName n="Magruder,,Gen,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="default:Magruder,Gen,,,"><foreName>Gen</foreName> <surname>Magruder</surname></persName> had gone down to reinforce <persName n="Longstreet,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Longstreet</surname></persName> to assist in checking the retreat, while <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> and others are steadily driving them on. The only alternative is a heavy fight <unclear></unclear> the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName> or an unconditional surrender of <orgName n="army"><persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,George,B.,,:3"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> While <persName n="Magruder,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="nearbymention:Magruder,Gen,,,"><surname>Magruder</surname></persName> was thus successfully <q>&#x0022;pushing the enemy to the wall&#x0022;</q> on the south side of the <name>Chickabominy</name>, the redoubtable <rs>Stuart</rs> was not less successful in frustrating the plans of the young <rs>Napoleon</rs> on the north side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Dashing down to the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName>, on the <rs>Pamunkey</rs>, he succeeded in bagging about <num value="2500">2,500</num> of the grand Union army at that point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>A number of these were brought to the city during the day yesterday, and the others we understand, are on route hither.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Of this number, there is a large sprinkling of the foreign element, representatives some of them of the <q>&#x0022;<placeName reg="Green Isle, Keweenaw, Michigan" key="tgn,2363735">Green Isle</placeName> of Erin,&#x0022;</q> and' others of the <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> <q>&#x0022;Faderland.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head>Operations yesterday.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> Of operations yesterday there is little to be said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>They were not destitute of importance, however and their results were of a serious nature to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The <q>&#x0022;folds of the anaconda are tightening around him.&#x0022;</q> and it is very evident that the <q>&#x0022;backbone&#x0022;</q> of the rebellion has been greatly strengthened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>There was some fighting, it is true, resulting more from efforts of the foe to cover his retreat than from any concerted plan for a regular fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>We think it will require greater genius than even <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,George,B.,,:3"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> possesses to relieve the invading force from its present unpleasant predicament. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> Our troops are still pressing upon the retreating foe, who seems to be effectually demoralized, espcially those constituting the rear of the army.--They are to be seen wandering in every direction through the dense woods near, the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, without guns or knapsacks, and many of them without hats, which indicates a thorough state of confusion among them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>As an evidence of this we may state the fact that <persName n="Carpenter,Doctor,Thomas,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="default:Carpenter,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>Thomas</foreName> <surname>Carpenter</surname></persName> and <num value="2">two</num> companions succeeded in gathering up upwards of <num value="50">fifty</num>, who, without any organization, were wandering about in apparent bewilderment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Other parties were similarly captured, and during the day small squads of a dozen or more were continually arriving in the city. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> During the day, a portion of the cavalry of <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> captured and destroyed several transports on the <placeName key="tgn,7017624" n="1.000 27" reg="pamunkey, virginia, united states">Pamunkey river</placeName> near <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Thus are the means of escape for the enemy being cut off; so that, in any view of the case, there seems to be little probability of their getting off in force. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> Early in the day it was stated, with some degree of plausibility, that the forces of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> had succeeded in bagging some <num value="4500">forty-five hundred</num> of the enemy; and although we have no positive confirmation of the statement, we are inclined to think it correct in the main.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Certain it is, that the vigilance of that distinguished officer, as manifested in his Valley campaign, has not been in the least relaxed in his operations on the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>It is highly probable that a portion of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army may succeed in effecting an escape, but a very large portion of it must fall into our hands: </p>
