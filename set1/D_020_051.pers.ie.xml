<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/> I must <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> say, however, that though this is termed <orgName n="regiment"><persName n="McDonald,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00097" reg="mostcommon:McDonald,nomatch:0"><surname>McDonald</surname></persName>'s regiment</orgName>, the justly celebrated and distinguished <persName n="Ashby,,Turner,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00098" reg="default:Ashby,Turner,,,"><foreName>Turner</foreName> <surname>Ashby</surname></persName>, the <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieut.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/> The regiment is composed of the very bent material &mdash; of young men of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> order of intellect &mdash; the sons of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>'s <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and noblest citizens &mdash; brave and gallant to a letter.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/> On last Saturday a detachment of this regiment, under the command of <persName n="Ashby,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00100" reg="nearbymention:Ashby,Turner,,,"><surname>Ashby</surname></persName>, left <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> about <time value="2oclock">2 o'clock</time>, and took the road leading to <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>There were in all, I presume, some <num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num> men. being a private in the ranks, I, of course, knew not to what point we were to march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>Many were the conjectures that were made, but all seemed to concur in the belief that we were going to the <rs type="place">Ferry</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>At night we encamped at this place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>Early the next morning, (<dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>,) we were again put upon the march, taking, as we did the morning before, the road leading to the <rs type="place">Ferry</rs>.--We were now satisfied that we were going there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>Nothing could have pleased the pays better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>The probability of a brush with the enemy seemed to act them frantic with delight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>Looking around upon my comrades in arms, I beheld the light of battle beaming in every countenance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>The joy of a meeting with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> seemed already to purpose every <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>We steadily continued on our march, giving no head to the <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> eager advisers we met by the way, who warned us not to go to the <rs type="place">Ferry</rs>; that there were &#x0022;masked batteries&#x0022; at this and that place, and that if we did venture into the town we would certainly be all destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>Nothing, however, could daunt the intrepid <rs>Ashby</rs>, or turn him from his predetermined course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>He knew the men he commanded &mdash; at least a portion of them &mdash; and knew them to be brave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>They had fought by his side on <placeName reg="Kellys Island, Tennessee, United States" key="tgn,2433998">Kelley's Island</placeName>, and he well knew they would fight with him again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>With the courage of the &#x0022;Mountain Rangers, &#x0022; the corps he long commanded, he was thoroughly acquainted; and with them by his side he felt sure of success, let him encounter any odds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>Fortunately for us, perhaps, we marched into the town without encountering anything whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>There was not a single Federal soldier to be seen on this side of the river.--We soon discovered, however, several on the opposite shore, where it was reported they had a battery of <num value="1">one</num> gun. This we did not believe, from the fact that they would have opened fire upon us as we marched into town, if the gun, as reported, had been there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>We soon commenced a diligent search in town for any straggling soldiers that might have been left there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>Not succeeding in finding any, we ventured down to the river, where we had the pleasure of exchanging shots with the <rs>Federals</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>The distance fired was considerable, yet we are confident of having killed or crippled some <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>The only damage done us was a horse shot in the leg. A Lieutenant in the <rs>Shenandoah Rangers</rs> was riding him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/> The firing continued tolerably brisk for some time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>The distance being so great, however, there was little execution done on either side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>We remained several hours in the town, and then march I back to this place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>Though we had no fighting of any consequence, yet I conceive our march into <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> remarkable for daring and boldness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>We knew not but that the town was full of Federal soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>We were certain that on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time> there were <num value="6">six</num> companies there, and we supposed they were there still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>We were also confident they had a battery on the <rs type="place">Maryland heights</rs>, and felt sure they would open upon us. Yet, in the face of all this, about <num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num> gallant and brave boys, in broad daytime, marched into the streets of the town, and ventured far enough even to fire at them on the other side, killing or wounding several.--We have the pleasure to know that we were the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Southern soldiers to venture into the place after its evacuation by <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00101" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/> Since <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, we have been scouting this entire country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>I am confident there is not now a Federal soldier on this side the <rs>Potomac</rs> about here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>They sometimes venture over in the night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>A mill near <placeName reg="Georgetown, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2347734">Shepherdstown</placeName> was burned some nights ago, and last night they destroyed a mill at <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>We anticipate some rare sport in a few days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>Of our further movements, I shall be pleased to inform you. </p> <closer> <signed>A Soldier.</signed> </closer> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/> As much uncertainty prevails about the safe arrival of articles sent by the railroads to soldiers in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, would it not be a good plan to appoint some certain day for boxes or packages to be put aboard the freight trains at the various depots, and let some person travel throughout the line at such times for the purpose of attending to this matter alone?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>As it is, our <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> roads pass all such articles free of charge, but the <rs>Virginia</rs> reads do not; hence when packages reach <placeName reg="Weldon, Halifax, North Carolina" key="tgn,2077124">Weldon</placeName>, there is no <num value="1">one</num> on hand to pay freight, or attend thereto in forwarding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/> The <rs>Lieutenant</rs> proceeded immediately with the specified number of men, (detailed without regard to choice on his part,) from the several companies of the regiment, and on the <rs>Braddock</rs>'s road stationed <num value="8">eight</num> (<num value="8">8</num>) men; at <persName n="Turner,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00103" reg="mostcommon:Turner,nomatch:0"><surname>Turner</surname></persName>'s station, on the <orgName n="Orange and Alexandria Railroad" type="railroad">Orange and Alexandria Railroad</orgName>, <num value="4">four</num>; and on the <placeName key="tgn,1134243" n="1.000 1" reg="pohick creek, fairfax, virginia">Pohick</placeName> road, <num value="8">eight</num> more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>It turned out, however, that these flying <num value="15">fifteen</num> were only a small detachment of a large body of cavalry that were but a little distance off; and in a short time, they having joined the main body, the whole of them, amounting to <num value="75">seventy-five</num>, returned towards our men. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/>The city was considerably excited yesterday by a report that the expedition which sailed southward from <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> last, under command of <persName n="Butler,General,B.,F.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00278" reg="default:Butler,B.,F.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName>, had attacked and captured <placeName reg="Fort Hatteras">Fort Hatteras</placeName>, on the <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/>The authority for this report was the subjoined statement in the columns of the <orgName n="Petersburg Express" type="newspaper">Petersburg Express</orgName>, of yesterday: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/> We learn from a source every way reliable that at an early hour <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> it became evident to the small Confederate force stationed at <placeName reg="Fort Hatteras">Fort Hatteras</placeName>, on the coast of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, that the fleet, which was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> discovered off <placeName key="tgn,3000601" n="1.000 10" reg="cape hatteras, dare, north carolina">Hatteras</placeName> <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time>, contemplated an attack at that point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/>About <time value="9:30oclock">half-past 9 o'clock</time> the powerful vessels opened fire on the <rs>Fort</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>The fire was vigorously returned, but after <num value="20">twenty</num> rounds from the <rs>Fort</rs> the ammunition became exhausted, and the entire garrison, under command of <persName n="Barron,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00279" reg="mostcommon:Barron,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Barron</surname></persName>, late of the <orgName n="U.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/> We have been unable to learn the loss of life, if any. Had ammunition been abundant, it is scarcely probable that the <rs>Confederates</rs> could have maintained their position against a fleet which combined <num value="100">100</num> powerful guns, and a fighting force of <num value="4000">4,000</num> men. The garrison, we hear, consisted of but <num value="830">830</num> men, not all of whom, it is thought, were fit for duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>It is stated that when the ammunition became exhausted, the men sallied out to the beach and with their muskets made every effort to prevent the <rs n="Hessian" type="ethnic">Hessians</rs> from landing, but the war steamers immediately poured into their midst such a shower of shell, that they were forced to take shelter behind the fort. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>The fort was erected but a few months since, and it is not presumed that it is of a very formidable character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>It was built for only <num value="20">20</num> guns, and it is not believed that all of this number were in position. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/> Those familiar with the fort and the coast generally, inform us, that without the co-operation of a fleet outside, (which the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> cannot command,) it will require a force of <num value="30000">30,000</num> men to dislodge the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>We know that several regiments are now on their way to the sort from various points, and if there is any possibility of casting the vandals, it will be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>The position is of great consequence to the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>, and it must be retaken at all hazards. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/> If the foregoing statement be correct, the fact that the fortification was supplied with but <hi rend="italics"><num value="20">twenty</num> rounds of ammunition</hi> shows a remarkable want of preparation, and we suppose that Congress, if satisfied of the truth of the report, has already adopted such measures as may be necessary in the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>In the editorial columns of the <hi rend="italics">Dispatch</hi> will be found comments upon the affair, with a statement of the locality of <placeName reg="Fort Hatteras">Fort Hatteras</placeName> and its value as a strategic position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>The telegraph informs us that the <rs>Federals</rs> received information touching the fortifications from a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <rs type="role2">Captain</rs> who effected his escape from a privateer. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>We have had some skirmishing upon our pickets on our march, but not amounting to much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>I have been out of house every night, and for some days together, without a tent, and in continued rains for days and nights at a time, without any injury to health whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>We captured the enemy's mail, out of which we took the endorsed letter and many <num value="100">hundred</num> others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>This letter thus gives the lie to stories from <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName> of numerous killings and captures of our forces by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> in the <rs>Kanawha</rs> country. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>From the fact of having been born on the <rs>South</rs> side of a certain mysterious parallel of latitude, it was very natural to suppose that I should feel a degree of sympathy for my kindred and countrymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>It was in view of these circumstances that I frankly told you before the meeting of the <rs>New York Annual Conference</rs>, in <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> last, that if my position would occasion any embarrassment to the <rs type="place">Church</rs> I would at once vacate the charge.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/> Believing, as I do, that the condition of the world cannot be made better by converting the <rs>Christian</rs> pulpit into a political areas, I have never, in this city or elsewhere, introduced politics or war into the sacred desk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>Money to sustain and advance it is freely given, and the <rs>Government</rs>, we are told, has been pressed to give it countenance and support.
