<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/> Your refusal to receive in exchange your soldiers belonging to &#x0022;regiments whose times are out and who have been discharged,&#x0022; discloses a fixed purpose on the part of your Government to doom to hopeless captivity those prisoners whose term of service has expired, or will soon expire. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/> My offer to exchange the prisoners captured during the campaign precludes an intention on my part in the delivery to discriminate between your prisoners, as all would have been delivered; and, even had it been intended, this discrimination between your men, whose term of service had and had not expired, would have been impossible, and could not have been effected, as I had no reliable means of ascertaining what proportion of your men were entitled to their discharge. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/> Your avowal that this class of your soldiers will not be exchanged, but will be rewarded by the suffering and privations incident to military imprisonment, because their boldness and courage subjected them to capture, although their term of service had nearly expired, is deeply regretted by me, as I share the earnest desire of my Government to release from prolonged confinement the large number of prisoners held by both parties. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>In other cases, exemptions are extended to men calling themselves Government employees in departments, where, ostensibly, Government work is done; but often, under the sign of Government foundries and shops of a similar character, are made the more profitable and remunerative sorghum machines, sorghum boilers, and other articles, no less useful and needed in our country, but entirely out of the line of Government work, for which these men were detailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>There are other exempts, and a large number, too, who are to be found in the mail contract department, where the real contractor enjoys the luxury of exemption, but employ men, who actually pay for the privilege to carry out their contracts, whilst the contractors themselves roam the country in their speculative schemes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>If these men, and I suppose they form but a sample of the status of things in other sections of our State, and of other States, too, could be come at, and made available in the service, they might, if not &#x0022;able to plant our Southern cross on the spires of <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> before the ides of <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct>,&#x0022; surely they might do much, very much, to cripple the enemy now around our beloved city before the period arrives when our hated foe, largely reinforced, will make a desperate effort to accomplish something that may tell in the approaching presidential election.
