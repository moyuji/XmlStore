<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>The wheat, corn, and other farm product of the <rs>State</rs>, being shut out by the war from their annual markets, and the demand for them in any quantity being than incoming of almost exclusively to <num value="1">one</num> purchaser, to wit, the <rs>Government</rs> itself, the writer appears to the <rs>President</rs> of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> for protection to the farmers against the undue depression of the prices of these articles below the actual cost of production, by the agents of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>The people are obliged to sell in order to pay their taxes, and to provide for the extraordinary expenses of living induced by the war. They can only sell to the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>The Government has power to fix the prices of produce at its own figures; but it is in the last degree unwise and unjust to reduce these figures unremunerative price: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/> &#x0022;The Government is not poor &mdash; its credit is unlimited in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>It has the confidence and affection of the people.--All feel a personal interest in it, as the great engine of defence against a savage enemy who would deprive them of their rights and liberties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>Let not these feelings of respect and regard be weakened. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/> &#x0022;It is the dictate alike of policy and true dignity that its agents should not be permitted to Jew the people, but on all occasions to give fair, reasonable, moderate prices for the product of their labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/><num value="45">Forty-five</num> or <measure n="48cents" type="currency">48 cents</measure> for corn in the price now offered on the <rs>Mattaponi</rs> and <rs>Rappahannock</rs>; and red wheat, the kind principally used to make flour for the army, would not yield nett <measure n="80cents" type="currency">eighty cents</measure>. These are not reasonable prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>Those who sell do so from compulsion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>No farmer can make either for any such sum. Is it, then, consistent with the respect the <rs>Government</rs> owes to its itself?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>Does it accord with any sentiment of propriety and justice to reduce the cultivators of the soil to the necessity of taking such inadequate returns for their labors?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>The Government taxes them to such an extent as to force them to sell, and then fixes the price at least <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> less than the value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>It is not presumed that you yourself have given any attention to this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>No <num value="1">one</num> believes that you would lower the dignity of the <rs>Government</rs> or connive at injustice of any kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>You would doubtless recommend economy, but not parsimony. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/> &#x0022;It has not probably occurred to you, in the moist of your many important and absorbing engagements, that in making purchases for the army your agents were determining the price of bread, regulating the receipts for labor, and the interest on capital invested in agriculture. &#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/> Economy is the duty of the agents of the <rs>Government</rs>; but parsimony is officiousness of a very unpleasant sort; it is neither politic wise, nor just.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>Prices which do not repay the cost of production as well as a fair profit besides, are neither just nor judicious, when the purchaser has the absolute monopoly of the market. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/> The &#x0022;<placeName key="tgn,2114607" n="1.000 1" reg="tidewater, richmond, virginia">Tidewater</placeName>&#x0022; writer complains justly of the low prices of grain offered in his region of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>They are notoriously unremunerative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>For the <rs>Government</rs> to refuse to give more, is to refuse to give the prime cost of an article; is to rob the farmer of the portion of the cost that is lost by him. It is not only to exact the tax from him that is regularly assessed; but it is to exact from him an additional tax assessed in an irregular, indirect, and unjust form. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/> To the complaint of the farmers of the <rs>Rappahannock</rs> and <rs>Mattaponi</rs> on this subject, is added that of the farmers of <placeName reg="Culpeper, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2111394">Culpeper</placeName> and <persName n="Fauquier,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00031" reg="mostcommon:Fauquier,nomatch:0"><surname>Fauquier</surname></persName> in regard to their flour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>They are obliged to sell their flour in order to get money to live on and to pay their taxes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>The Government is the only purchaser they can find, as they are cut off from market by the war.--The Government offers them only <measure n="3.85dollars" type="currency">$3.85</measure> a barrel, which does not pay cost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>They cannot send their flour to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, where they could get <measure n="5.25dollars" type="currency">$5.25</measure>, because the <rs>Government</rs> holds possession of the railroads, and no transportation can be procured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>They are therefore forced to take <measure n="3.85dollars" type="currency">$3.85</measure>. They have suffered more than any other people by the war, by the presence of the army, and by its impressment of their horses, mules, wagons, and labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>It has cost them much more trouble and a greater outlay of money than ever before to secure their harvest this year; and yet, though suffering from all these causes, they are offered only <measure n="3.85dollars" type="currency">$3.85</measure> a barrel, which is a price unprecedentedly low. The Government pays <measure n="5.25dollars" type="currency">$5.25</measure> a barrel for flour in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and <measure n="66cents" type="currency">sixty-six cents</measure> a barrel for its transportation to <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, making a cost at that point of <measure n="5.91dollars" type="currency">$5.91</measure>. Yet the people who have flour on the spot are allowed only <measure n="3.85dollars" type="currency">$3.85</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/> It will not do to say that <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> flour is worth in ordinary years <measure n="1dollars" type="currency">one dollar</measure> more than country flour, for the flour of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> manufacture is worth the additional dollar only on account of its qualities as a shipping flour for the transit across the equator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>But no flour now has a shipping value, because none can be shipped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>If <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> flour could be shipped to <placeName reg="Rio Janeiro">Rio Janeiro</placeName> and <placeName reg="San Francisco, San Francisco, California" key="tgn,7014456">San Francisco</placeName>, it would be worth <measure n="6.25dollars" type="currency">$6.25</measure> a barrel, not <measure n="5.25dollars" type="currency">$5.25</measure>. To knock off the value given by its shipping quality, when it cannot be shipped, is palpably absurd.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/><num value="9">Nine</num>-<num value=".1">tenths</num> of the country superfine flour is as good for domestic consumption as <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> superfine flour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>it is, therefore, unjust to knock off a dollar per barrel on the flour, or <measure n="20cents" type="currency">twenty cents</measure> per bushel on the wheat, on a hypothesis which supposes open ports, the usual shipments to <placeName reg="South America" key="tgn,1000002">South America</placeName>, and which totally ignores the existence of the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/> The Government ought to be liberal to the farmers; for who have been more liberal than they to the <rs>Government</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>The farmers generously consent to receive Treasury notes and Confederate bonds at par. Why should they not receive at least par prices &mdash; cost prices &mdash; for their grain? </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>We are taught by the history of all wars, in all countries, that more men die of disease contracted in camp then are slain in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>It becomes a matter, then, of the highest importance that every possible precautionary measure should be used to obviate the causes of disease in our military camps, and insure the health of the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>That they are regularly supplied with wholesome food and warm blankets and clothing, is not sufficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>It is not always the want of these that produce disease in military camps &mdash; there are other laws of Nature regulating health, which must be consulted and regarded, if we would escape the fearful consequences of their violation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>Among these, and by far the most important, is that <num value="1">one</num> requiring pure air for healthy purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>In visiting many of the camps about <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, I find, by observation and upon inquiry, that the tents with which our troops are supplied are so constructed that, when the open end is drawn together and made fast, they become almost perfectly air-tight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>I find further, that from <num value="5">five</num> to <num value="7">seven</num> men are put in these tents to sleep. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/> Now, every <num value="1">one</num> who knows aught of the properties of which the air is composed, and their action upon the lungs, must see at once that disease and death are the necessary results of such a number of persons sleeping in an air-tight apartment so small as <num value="1">one</num> of the tents used by our troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>The lungs of a single man will consume in the course of a night much more of a vital principle of air, necessary to perfect health, than is contained in <num value="1">one</num> of these tents when closed up. The only remedy for the evils resulting from sleeping in close tents, is that which you suggest &mdash; viz.: open tents for the free circulation of air, with fires in front of them to secure the necessary warmth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>An experience of <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> of camp life in that region known as the <name>Everglades</name> of <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240"><rs type="direction">South</rs> Florida</placeName>, enables me to speak with some degree of confidence on this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>On <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> going to the <name>Everglades</name>, myself and those who were with me dreaded more than all things else the miasma, and when night came we closed our tents so as to permit no breath of fresh air to enter until morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>The consequence was, we were constantly troubled with colds, fevers, and other diseases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>But becoming convinced at last of the real cause, we abandoned the use of the tent altogether, and from the day we commenced to sleep in the open air with our feet to a fire which was kept burning through the night, we never afterwards had a case of sickness in the camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>Are they classed alien enemies?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>Shall A pay the debt to the <rs>Southern</rs> members of the firm, or to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>Again, suppose just such a state of affairs, with this difference &mdash; that the <rs>Southern</rs> members remain North, as they allege, to close up their business, or from compulsion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>To whom shall that debt be paid?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/> As to the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> inquiry, we need only inform our correspondent, (without troubling any tribunal,) that every man, woman, and child, high or low, rich or poor, who is domiciled in the enemy's country, is an &#x0022;alien enemy.&#x0022; The law even extends to branches of foreign houses doing business at the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>If a business is done in New York by <num value="10">ten</num> partners, and <num value="9">nine</num> are in the <rs>Southern</rs> army, it comes under the operation of the law.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>The last question may be briefly answered: If the <rs>Southern</rs> members remain at the <rs>North</rs> to close up their business, or for any other purpose, it makes no difference where they are &mdash; they are alien enemies if their business is conducted in the enemy's country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>The great regret of all who heard it seems to be that there is no copy of it to be laid before the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>It was emphatically a great peace speech, and in all respects equal to any of his finest efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>He said that he had retired from political life, and nothing but the great interest that he had in the peace and safety of the <rs>State</rs> had caused him to leave his home and come to <placeName reg="Frankfort, Franklin, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013939">Frankfort</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/> His great argument was in favor of peace and in opposition to the war. He felt anxious that the people of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> should oppose it. He argued that under the &#x0022;laws of nations&#x0022; no nation had a right to carry on a war for subjugation and conquest. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/> It was idle nonsense to talk about fighting for the honor of a flag, as demagogues pretend to do. A flag was the mere emblem of a nation, without intrinsic value, and no <num value="1">one</num> had sought to destroy it. The <rs>Judge</rs> was opposed to all wars, unless carried on to defend our soil from invasion, and to protect our rights, our liberties, and our firesides.--The <rs>North</rs>, he said, was suffering from none of these, and was therefore <hi rend="italics">prosecuting</hi> a war <hi rend="italics">commenced</hi> by her, and not waged in self-defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/>When she ceases to prosecute it, then will it end, and it ought to end.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/>He was no a coercionist and had not been out when <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> proposed to secede.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>The framers of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and other great lights had shown that coercion would be destructive of the <rs>Government</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/> From the <rs>Constitution</rs> he argued that if the <rs>Southern States</rs> believed that for their peace, safety, and happiness, it was necessary for them to withdraw, they had a right to do so, and they would leave the <rs>Northern States</rs> in the enjoyment of every right and privilege they had ever possessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>Their withdrawal never would justify a war upon the part of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>The Government was a partnership, and each State may claim its share of the public property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>It could not be claimed that the seceded States have more than their share of that property. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/> The <rs>Judge</rs> elaborated upon that great bulwark of freedom &mdash; the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi>--showing its origin and its benefits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/>He said that sufficient importance was not attached to it. It was a sacred right, and held so by the <rs>English</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>He was unwilling to carry on the war, when the power to suspend that <hi rend="italics">writ</hi> was not only assumed by the <rs>President</rs> himself, but is given to every bloodthirsty military commander whom he may choose to appoint. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/> No <num value="1">one</num> had a right to suspend that writ but Congress, and then only in times of invasion, &#x0026;c., as specified by the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>The Constitution had been violated in regard to the personal rights of citizens in cases of search and seizure, as is now practiced every day by the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>Men are not bound to maintain a Government under a Constitution that had been subverted by others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>He said the <rs>South</rs> was willing to support the <rs>Constitution</rs>, but was unwilling to support a usurpation, and would not submit to a war carried on for subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>We ought all to oppose the war, for it would bankrupt the <rs>State</rs>, and hopelessly burdon it with debt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>What can be done to save the <rs>State</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>He was opposed to the <rs>State</rs> going out of the <rs>Union</rs>, and yet he was afraid to stay in if the consequences were to be as <hi rend="italics">bad</hi> as if she went out. He thought we had better stay in so as not to give the <rs>North</rs> an excuse for treating us as badly as they had treated those States who had gone out. He regretted that the <rs>Government</rs> was in the hands of men who were reckless, and only desired plunder and self aggrandizement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>He wished that he had the power to rear up a mountain as high as the heavens with perpendicular walls of granite in order to keep the armies apart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>He hoped that the ocean might be girdled with a wall of fire so that the navies might be kept apart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>He would do anything, except sacrificing our honor, to arrest the war. Indeed, he thought it would be better to pay the <measure n="800000dollars" type="currency">$800,000</measure> to keep out of the war, not as a matter of right in the <rs>Government</rs> to tax us, but for the sake of peace. </p> </div4>
