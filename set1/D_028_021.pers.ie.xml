<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The English Commonwealth was then at the height of its power, and, at its head, <num value="1">one</num> who was admirably described by <persName n="Bossuet,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Bossuet,nomatch:0"><surname>Bossuet</surname></persName> as &#x0022;a man of an incredible depth of thought; as profound a hypocrite as he was a skillful politician; capable alike of concealing and undertaking everything; active and indefatigable equally in peace as war; so vigilant and active that he has never proved himself wanting to any opportunity which presented itself to his elevation; in fine, <num value="1">one</num> of those stirring and audacious spirits which seem born to overturn the world.&#x0022; Such was the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> and such the man, triumphant over all other enemies, against which this gallant Commonwealth, then numbering only <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> inhabitants, unfurled the standard of defence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> The Commonwealth of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> was disposed to submit to this resistance.--<placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, had arrayed itself on the side of the <rs>King</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>During the whole preceding struggle of <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName></persName> and the <name>Parliament</name>, <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> was firm in its adherence to the monarch, and enacted a declaration &#x0022;that they were born under a monarchy, and would never degenerate from the condition of their birth by being subject to any other government.&#x0022; After the beheading of <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName> <genName n="1">I</genName></persName>., <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> acknowledged the authority of his son, and actually continued the provincial government under a commission sent by him from his retreat at Breda to <persName n="Berkeley,Sir,William,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="default:Berkeley,William,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Berkeley</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The wrath of Parliament was intensely roused by this bold and persistent contumacy; an ordinance was issued declaring the inhabitants of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> notorious robbers and traitors, and all intercourse prohibited with them, either by the people of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, the inhabitants of the other <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> settlements, or with foreign nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Finally, a fleet was sent over to overpower the rebellious colony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>But observe the difference between the great intellects that then ruled <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>That this agreement should be tendered to all persons, and that such as should refuse to subscribe to it should have a year's time to remove themselves and effects from <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, and in the meantime enjoy equal justice.&#x0022; </item> </list> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> The remaining articles were of less importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>This was followed by a supplemental treaty, for the benefit of the <rs>Governor</rs> and Council, and such soldiers as had served against the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> &mdash; allowing them the most favorable terms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> We need not enumerate the unconditional-surrender terms proposed by <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The correspondence between the rights secured under the articles with the <rs>Commonwealth Parliament</rs>, and the rights mentioned in the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>, as violated by the <rs>British King</rs>, will suggest itself to every intelligent reader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>That Old Dominion, with all its traditional love of monarchy; would not permit even its born king to trample upon its rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>If it did not lead the way in the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Revolution, it came up in due time; and, like a broad-shouldered and double-jointed giant, carried it through when others tottered and trembled under the burthen. &#x0022;Beware of entrance to a quarrel, but, being in, bear it that the opposer may beware of thee,&#x0022; seems to have been always the maxim of this deliberate and plucky old Commonwealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>But for <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>'s Washington, what would have become of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Revolution? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> It becomes not us to speak of her career in the present war. She arrogates to herself no superiority over her patriotic and heroic sister States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>She has been reproached, indeed, for coming so late into the contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>It is true, that in this Revolution, as in that of '<num value="76">76</num>, she was not in a hurry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>She exhausted every effort for peace, conciliation and compromise before she drew the sword.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> An &#x0022;intelligent officer,&#x0022; whose prominent position in the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName> gives him peculiar means of obtaining correct information, and who was personally cognizant of all the events of the recent campaign of <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName>, has afforded the <orgName n="Augusta Constitutionalist" type="newspaper">Augusta <hi rend="italics">Constitutionalist</hi></orgName> a very clear insight into the movement of our forces beyond the <placeName key="tgn,2715022" n="1.000 335" reg="tennessee river, united states, north and central america">Tennessee river</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>The statements of the gentleman are so wholly impartial, and so eminently satisfactory, that the <hi rend="italics">Constitutionalist</hi> thinks the campaign was not so &#x0022;ill-starred&#x0022; and &#x0022;fruitless&#x0022; as has been generally imagined: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> &#x0022;From the moment <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName> entered the noble old &#x0027;Volunteer State,&#x0027; he drove the <rs>Federal</rs> forces before him until, beleaguered within the strong defences of <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>, they at last stood at bay.--At <placeName reg="Columbia, Maury, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098585">Columbia</placeName>, <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,nomatch:0"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName> evidently intended giving battle, for he planted his army in a fine position, behind formidable earthworks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Our commander, who, though impetuous and dashing, is not by any means reckless, instantly saw the needlessness of sacrificing so many valuable lives as would be necessary in making a direct assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Accordingly he quietly evaded the <rs>Federal</rs>, and, by crossing <placeName reg="Duck River, Hickman, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098878">Duck river</placeName> at a point <measure n="7miles" type="distance">seven miles distant</measure>, successfully flanked the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>This necessitated the retreat of <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,nomatch:0"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName>, our forces rapidly pursuing until reaching <placeName reg="Franklin, Williamson, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017751">Franklin</placeName>, where occurred the very short yet obstinate and bloody battle of which our readers have already been advised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Unfortunately, the coming on of night prevented us reaping all the advantages of that dearly bought victory, and the next morning developed the flight of the <rs>Federal</rs>, after a heavy loss in killed and wounded, prisoners, artillery and munitions of war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/> &#x0022;Hence, to the very gates of <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>, the path was plain and unembarrassed; and our gallant boys trod it with lightness of step and buoyancy of heart.--About the capital, <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName> established his lines, throwing up works and disposing his forces with the skill of an old master of the art of war. Until the <date value="12-15">15th of December</date> he maintained his position, annoying the enemy by daily reconnaissances and expeditions against his lines of communication, exterior posts and garrisons. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/> &#x0022;On the <date value="12-15">15th of December,</date> <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,nomatch:0"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName>, forced to do something by the pertinacious demands of his master at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, advanced upon <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName>, and was thoroughly worsted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>The succeeding day (the <num value="16" type="ordinal">16th</num>) he sallied forth anew, and attacked us with vehemence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Beaten completely upon each wing, he would have been completely overthrown had not an unfortunate <hi rend="italics">contretemps</hi> occurred, which immediately and disastrously changed the whole tide of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Our centre, though not severely pressed, gave way suddenly &mdash; our works were abandoned, and a flight ensued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>The wings, unable to contend longer, yielded, and what should have been a victory, with <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName> as a prize, resulted in a sad defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>This was <num value="1">one</num> of those inexplicable affairs that so mystify and darken the pages of history &mdash; especially in this war. It was wholly unaccountable, and, we fear, must ever remain so. We lost by this unluckily accident heavily in artillery, from the fact that our pieces were all placed in a battery behind the works, and the horses were in safety some distance in the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Our losses in men and other material were insignificant, while those of the enemy must have reached fully <num value="10000">ten thousand</num>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>In truth, he was quite as much surprised at the issue of the contest as our own commander.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/><measure n="6days" type="date">Six days</measure> thereafter our army was only <measure n="40miles" type="distance">forty miles</measure> from the battle-field, and without molestation withdrew to the south of the <placeName key="tgn,2715022" n="1.000 335" reg="tennessee river, united states, north and central america">Tennessee river</placeName>, bringing with it, among other supplies, <num value="1000">one thousand</num> beef cattle and <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> hogs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/> &#x0022;The retreat was marked by no precipitancy, the abandonment of no trains, nor the desertion of any troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>At <placeName reg="Columbia, Maury, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098585">Columbia</placeName> the <rs>Tennessee</rs> soldiers flocked about their favorite leader, <persName n="Cheatham,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Cheatham,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Cheatham</surname></persName>, and, though reluctant to leave their native State, expressed the noble and heroic determination to follow him wherever the good of the cause demanded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>The spirit of the people, as evinced both upon the advance and withdrawal of our army, is mentioned as in the highest degree patriotic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>They were liberal to the troops, as they have always been, and exultant at the prospect of redemption from the blighting tyranny of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and <persName n="Johnson,,Andy,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="default:Johnson,Andy,,,"><foreName>Andy</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Tyrannized over as they have been, they are still loyal and devoted to the interests of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>From them there is heard no whisper of reconstruction or further intercourse with the detested <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>Total and absolute independence is what they alone want &mdash; it is that for which they have already suffered untold wrongs &mdash; and for which they are ready to suffer a still greater accumulation of insult and oppression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>These stories were the offspring of idle fancies.
