<head>Beware of false confidence.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/> The people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> are buoyant with the hopes excited by the late great victory at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, and the stunning effect which it evidently produced upon the entire <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>Already we see signs of returning to that condition of false security which proved so nearly fatal after <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, and which has on other occasions so materially injured the cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>If we could hope to be heard in quarters where our counsel would be of avail, we would protest against <unclear></unclear> in such feelings agreeable as they doubtless are and tempting as they must be, to men whose <unclear></unclear> have been so long wound up to the utmost degree of tention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>It is persisely from this disposition to relax that the greatest danger is to be apprehended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>It is exactly in the very moment of victory that the danger in question is most apt to <unclear></unclear> us. Let us, then, still keep on the alert.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>Let us exert our energies to their utmost, precisely as though we had been defeated in every engagement, and had the foe thundering at the very doors of our Capital as we had him last summer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were stunned, dispirited, overwhelmed for the moment by the <unclear></unclear> at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, but already they begin to recover, and cry for another &#x0022;On to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>&#x0022; We published an article yesterday from the <orgName n="Philadelphia Press" type="newspaper">Philadelphia <hi rend="italics">Press</hi></orgName>.-- <unclear></unclear> paper &mdash; in which a new route is mapped off for the advance in which the possiblity of defeat forms not the smallest <hi rend="italics">item</hi> of the calculation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>In which the capture of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> and the &#x0022;suppression of the reballion&#x0022; are spoken of as future events with as much confidence as though the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> forces had never met with a check in attempting it. <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00196" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> has already made half a dozen reports, in the last of which he cuts down the number of his killed to <num value="1152">1,152</num>, and his wounded to about <num value="9000">9,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>He is endeavoring, at the instance no doubt of his employers, to raise the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> mind from the abyes of despair into which it seems to have fallen, and to prepare it for new enterprises. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/> We may be assured that the whole <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> press will join in this endeavor, and that it will be successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>In a fortnight universal Yankeedom will believe that the defeat at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, like the defeat at <placeName reg="Sharpsburg, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7014501">Sharpsburg</placeName>, was a great triumph, <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00197" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> has already given the hint for the manner in which this belief is to be wrought up by saying that he occupied a part of the battle ground, and that he waited <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> for <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00198" reg="nearbymention:Lee,William,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>, who did not venture to attack him. Slight as this hint may seem, it will be sufficient for the object in view; for there never existed upon earth a nation so ford of being cheated at the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> or so desirous to be regarded as &mdash; what nature never destined them to be &mdash; a great military people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>The <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName>, well understanding their temper, <unclear>repres</unclear> the late vaid and repulse of their troops to <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> as so many splendid victorian, declaring that they are of importance enough to counterbalance the disaster at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>And so the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> will be sure to consider it, and thus considering it, they will believe that the war is still in their favor; that their army is the bravest army that ever existed, and, in spite of the <num value="100">hundred</num> <unclear></unclear> they have received that they are still able to beat us, take our capital, and subdue our country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00199" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> will be supported in all his measures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>In the spring an army of a <num value="1000000">million</num> will take the field, and that army we must meet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>It is vain to hope for peace until we shall have destroyed, dispersed, or warn out that army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>The Northern Democracy cannot help us if they would, and they are only in our favor provided we submit to them and come back into the <rs>Union</rs> on the old terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/><dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct>, we expect more from the <name>Abolitionists</name> than from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>The Abolitionists &mdash; such as <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00200" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName>, for example &mdash; had rather recognize the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> than have it back on any other terms than those of absolute subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>There is no hope from abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>There is no hope in any thing but our brave troops, our great <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, and a wise and efficient administration of the <rs>Government</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/> We are, at present, pressed nowhere but in the <rs>Southwest</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>The enemy evidently will not make another attempt to take <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> <unclear></unclear> winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>We have <num value="3">three</num> whole months at least <unclear>ress</unclear> the conscription.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>If fully carried out it will give us &mdash; with the army now in the field--<num value="700000">700,000</num> men for our operations in the spring, all of them between the ages of <num value="18">18</num> and <num value="40">40</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>With such an army we can destroy utterly every <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> that care venture out of reach of his flict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>Let our authorities do their utmost to bring it all out and, depend upon it they will bring out enough to insure peace, and a glorious peace, before the end of the summer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>They will bring out enough to render all the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> expenditure abortive; and when this levy shall have been battled they will never be able to raise another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>We have a <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> who brings with him a high reputation &mdash; no doubt well deserved &mdash; for talents, <unclear></unclear> and business qualifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>His advent to office has been most suspicious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>It has already been marked by the greatest battle and the most signal triumph of the whole war. Let us hope that his administration will be as fortunate to the end as it has been in the commencement, and &mdash; that it may be so &mdash; that he will devote all the energies of his mind to the organization of the conscription, and the rendering it efficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>But to this end something more is requisite than even the acknowledged abilities of the <rs>Secretary</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>A <unclear></unclear> should be established in connection with and under the control of his office, to be devoted especially to this <num value="1">one</num> object and it should be filled by the ablest man it is possible to find.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>He should have no other business but that connected with the conscription.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>The Governors of the <name>States</name>, and all magistrates and civil officers of every description, should be appealed to in the most earnest terms to lend all the assistance which their offices enable them to lend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>Thus only can we raise a force to encounter the <num value="1000000">million</num> of men about to be hurled against us. Thus only can we render this last gigantic effort abortive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>Thus only can we <unclear></unclear> an honorable, a beneficial and a lasting peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>That peace, if these conditions be observed, is right at hand; if they be not observed, it is infinitely distant. </p> </div3>

<head><placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/> The gartulous <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> newspapers proclaim that <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> is to be <num value="1">one</num> of their next points of attack, preparatory to the capture of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.--<num value="1">One</num> of their newspapers is of opinion that if <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> is taken, the whole <rs>South</rs> will immediately fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>They are kind enough to add that, having taken <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, a cavalry force will be sent to <persName n="Burke,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00201" reg="mostcommon:Burke,nomatch:0"><surname>Burke</surname></persName>'s, at the junction of the <rs>South Side</rs> and <rs>Danville</rs> railroads, and that the destruction of both roads will be the inevitable consequence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>So that <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> will be likely to divide with <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> the attention of the civilized and uncivilized world. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/> Our sister city, the gallant <rs>Cockade</rs>, is worthy the fame that is about to be thrust upon her. She too, like <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, will become histories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>She too, like <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, will never be taken by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> city of the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> in commercial importance and now that <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> has been depopulated, the most purely <placeName reg="Virginia City, Storey, Nevada" key="tgn,7014573">Virginia city</placeName> in the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>; she would be a sweet morsel to <unclear></unclear> under the tongues of the greedy <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> invaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>But we trust and believe that no such dismal fate awaits her. A more herote, generous, and noble community cannot be found under the sun. No city in the <rs>South</rs> has surpassed her in devotion to the <rs>Southern</rs> <unclear></unclear> and in contritutions to the physical and moral strength of the <rs>Southern</rs> armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>Even if she were not important to the defence of the <rs>Capital</rs>, the character of her people would rally all hearts and arms to her support.--We cannot afford in any point of view, to let the barbarian <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> desecrate by their presence this old <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> editors who prate to <unclear>ppantly</unclear> of that achievement have no very intelligent ideas of the difficulties by which it is surrounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>But we would not discourage them from making the attempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>They have flied <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>.
