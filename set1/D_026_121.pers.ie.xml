<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/> &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">Resolved</hi> That the <rs>President</rs> be requested to inform the <rs type="place">House</rs>, if not incompatible with the public interest, whether the reasons given in his special message for suspending the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> still exist, and what additional reason now exist to such extent that the public safety requires the continuance of the suspension thereof.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/> In my opinion, the reasons given in the special message transmitted to Congress at its last session recommending the suspension of the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus,</hi> still exist in undiminished force, and the present juncture especially requires the continuance of the suspension.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>The effects of the law for that purpose have been most salutary, and to that law in no inconsiderable degree are we indebted for the increased efficiency of the military preparations which have enabled our gallant armies under the providence of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, to beat back the vast invading forces which still threaten us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/> In my opinion it would be perilous, if not calamitous, to the discontinue the suspension while the armies of the enemy are pressing on our brave defenders with persistent effort for their destruction, and for the subjugation of our country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>It is a source of gratification to be able to inform you that the mere passage of the law suspending the writ was so efficient in restraining those who were engaged in treasonable practices, and in dangerous complicity with our enemies, that the instances are extremely few in which arrests were found necessary. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/> The effect of the law in preventing the abuse of the writ, for the purpose of evading military service, by men whose plain duty it is to defend their country, can hardly be overestimated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/> The sensitiveness exhibited in different parts of the country to the legislation on this subject, is indicative of the love of freedom which is innate among the people, and which should ever he cherished as the sole guarantee for the preservation of their constitutional liberties. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/> It is not doubted, however, that if those who have expressed dissatisfaction with the law had been in possession of the information which it was my duty to communicate to you, and which may not yet be revealed without injury to the public interests, they would fully have approved the exercise of the power of suspending the writ, which was entrusted to Congress by the <rs>Constitution</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/> All trusts impose duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>The power was entrusted expressly with the intent that it should be used when necessary to the public safety in case of invasion Congress, concurring with me that the exigency had arisen which required the exercise of the power, performed but a plain duty in passing the law, and such will, I doubt not, be the judgement of the people when the facts can be made known without detriment to their interests. </p> <closer> <signed><persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00096" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName>  <surname>Davis</surname></persName>.</signed> </closer> </div4>

<head>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> Giving away the lands of the <rs>South</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/> Late Northern papers bring accounts of the passage, in the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> of the <orgName n="Federal Congress" type="congress">Federal Congress</orgName>, of a bill to give as homesteads to soldiers and sailors, <hi rend="italics">without regard to color,</hi> &#x0022;the confiscated lands in insurrectionary districts. &#x0022; It passed by a vote of <num value="75">75</num> to <num value="64">64</num>--a majority of <num value="11">11</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>The chief defender of the bill was <num value="1">one</num> <persName n="Julian,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00237" reg="mostcommon:Julian,nomatch:0"><surname>Julian</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>In the course of the debate on it, <persName n="Pendleton,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00238" reg="mostcommon:Pendleton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Pendleton</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, contended that under the present law the forfeiture of lands was not to extend beyond the lifetime of the owners, and besides, that at the present time they had not required lands to be divided into homesteads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/><persName n="Julian,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00239" reg="mostcommon:Julian,nomatch:0"><surname>Julian</surname></persName> replied that large districts were coming into their (<rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>) possession, which were to be sold for taxes, and there was no law (<rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>) on the statute book which stood in the way of acquiring the fee of estates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>Of course!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/><persName n="Julian,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00240" reg="mostcommon:Julian,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Julian</surname></persName> is right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>There never is anything either in Constitution or law which stands in the way of the appropriation of the property of the <rs>Southern</rs> people to their own uses, by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>Yet the meagre majority of <hi rend="italics"><num value="11">eleven</num></hi> on the passage of the bill in the <rs type="place">House</rs> was a small fanatical majority to boast of, and much too small for the passage of a measure such as the bill on which it was obtained, proposing, as it does, to eject a people from their homes and lands, and cutting them up amongst soldiers and sailors of all colors as rewards for their services in the war of invasion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/> It is quite in keeping with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> character and cunning that such a bill as this should pass the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Congress at this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>It is not that they possess lands that they may, with impunity, out up and give as rewards to the myrmidons they are now sending to spread devastation wherever they can in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>It is merely to hold up to them the charming seductions to the service in the war of invasion &mdash; to stimulate them to the prosecution of that war in the most ferocious and brutal manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>A &#x0022;home in Dixie&#x0022; has been the blissful anticipation of the mercenary invader from the beginning of the war &mdash; the rich reward of his hardships in camp and his trials and perlis in the terrible encounter with the <rs>Southern</rs> soldiers, whose prowess and courage they so well appreciate that nothing short of a promised reward like that of this <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> bill could tempt a vast number of them to come in the way of. The war has been waged from the beginning on this principle of dividing the spoils of invasion amongst the invaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> there was some little caution, some kind of deference for the opinion of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>The laws took not the responsibility of the spoliation; the work was left to military commandants of posts and to those brutal bands which plundered undefended districts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> even <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00241" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> admitted that there was no authority in the <rs>Constitution</rs> to disturb the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> in the <rs>South</rs>; but gradually all respect for the <rs>Constitution</rs>, all respect for public opinion, yielded to the dishonest and brutal designs which the <rs>Government</rs> had harbored in the beginning, and now they have arrived at the point which they designed at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to reach &mdash; of claiming the entire property of the people of the <rs>South</rs> as belonging to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> and their Government! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/> It may be asked how is it that the <name>Satanic</name> <orgName n="Federal Congress" type="congress">Federal Congress</orgName> can presume to divide our lands amongst the mercenary soldiers and negroes of their armies, at the time when the <rs>Southern</rs> troops are repelling them in every field, and when the heaviest disasters that have fallen upon Federal arms since the war began have followed in quick succession the present year?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>Very plainly, because this is the very time that they need troops, and the bribe of the rich lands of the <rs>South</rs>, with their comfortable homes, are held up to stimulate enlistments amongst foreigners and negroes, the riff-raff of all nations, that their armies may be replenished, and they may yet continue a little longer the blood shed and the rapine of their barbarous war of invasion of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>It is the very time for such a bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>Had they met with no reverses &mdash; had they conquered everywhere, and been sure of the subjugation of the <rs>South</rs> without further extra exertion &mdash; they never would have offered the lands of the <rs>South</rs> to soldiers of all colors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>They would have set them apart to pay the war debt, and the soldier would have been left to his bounty and pay as quite sufficient for his services.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>But there is more work to be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>More men are wanted, and they are willing to pledge lands that they have not yet conquered &mdash; to give valuables never yet in their possession &mdash; to those who will peril their lives in acquiring it!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>It is a safe bargain--<num value="1">one</num> of that description especially agreeable to the <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritans</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>If they succeed by it, and don't like it, they can repeal it.--It is a handsome specimen of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> craftiness, subtlety, and dishonesty. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
