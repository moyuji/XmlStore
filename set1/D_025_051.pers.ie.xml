<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> --We publish this morning the letter of <persName n="Memminger,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:Memminger,C.,G.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Memminger</surname></persName> to <persName n="Hunter,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,R.,M.,T.,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hunter</surname></persName> on the state of the finances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>It presents an encouraging view of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>It is gratifying to see that so large an amount of notes has been converted into bonds; but it is still more gratifying to learn from him that, with the present systems of taxation in money and in kind, and some hoped for measure of Congress, <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> M. expects to dispense with the necessity of a further increase of the currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>He states that the present circulation is about <num value="3">three</num> times the sum required for the business and trade of the country, they being able to maintain a circulation of <measure n="150000000dollars" type="currency">$150,000,000</measure>, while the amount of notes afloat is <measure n="452979806dollars" type="currency">$452,979,806</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> <persName n="Memminger,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Memminger,C.,G.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Memminger</surname></persName> is correct in saying, with these figures, that the price, of gold is no criterion of the depreciation of the <rs>Confederate</rs> money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The present excess of circulation is no justification for a depreciation anything like, that exhibited by the price of gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The gold of the banks is held by them as the basis of their circulation, to be used upon the resumption of specie payments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The country having been pretty will drained there is now no gold outside their vaults worthy of estimation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Therefore, in commercial phrase, the &#x0022;market is bare,&#x0022; and the rate of such an article cannot be pronounced &#x0022;current,&#x0022; since it is itself not &#x0022;current.&#x0022; The speculative demand for such securities as may be used abroad to run the blockade appreciates them in like manner, and affords, also, an unfair standard, by which it is too common to estimate the depreciation of Confederate notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>To these we may add the enormous prices of blockade goods, which not only represent the premium of the funds with which they have been bought, but also the dangers and perils of the business of blockade running.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>It is, therefore, altogether among to estimate the value of our currency by any of these indicators. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> With the statements of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> before us we must conclude, however, that all the necessaries of life are held at excessively high prices, and the fact must be attributable to the mistaken estimates drawn from these erroneous standards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The <rs>Secretary</rs>'s letter, it is to be hoped, will do something towards correcting these wild calculations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>It is bad enough at best; but there is no justification for the inflation of prices from <num value="5">five</num> to <num value="10">ten</num> times their proper rates. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> There is no doubt that apprehension of the future has a great deal to do with the distrust of the paper money afloat, and the only way on earth to realize those apprehensions is for the people who indulge in them to act as if they were well founded &mdash; i. e., to continue to charge the enormous prices which must accelerate the flood of paper money to meet the enormous expenditure of conducting the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> The taxation at last employed by the <rs>Government</rs> will improve the condition of the currency and help to correct the public apprehensions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>If the <rs>Government</rs> will employ successfully any means in addition still further to reduce the circulation, a short time will make a great change in affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Money will be scarcer &mdash; prices will come down, and people be better contented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> has magnificent resources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>No Government on earth has such as she can command after the war. The people ought to feel the utmost confidence in them, and Government and people ought to continue to check extortionate prices, and thus keep the public debt within reasonable bounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The promise to pay of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> is that of a solvent debtor, and nothing can make it anything else but a heedless and unnatural panic among the very people who support the <rs>Government</rs> and on whom its credit rests &mdash; a panic which begets distrust, and by swelling the public debt to a monstrous aggregate through fabulous prices, force repudiation by the people of that debt which must he after all <num value="1">one</num> due chiefly to themselves! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> But a better state of feeling must prevail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>A wiser view of the subject and a patriotic sense of duty must co-operate with the <rs>Government</rs> in producing a healthier condition of affairs. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>But, when it is considered that a very large portion of these notes are across the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, it will be apparent that in the <rs>Atlantic States</rs> the estimate of <num value="3">three</num> to <num value="1">one</num> is rather over than under the mark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/><num value="2">Two</num> absorbents are now added which will keep down the excess from new issue <unclear></unclear> namely: the taxes and the sale of cotton <unclear></unclear>--and when the tax in kind <unclear></unclear> to contribute its portion to the support of the <name>Amy</name> there is every reason to believe that the <unclear></unclear> be well sustained. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/> It is obvious, from this statement, that the popular notion of estimating the value of the currency by a comparison with gold, it altogether fallacious; for, while the actual volume of currency has only been increased <num value="3">three</num> fold, its proportion to gold rates at more than double that amount.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>The fact is as you well know, that, situated as we are, gold is as much a commercial commodity as platina or tin, and its price is governed by the law of demand and supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>As I have already shown, in the report referred to, wheat and corn afford much more reliable standards of value when their price is not controlled by some local obstruction; and, by referring to these, it will be seen that the currency has maintained itself at the ratio which the outstanding issues indicate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>You will perceive by the statement that, uniting all the various appliances for funding, there has been funded in bonds <measure n="333404670dollars" type="currency">$333,404,670</measure>, to which, according to estimate, there is yet to be added about <measure n="70000000dollars" type="currency">$70,000,000</measure> more, which are yet in the hands of the <name>Treasury</name> officers to be funded, making in all about <measure n="302000000dollars" type="currency">$302,000,000</measure>. Add to this <measure n="15442000dollars" type="currency">$15,442,000</measure>, deposited in the <num value="0.05">five per cent</num>, call loan, and we have an aggregate of nearly <measure n="318000000dollars" type="currency">$318,000,000</measure> withdrawn from the currency. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/> This result is certainly very favorable, and shows that the measures adopted by Congress have been quite as successful as any of as had anticipated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>It is somewhat remarkable that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government should have adopted exactly the same measures for withdrawing their circulation, and, according to a statement published in <persName n="Hunt,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00124" reg="mostcommon:Hunt,nomatch:0"><surname>Hunt</surname></persName>'s <hi rend="italics">Merchants'magazine,</hi> for <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>, they have funded, in call loan and bonds, not more than <measure n="300000000dollars" type="currency">$300,000,000</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/> These figures show that there is no reason for distrust as to our currency; and if, when Congress meets, you will all address yourselves vigorously to measures which will restrain its further increase, we shall be fully able to maintain our cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>I would suggest to you <num value="2">two</num> matters for consideration: <num value="1">One</num> is the export duty which I proposed, and the other is a renewal of the call loan for all Treasury notes upon the same principle with the <num value="0.06">six per cent</num>, call loan which was reported at the last session. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/> It is worth the experiment to try whether, by allowing a deposit in the <name>Treasury</name>, on interest, we may not be able to attract and retain there all the <name>Treasury</name> notes not actually required for circulation. </p> <closer> <salute>Very truly, yours.,</salute> <lb/> <signed><persName n="Memminger,,C.,G.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00125" reg="default:Memminger,C.,G.,,"><foreName>C.</foreName> <foreName>G.</foreName>  <surname>Memminger</surname></persName>,</signed> <lb/> <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs>. </closer> </div4>
