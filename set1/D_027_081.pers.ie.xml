<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> Since our last report military operations below <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> have been somewhat active, though the enemy have gained no advantage since the capture of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Fort Harrison</placeName> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/><dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> there was some desultory firing, but as the day was rainy and disagreeable, it was generally supposed that there would be no fighting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>As the day advanced, however, a heavy cannonade commenced, which, about <time value="4:30oclock">half-past 4 o'clock</time> in the afternoon, surpassed in rapidity and sound anything ever before heard in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The reports of heavy guns fully shook the houses in the city, and from elevated positions the smoke could be distinctly seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>This continued until hear <time value="6oclock">six o'clock</time>, and some imaginative persons were under the impression that a general engagement was in progress on the very environs of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Some fancied they could hear the rattle of musketry at intervals, and numerous conjectures were indulged respecting the nature and progress of the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The reports of cannon averaged about <num value="1">one</num> a minute, while at times they were even more frequent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The cause of all this excitement was explained yesterday by persons from the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>It appears that the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 10">Tenth corps</orgName> of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army, now commanded by <persName n="Birney,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Birney,nomatch:0"><surname>Birney</surname></persName>, advanced on the <rs type="place">Darbytown</rs> and <address><street n="Charles City road">Charles City roads</street></address>, accompanied by a considerable body of cavalry, under <persName n="Spears,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Spears,nomatch:0"><surname>Spears</surname></persName>, and succeeded in getting to the vicinity of the intermediate line of entrenchments, some <placeName><distance reg="2.5miles">two miles and a half</distance> below <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The object of this movement is believed to have been a reconnaissance in force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>At this point our batteries opened upon the enemy and prevented their getting into position, and they retired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Many of our citizens were yesterday disposed to treat this affair as a false alarm, and persons who professed to have been at the front asserted that there was no enemy within sight of our artillerymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>It was therefore talked about as a great waste of ammunition to no purpose whatever; but we have every reason to believe that the foregoing statement of the advance of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> is correct. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> A portion of the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName> fleet has been engaged since <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> in shelling <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Fort Harrison</placeName>; but no <orgName n="General Assault" type="misc">general assault</orgName> has been made by our troops since <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>, and the enemy still hold the position. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> Yesterday, with the exception of some skirmishing near <placeName reg="Chaffin's Bluff">Chaffin's Bluff</placeName>, no fighting took place on the lines below <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>In the morning the enemy's skirmishers advanced and drove in our pickets at that point, but our men rallied, and in turn drove the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>It was currently reported yesterday that the enemy were recrossing to the southside of the <rs>James</rs>, but up to the time of writing this paragraph this lacks confirmation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> Among the captured in <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Fort Harrison</placeName> were <persName n="Maury,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Maury,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Maury</surname></persName>, commandant of <placeName reg="Chaffin's Bluff">Chaffin's Bluff</placeName>, and <persName n="Taylor,Major,R.,C.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="default:Taylor,R.,C.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Taylor</surname></persName>, (brother of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s adjutant-general) commandant of artillery at the same post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The fort was manned by about <num value="300">three hundred</num> reserves, who made a feeble resistance, and all fled except <num value="75">seventy-five</num>, who were captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The report that the <rs type="place">City</rs> Battalion (the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA25">Twenty-fifth Virginia</orgName>) behaved badly in this affair is untrue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Not more than <num value="12">twelve</num> of the command were there at the time, and they were on the sick list.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The battalion was ordered from <placeName reg="Newmarket Hill">Newmarket Hill</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,7014404" n="1.000 6" reg="petersburg, petersburg, virginia">Fort Gilmer</placeName>, and bore a conspicuous part in the defence of that place, assisted by the command of <persName n="Dubois,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Dubois,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Dubois</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The repulse of the enemy here was decided, and their loss heavy, while ours was comparatively right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>It is estimated that in the woods, in front of <placeName key="tgn,7014404" n="1.000 6" reg="petersburg, petersburg, virginia">Fort Gilmer</placeName>, from <num value="600">six hundred</num> to <num value="700">seven hundred</num> of the enemy are laying dead, and after the fight the trench before the fort was filled with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The attack was made by negroes, and some who were captured say that they were forced on by white troops at the point of the bayonet, and threatened with instant death if they retreated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>It is in this way that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> show their affection for their &#x0022;pet&#x0022; <rs n="African" type="ethnic">Africans</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The commands of <persName n="Elliott,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Elliott,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonels</roleName> <surname>Elliott</surname></persName> and <persName n="Dubois,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Dubois,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel"></roleName><surname>Dubois</surname></persName> were highly complimented by the general commanding for their gallantry during the assault. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> Several farm houses below the city have been burnt within the past <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure>--some of them by the enemy and some by our own forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> burnt the dwellings of <persName n="Duke,,Thomas,T.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="default:Duke,Thomas,T.,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <surname>Duke</surname></persName> and <persName n="Loflin,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Loflin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Loflin</surname></persName>, while our people destroyed <persName n="Hughes,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Hughes,nomatch:0"><surname>Hughes</surname></persName>' tavern, the houses of <persName n="Clay,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Clay,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Clay</surname></persName>, <persName n="Weaver,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Weaver,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Weaver</surname></persName>, and the barn of <persName n="White,,Joseph,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="default:White,Joseph,,,"><foreName>Joseph</foreName> <surname>White</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Some of these were probably accidentally fired by shell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The report that the houses of <persName n="Davis,,John,N.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="default:Davis,John,N.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>N.</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> and <persName n="Cook,,E.,B.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="default:Cook,E.,B.,,"><foreName>E.</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Cook</surname></persName> were destroyed is incorrect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Many of the citizens of <placeName reg="Henrico, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1002467">Henrico</placeName> have been plundered by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and are heavy sufferers in consequence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/><num value="1">One</num> instance of the preservation of a sum of money under singular circumstances has been brought to our notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>A resident of the county, on the approach of the enemy, fled from his home, bringing away such articles as could be hastily got together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>He had placed <measure n="4000dollars" type="currency">four thousand dollars</measure> upon a bureau, intending to move it, but came away and left the money behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The next day he ventured to return to his house, and found that it had been visited and searched by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>; but the money had slipped behind the bureau and was all recovered by the owner. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> It was reported last evening that the enemy, in considerable force, were advancing on the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>, and that some skirmishing took place at the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName> yesterday morning. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> <persName n="Uhihorn,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="default:Uhihorn,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Uhihorn</surname></persName>, an employee of the <orgName n="Southern Express Company" type="company">Southern Express Company</orgName>, and <persName n="Baumhard,,Christopher,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="default:Baumhard,Christopher,,,"><foreName n="Christopher">Chr.</foreName> <surname>Baumhard</surname></persName>, a resident of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, were captured by the enemy while on a scouting expedition below <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>They belonged to <num value="1">one</num> of the local cavalry companies. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Their bodies were left lying upon the spot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Surely this act calls for some retaliation at the hands of our authorities. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/> In your issue of the <dateStruct value="--1"><day reg="1">1st instant</day></dateStruct> appears an article signed &#x0022;Cavalry,&#x0022; asserting that the most important reason for the inefficiency of the cavalry branch of the service &#x0022; is the ownership by the men of the horses they ride,&#x0022; and the consequent reluctance to expose the said horses to danger on account of not being able to replace the same, because the <rs>Government</rs> will only pay <measure n="200dollars" type="currency">two hundred dollars</measure> for horses actually killed in service, which, he says, will not pay for the red tape consumed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>Aside from thus putting the value of horse-flesh before every consideration of duty and patriotism, and the fear of being compelled to serve on foot, the article exhibits either the most deplorable ignorance of facts in this the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> year of the war, or an interested and wilful misrepresentation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/> As <num value="1000">thousands</num> upon <num value="1000">thousands</num> have been paid for horses killed, there ought to be little excuse for ignorance at this late date.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>The law in force provides that for horses killed, or mortally wounded, in action, the owners shall be paid therefore the appraised value of the same at the date of entry or muster in the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>The <measure n="200dollars" type="currency">two-hundred dollar</measure> law is an old law of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, still in force, under which claimants who have failed to comply with the regulations to enable them to come under the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> law can sometimes recover at least some compensation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>If a soldier neglects the simple precaution of having his horse properly appraised upon entry into service, he has none to blame but himself. </p> <closer> <signed>Veritas.</signed> </closer> </div3> </div2>
