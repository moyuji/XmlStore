<head>The Meeting of Congress.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/> Congress will meet on <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>It may be doubted whether any deliberative body ever met under more serious circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>The finances of our country are in a most distracted condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>We are invaded from every point of the compass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/><num value="1">One</num> of our armies has just met with a disastrous defeat.--It has become evident that no State will recognize us. Every demagogue cries out &#x0022;crisis&#x0022; in the most peaceful times, whenever his own election is in danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>There is no doubt that we are in a crisis now, and a <hi rend="italics">real</hi> crisis &mdash; not such an <num value="1">one</num> as demagogues delight in creating for their own advantage. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/> In such a crisis what does it behoove Congress to do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>There is but <num value="1">one</num> answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>To go to work in earnest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>To do the business that is before them, and let their popularity take care of itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>To believe that members of Congress have some loftier views than getting themselves re-elected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>To recollect that they have a country, and that that country can be benefited only by action, and not by talking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>Oh! let them for Heaven's sake, for the sake of the country, for the sake of their constituents, abjure speech making.--This is no time for Bunkum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>The day when speeches could be made for that locality with effect is gone by. The time is come for action, action, action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>He who wastes the precious hours of the session in speech-making is an enemy to his country, a traitor to his cause, a wretch who ought to be expelled from the boundaries of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>He does more harm than <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00291" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> found it possible to do with <num value="150000">150,000</num> men &mdash; more harm than <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00292" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> has just done us at <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> &mdash; more harm than all Yankeedom, with all its malignity, has been, or ever will be, able to do us. Let no such man be trusted; for he is <num value="1">one</num> who would ruin his country to astonish his constituents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>Cough him down, hiss him out, put the previous question upon him; make his seat too hot to hold him, do anything to get rid of his everlasting gabble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>Above all, pass a law allowing no man to speak more than once on the same question, and limiting every speech to <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure>. A man who cannot tell what he has to say in <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure> is not fit to speak at all. He can instruct nobody, and can give no reason for his own vote, which is fit for a man of sense to hear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>For Heaven's sake put into <placeName reg="Coventry, Coventry, England" key="tgn,7011012">Coventry</placeName> all who would turn Congress into a debating club.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>Cut them dead &mdash; let the finger of scorn be fixed upon them, for they are men who would betray their country to promote their own ambitious views. </p> </div3>

<head>The croakers.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/> The fraternity of the <rs type="place">Dismal Swamp</rs> have had an entertainment of unusual richness in the late misfortunes of the country in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>Never since the beginning of the war have their croaking been combined in a more solemn and guttural chorus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>The <rs type="place">Dismal Swamp</rs> never yielded such lugubrious melodies at the frogs who have sate upon the banks of the <rs type="place">River of Death</rs> and groaned themselves hoarse over its bloody tide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>It is almost a pity that their sweet voices should be checked by the stern war-cry of <persName n="Cleburne,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00293" reg="mostcommon:Cleburne,nomatch:0"><surname>Cleburne</surname></persName> and the angry roar of the undismayed warriors whom <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00294" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> has found to be lions at bay. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/> It is a mistake to suppose that the race of croakers is a forlorn and broken-hearted race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>On the contrary, they are never so happy as when they are miserable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>Their solemn, guttural utterances only arise from the peculiar conformations of their organism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>Were the sky always bright, and the atmosphere clear and healthful, the whole generation of croakers would die off from the face of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>It is only when night lets fall her black curtain that the owls and bats come forth from their hiding places and exult in the universal darkness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/> If the croakers of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> would confine themselves to the luxury of war, and refrain from acting as censors upon the conduct of their civil and military superiors, they would not be worth the powder and shot necessary for their extermination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>But they consider themselves competent to criticise anybody and everybody, and are as obstreperous in their censures as their sorrows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>They are not content with being out of the army, with being protected in their persons and estates from even the <num value="8">eight</num> of an armed foe, but they must keep up a brisk fire in the rear of their civil and military protectors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>Not being engaged in fighting the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, they give exercise to the valor which might otherwise rust in inaction, by furious assaults upon Confederate <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>They could manage affairs of State and of arms much better than they are managed ! Why don't they do it, then?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>If they are so much wiser than our rulers, why can't they convince the world of the fact, and persuade somebody to put them in a position where their magnificent brains would be of service to their country?--If they know better than our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> what ought to be done, why have they never given the army the invaluable aid of their presence and counsels?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>If they are as great in action as in speech, and will go to the front, they will bring the war to a close in <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>. It is very easy to find fault, and to saddle every misfortune upon the misconduct of our leaders, but the public at large ought to bear in mind that, unless they know all the facts, and are well instructed in military matters, they ought to withhold their verdict upon the public men charged with the responsibility of a military misfortune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>The Government, which knows all the facts, must be presumed to have grounds for its action or non-action which, for reasons of public interest, cannot always be made known to the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>When <persName n="Johnston,General,Joseph,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00296" reg="default:Johnston,Joseph,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <foreName n="Joseph">Jo.</foreName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> was at <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>, in the beginning of the war, he was as roundly abused for not fighting the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and it was not until he swooped down upon them at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> that some of his critics believed there was any fight in him. We have suffered a defeat at <placeName reg="Chickamauga, Walker, Georgia" key="tgn,7013598">Chickamauga</placeName>, and we gained a victory there also; but the victory did not stop the mouths of the croakers, for it was not followed up. Do they know, or can they pretend to know, why it was not followed up?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>Are they sure that <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00297" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName> had the means of pursuit or was in a condition to follow?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>If he had, why should he, a soldier, whose business it is to know all about following up, neglect to win laurels which he must be as anxious to obtain as others to obtain for him?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>If he was afterwards defeated, who can tell us what his means of resistance were, how many men he had, and whether he was expected, with possibly <num value="1">one</num> man to <num value="4">four</num>, to accomplish impossibilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>If all the croakers of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> had been at his back </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/> he might have contended with <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00298" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> on terms approaching to equality, and the result have been different. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/> The truth is, we have been struggling from the beginning of this war against such enormous odds that the wonder to our mind is, not that we have occasional disasters, but that disaster has not been the rule, and success the exception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>At the outset of the struggle there were not <rs n="percussion caps" type="product">percussion caps</rs> enough in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to supply a single regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>In all the other munitions of war we were lamentably deficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>As for men, our sparse population did not seem to afford a mouthful for the hungry giant of the <rs>North</rs>, backed by the inexhaustible swarms of the Old World.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> had everything at its command; we nothing and shut up by the blockade from obtaining anything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>Yet what a fight the <rs>Confederacy</rs> has made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>But, not withstanding all this, the croakers demand universal and uninterrupted victory and success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>We are as sorry as themselves that we cannot have it, but we must limit our expectations to our means; we must be thankful that we have done so much better than we had a right to expect; we must draw hopeful auguries of the future from the past. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
