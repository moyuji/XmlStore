<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>This may be so; but the general impression seems to be that they had but <num value="1">one</num> completed on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, and that they expected greater results from that than they have realized.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/> The <rs>Spaniards</rs> are reported to be the most superb boasters that ever existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>The very character of their language, with its long and sonorous words, and its sounding phrases, seems to encourage the spirit of gasconade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>No people can talk so magnificently about small affairs, or utter quibbles in heroics, so naturally, so gracefully, with so much gravity, and with effects so immutably ludicrous.--When speaking of their own achievements, they ascend into the very <num value="7" type="ordinal">seventh</num> heaven of invention, and nothing in fable is so marvellous as what they make out of the simplest occurrences of the day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/> They had peculiar opportunities to indulge this vein during their long war with the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00193" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, and they did not neglect a single <num value="1">one</num> of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>Never since troops <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> trod the field of battle were such prodigies of valor performed; never were such fearful odds so fearlessly encountered; never were such unparalleled victories gained; never such piles of slaughter beheld; never such numbers of trophies and prisoners won from a conquered foe as the <rs>Spanish</rs> generals constantly reported to the <name>Cortez</name>, the <name>Cortez</name> to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and the <rs>English</rs> newspapers to the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>Foreign nations were for a time completely deceived &mdash; for a time believed the <rs>Spanish</rs> soldiers the heroes they represented themselves to be &mdash; and refused to listen to the <rs>French</rs>, who asserted that, so far from performing all these prodigies of valor in very truth, the <rs>Spanish</rs> armies scarcely dared look the bronzed veterans of the <rs>Rhine</rs> and the <rs>Danube</rs> in the face, and invariably fled like sheep whenever dispositions were made to give them the charge. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/> There were many Spanish rhodomontade generals at that day, the least of whom deserved to have his history written by <persName n="Cervantes,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00194" reg="mostcommon:Cervantes,nomatch:0"><surname>Cervantes</surname></persName>, that inimitable master of the ludicrous in action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>The have all had their day, and have been sung by better men than we. &#x0022;But <num value="1">one</num> we would select from that proud throng&#x0022; because of his infinite and inexpressible superiority to all others in that profession, in which they all so far surpassed the rest of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>This is the <rs>Conde de Belvidere</rs>, a young nobleman, who, on <placeName reg="Napoleon, Henry, Ohio" key="tgn,2080924">Napoleon</placeName>'s advance in <dateStruct value="1808--"><year reg="1808">1808</year></dateStruct>, headed that division of the <rs>Spanish</rs> army directly opposed to the column that marched under the orders of <persName n="Soult,Marshal,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00195" reg="mostcommon:Soult,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Marshal">Marshal</roleName> <surname>Soult</surname></persName>.--This division <persName n="Soult,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00196" reg="mostcommon:Soult,nomatch:0"><surname>Soult</surname></persName> found drawn up in order of battle at Gamon&#x00E6;, immediately in front of the ancient town of <placeName key="tgn,7007510;tgn,7002810;tgn,1043675;tgn,1017091;tgn,1140718;tgn,1084075" n="0.004 000000.2480	placename;tgn,7007510;Burgos,Burgos,Castilla-Leon,Espana,Europe,Burgos,Castilla-Leon,Espana,Europe;0.004 000000.2480	placename;tgn,7002810;Burgos,Castilla-Leon,Espana,Europe,Castilla-Leon,Espana,Europe;0.004 000000.2480	placename;tgn,1043675;Burgos,Sassari,Sardegna,Italia,Europe,Sassari,Sardegna,Italia,Europe;0.002 000000.1240	placename;tgn,1017091;Burgos,Tamaulipas,Mexico,North and Central America,Tamaulipas,Mexico,North and Central America;0.002 000000.1030	placename;tgn,1140718;Burgos,Pangasinan,Pilipinas,Asia,Pangasinan,Pilipinas,Asia;0.002 000000.1030	placename;tgn,1084075;Burgos,Tarlac,Pilipinas,Asia,Tarlac,Pilipinas,Asia" reg="Burgos,Burgos,Castilla-Leon,Espana,Europe,Burgos,Castilla-Leon,Espana,Europe;Burgos,Castilla-Leon,Espana,Europe,Castilla-Leon,Espana,Europe;Burgos,Sassari,Sardegna,Italia,Europe,Sassari,Sardegna,Italia,Europe;Burgos,Tamaulipas,Mexico,North and Central America,Tamaulipas,Mexico,North and Central America;Burgos,Pangasinan,Pilipinas,Asia,Pangasinan,Pilipinas,Asia;Burgos,Tarlac,Pilipinas,Asia,Tarlac,Pilipinas,Asia">Burgos</placeName>, which it was its mission to defend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>He thought so little of any resistance it was likely to make that he ordered the attack to be made almost without halting, and certainly without dismounting from the post-horse which he was riding &mdash; for he had travelled fast to overtake his army, and had found it in presence of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>The effect was instantaneous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>The <rs>Spaniards</rs>, to the number of <num value="20000">20,000</num>, threw away their arms, knapsacks, and everything calculated to impede their flight; broke into a <num value="1000">thousand</num> fragments, scattered to all the quarters of the compass, and fled faster than the wild deer of the mountains, <placeName reg="Belvidere, Boone, Illinois" key="tgn,2026547">Belvidere</placeName> himself leading the way, and keeping far in advance of the most fleet- footed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>For <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure> this heroic chief continued to run, and at the end of <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure> he found time to write to the <name>Cortez</name>, and to inform them that he had been attacked by an overwhelming force, had stood his ground for <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure>, slaying a prodigious number of the foe, had then commenced falling slowly back, and had retired, fighting all the way, to the place from which he dated, and which was about <measure n="100miles" type="distance">one hundred miles</measure> from the field of battle!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>At that moment <persName n="Napier,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00197" reg="mostcommon:Napier,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Napier</surname></persName> expressed the belief that there was not a Spanish soldiers within <placeName><distance reg="20miles">twenty miles</distance> of <placeName reg="Belvidere, Boone, Illinois" key="tgn,2026547">Belvidere</placeName></placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/> We said this story could not be surpassed &mdash; and we are sure it could not, at least in <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>But the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> beat the <name>Spaniards</name> as far in romancing as the <name>Spaniards</name> beat the rest of the world.--Here, for instance, is a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> description of the disgraceful flight of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> at <placeName key="tgn,7017708" n="1.000 36" reg="winchester, winchester, virginia">Kernstown</placeName>, in the late action at that place: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/> &#x0022;The battle which was fought at this place lasted all day; that is, the engagement which was here commenced was continued until dark, the enemy in the meantime having, by force of numbers, driven our men to within <placeName><distance reg="6miles">six miles</distance> of <placeName reg="Martinsburg, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119135">Martinsburg</placeName></placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/> &#x0022;Soon after the opening of the engagement, as it promised to be a serious <num value="1">one</num>, the commanding general made every possible preparation to make a stand and fight it out on the spot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>But this was soon found to be impracticable, because no sooner had we formed our lines than the enemy's superiority in numbers gave him the very easy advantage of outflanking us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/> &#x0022;As we, from time to time, changed position, (the firing both with musketry and cannon being at the same time continued with all our effective force,) the enemy moved up. Every possible resistance for each new and further advance was presented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>The rebels fought with great obstinacy, and so did we. They made dash after dash with their cavalry to turn our flanks, but did not succeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>Some of the charges which they made were promptly rendered sportive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>But in <num value="1">one</num> grand charge which they executed, and in which it was estimated that from <num value="20000">twenty</num> to <num value="25000">twenty-five thousand</num> troops participated, we lost heavily in prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>Besides these, we lost either <num value="4">four</num> pieces or a whole battery of artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>This charge decided the work of the day. Our commanders saw they could do nothing against the overwhelming odds against them, and resolved to fall back slowly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/> &#x0022;In the charge referred to, it is true, our lines were for a few minutes broken, during which time the rebels took the prisoners and artillery; but the <rs>Union</rs> troops rallied again, and <orgName n="cavalry"><persName n="Averill,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00198" reg="mostcommon:Averill,nomatch:0"><surname>Averill</surname></persName>'s cavalry</orgName> covered their unwilling retirement. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/> &#x0022;The day's operations closed with each party in line of battle, the rebels advancing with bold front and our men falling back in good and perfect order.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>Our readers have not forgotten the actual occurrences of that conflict &mdash; for <placeName key="tgn,7017708" n="1.000 36" reg="winchester, winchester, virginia">Kernstown</placeName> must be meant, since there has been no other battle in that vicinity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>The cowardly scoundrels fled before our line could be formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>None but our skirmishers came in contact with them, and the skirmishers alone had the honor of routing them, if it can be esteemed an honor to rout such a gang of arrant cowards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>They fled through <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> without looking to the right or left, and with the <rs>Confederates</rs> chasing them, as hounds chase a deer or a hare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>They threw away their weapons, almost to a man, and our troops gathered them in by <num value="1000">thousands</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>Few prisoners were made.
