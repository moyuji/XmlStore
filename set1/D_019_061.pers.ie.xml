<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Called from the quiet and comfort of his home, to meet the fearful crisis impending over the country, he would not now shrink from the labor imposed upon him. After a brief allusion to the part he had taken in the <rs>Government</rs> of the country, and the emotion with which he had heard in his retirement of the tearing asunder of the beautiful flag which had so long waved in triumph, he spoke of the last words of <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> in warning his countrymen against the formation of sectional parties, which had been disregarded by the abolitionists, and the cloud, at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> no bigger than a man's hand, now overshadowed us with gloom.-- The politicians took hold of it, and had succeeded in cutting the ship of State loose from her moorings, and now the fragments were floating in an angry sea, He mourned over it; and when the <name>Legislature</name> called upon him to participate in proceedings for the restoration of the <rs>Union</rs>, he did not feel at liberty to decline the task.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>He read the resolutions of the <name>Legislature</name> embodying the instructions to the <rs>Commissioners</rs>, and remarked that they were instructed thereby to make an effort to restore the <rs>Union</rs> and the <rs>Constitution</rs> as it was; not to make a mere bargain for the interest of the border States He went to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, filled with aspirations for the glory of settling this controversy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>In his address to the <name>Conference</name>, he endeavored to draw around him all the elements composing the body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>He was congratulated with such warmth that he was cheered with hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>But he soon found that the <rs>Northern States</rs> came there with no olive branch to offer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>They had nothing to yield &mdash; nothing to give.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Nevertheless they (himself and colleagues) went to work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The result was, a series of propositions passed by a minority of the <name>Conference</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>He asked what was to be done with it. Did the <rs>Convention</rs> purpose, as it had a right to do, to send it forth to the <name>States</name> for their adoption ? It required <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> of the <name>States</name> to ratify it as an amendment to the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and the idea of obtaining their sanction was preposterous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> politicians could not be made to move an inch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>He alluded to an editorial in the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="National Intelligencer" type="newspaper">National Intelligencer</orgName>,</hi> accusing him of being the cause of preventing the action of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> on this matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>It seemed that everybody loved to attack him. The propositions, he proceeded to say, were composed of <num value="7">seven</num> sections, and each was voted upon separately, and adopted by varying majorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>His colleague, <persName n="Seddon,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Seddon,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seddon</surname></persName>, then asked a vote upon the entire report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>He, as presiding officer, doubted the propriety of this, and the <name>Conference</name> sustained him in his decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Subsequent events had convinced him that he was right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>He was satisfied that the vote of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> did not adopt it as an entirety; and yet the inference was deducible from the remarks of the <hi rend="italics">Intelligencer,</hi> that he gave that decision for the purpose of preventing a vote on the part of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> He then proceeded, after a warm personal compliment to his colleagues who differed with him, to the consideration of the propositions themselves. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> The law of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> had emancipated slavery and substituted peonage; and an emigrant to the territory ceded to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> now goes there surrounded with all the panoply of liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The gentleman from <placeName key="tgn,1125392" n="1.000 13" reg="kanawha, west virginia, united states">Kanawha</placeName> had spoken of the protection of the common law. What protection could the common law give you on that soil, where the bondman has been emancipated ? In this connection he gave illustrations of conflicting opinions in decisions of the common law, showing that the opinion of <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Stowell</foreName></persName> conflicted with that of <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Mansfield</foreName></persName>, quoted by the gentleman from <placeName key="tgn,1125392" n="1.000 13" reg="kanawha, west virginia, united states">Kanawha</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="8Section">eighth section</orgName> of the <rs>Chicago Platform</rs> was then read to show how common law was to be administered, by a Federal <rs type="role2">Judge</rs> appointed by <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.--What protection had we, then, to expect ? It would, like the apples of the <rs type="place">Dead Sea</rs>, fall to ashes the moment you get it in your grasp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>It was said the other day that we didn't want any more territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Yes; you may have territory enough, but it is territory in the moon, to which you can never get, for you are hedged off by the <orgName type="regiment" key="2Section">second section</orgName> of the <orgName n="Peace Conference" type="conference">Peace Conference</orgName> propositions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The right of transit is denied to our property.--Every day the mechanics of the <rs>North</rs> are passing along with their property, but we poor starvelings are to be denied that privilege.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>How will you get to <placeName reg="New Mexico" key="tgn,7007565">New Mexico</placeName> ?--Would you go by sea ?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Suppose you take it by land ?-- You want to migrate from <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> to the <rs type="place">Territory</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing that arrests you is <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>; the next, <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>And there you are, with an immense grant of land, but unable to get to it. But we were told that we were told that we had a plenty of land to fill up for a <measure n="100years" type="date">hundred years</measure> to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Are you willing to remain without expansion--<num value="7">seven</num> States in this Northern Confederacy, with <num value="19">nineteen</num> against you, and the numbers to be vastly increased during the present Administration ? He was surprised to hear such an argument on this floor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>If gentlemen were satisfied with that state of things, he had nothing to complain of; he differed with them, and that was sufficient. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> alluded to He next the resolution of the <name>Legislature</name>, proposing the <name>Crittenden</name> proposition, somewhat amended, as the basis of the <rs>Commissioners</rs>' action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>His honorable friend from <placeName key="tgn,1125392" n="1.000 13" reg="kanawha, west virginia, united states">Kanawha</placeName> had taken ground indicating a willingness to be contented without the acquisition of future territory. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>So far as fugitive slaves are concerned, it is rare that a slaveholder can retake his fugitive now, except at a greater cost than it is worth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>With some exceptions a successful escape is final, unless, as is sometimes the case, the fugitive, discovering that his new lot is full of hardships, chooses himself to return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>In regard to the suppression of insurrections, no such assistance is necessary, nor, if it were, could it be rendered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>The <orgName n="U. S. Army" type="org">Army of the United States</orgName>, small at best, is scattered over an immense extent of territory, and cannot be concentrated in time to be of service in any such emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>Moreover, the history of the world affords few examples of successful insurrections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>The present generation has before its own eyes the instructive instance of the manner in which a few <num value="1000">thousand</num> <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs> held all <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName> in subjection, and of the thorough and complete triumph, in the late memorable <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName> mutiny, of <num value="20000">20,000</num> <name>English</name> soldiers over an admirably disciplined army of <num value="200000">200,000</num> Sepoys, abundantly supplied with arms and munitions of war, and backed by the moral, if not material, aid and comfort of <num value="150000000">150,000,000</num> of subject people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>It is absurd, therefore, to talk of the dominant race in the <rs>Southern States</rs>, dominant in numbers as well as blood, and all accustomed to the use of arms, being dependent for their safety upon the army of any Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>Moreover, the inferior race in the <rs>Southern States</rs> are, in general, contented and loyal, and, as we see in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, not only faithful to their masters, but absolutely aiding to fight against the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>The intelligent among their number fully understand that the real object of the abolitionists is not to help the negroes, but to drive them out, and put white men in their places. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>The truth is, the interests of the <rs>North</rs>, as well as the removal of the agitating cause of slavery from Northern politics, would, in the event of secession, render slave property safer in the <rs>Border States</rs> than it has been for the last quarter of a century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>We had great political writers in the olden time, but there are not many who care to read their works from title page to colophon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>Of the few <rs>Virginia</rs> written books which we can read with unwearied interest, we are not ashamed to confess that the <name>Life</name> of <hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>,</hi> by <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Weems,Mason,L.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00228" reg="default:Weems,L.,,,"><roleName n="Mason">Mason</roleName> <foreName>L.</foreName> <surname>Weems</surname></persName>,</hi> and the <name>Life</name> of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Marion,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00229" reg="mostcommon:Marion,nomatch:0"><surname>Marion</surname></persName>,</hi> by the same author, are among our favorites.--People tell us of books for children, and they give us books full of baby-talk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>The child, we believe, by the time he learns to read, has no taste for any such books.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>He likes something stirring &mdash; something animated-- something full of action &mdash; it may be the action of grown men or giants, but not of children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>Not large boys, but little fellows of <num value="9">nine</num> or <num value="10">ten</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>But of all books, the most captivating to a Virginia boy, is the <name>Life</name> of <hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>,</hi> with its wood cuts, <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Braddock,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00236" reg="mostcommon:Braddock,nomatch:0"><surname>Braddock</surname></persName> </hi> and the <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indians</rs>, <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><foreName>Cornwallis</foreName></persName></hi> and the <rs>British</rs> army, <hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName></hi> and the <rs n="Hessian" type="ethnic">Hessians</rs>, &#x0026;c.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/> If asked to give a reason for this strange preference, we should be totally at a loss to do it. The book is, certainly, a very ridiculous book, in all the lights that are generally supposed to make a book respectable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>The language is the ludicrous jargon in which any man ever conveyed his ideas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>The style is unlike any style that ever man wrote or spoke in. There is scarcely an idea that is not tame and common place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>There is nothing so serious that he does not make us laugh at it. There is nothing so imposing that he does not render it ridiculous.--The very slaughter of the battle-field, the very groans of the wounded, the very grief of the bereaved, become subjects of laughter under his treatment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>Yet little boys gloat over it, big boys dream about it, grown men read it, laugh at it, and read it again and again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>Ask them why they read such intolerable stuff, and they cannot tell you. They profess the utmost contempt for it, and yet they go on reading it, to the end of the chapter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/> The nearest approach we can make to a reason for this unaccountable infatuation is this: The man tells his story in his own way. The style is his own, the language is his own, and the sentiments are his own. If he attempts to be fine, it is after his own fashion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>He borrows from nobody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>What he tells us may be told in homely phrase; but be it as homely as it may, it is his own. It is natural even where it is turgid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>Others may laugh, but he is in earnest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>Others may see that he is making a fool of himself, but he never suspects anything of the kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>From this results a strong sense of reality, which is observable throughout the book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>In the most trifling incidents of his hero's childhood, as well as in the most momentous passages of his extraordinary life, we feel as though we were present, and witnesses to all. It is the simple tale of a child, telling what he knows with all the simplicity of childhood.

It was a memorable day with us--<num value="1">one</num> which we shall never forget.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>It was the day of an election, when elections used to be held on the <dateStruct value="-04-"><month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct> <placeName reg="County Court">County Court</placeName> days, long before the <rs>Convention</rs> of <dateStruct value="1829--"><year reg="1829">1829</year></dateStruct>-&#x0027;<num value="30">30</num> fixed all upon the same day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>We had heretofore entertained a secret belief, that a blacksmith's shop in the neighborhood, which we had been allowed, occasionally, to visit, was the emporium of civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>We had been told that the <rs type="place">Court-House</rs> was a superior place, but we doubted it greatly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>To the election, however, we went, and there, among other strange sights, we saw an old man sitting behind a table, under a large oak tree, with a pile of books before him. We were told that was the renowned &#x0022;<rs type="role">Rector</rs> of <placeName reg="Mount Vernon, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111632">Mount Vernon</placeName> parish&#x0022; (so he wrote himself) --that was <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Weems,Mason,L.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00249" reg="default:Weems,L.,,,"><roleName n="Mason">Mason</roleName> <foreName>L.</foreName> <surname>Weems</surname></persName></hi>--that was the man who wrote the life of <hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>!</hi> We had read the book until we had worn it out. We had never thought it would be our fortune to see the author.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>We had thought that a man who could write a book, must be something more than mortal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>We gazed in stupid admiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>We wish we could admire anything whatever, now, as much as we admired that old man. We dared not speak to him. We were too much awe struck for that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>We could but gaze in stupid wonder, as a Chinaman gazes on his Idol, when he is &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">Chin-Chinning Josh.</hi>&#x0022; Nothing could divert our attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>There were cakes and gingerbread around, and we had <measure n="0.5dollars" type="currency">a half dollar</measure> to buy. There were sheriffs and deputies calling the sovereigns to go to the polls, and they were crowding up in swarms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>There were bullies fighting for they knew not what, and they were surrounded by their friends.
