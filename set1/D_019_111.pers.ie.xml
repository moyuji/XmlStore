<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>It is charged in this order that <num value="1">one</num> of the soldiers <q>&#x0022;has been poisoned by means of strychnine administered in the food brought into the camp&#x0022;</q> by the <q>&#x0022;venders of supplies&#x0022;</q> who have been permitted to visit it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/> The braggart proceedings of the <rs>North</rs> only provoke the contempt and resentment of our people; but there are some occurrences there which fall upon the <rs>Southern</rs> heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>Among these is the enlistment of foreign regiments to wage an unrighteous war of aggression upon Southern liberty and independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>The South cannot help recurring to the events of <dateStruct value="1854--"><year reg="1854">1854</year></dateStruct> and <dateStruct value="1855--"><year reg="1855">1855</year></dateStruct>, when the same spirit of malignant and fanatical intolerance which is now let loose upon herself, was waging a cruel and remorseless war upon the foreign exile and the unoffending <rs n="Catholic" type="religion">Catholic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>The fires of proscription swept over the whole of that bigoted section; and in every city, village and hamlet, men met in secret conclave, with stealthy step in the small hours of the night, to swear by their duty to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and country an eternal hostility to the foreigner and the <rs n="Catholic" type="religion">Catholic</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/> In the fury of their malignant and proscriptive fanaticism, and with the boldness that a controlling secret organization imparted, they contented themselves not with victories won everywhere by the ballot-box, but they proceeded to violence, in the burning of cathedrals and convents, and in mob attacks upon congregations and individuals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>Nay, under a pretense of public virtue, which thinly disguised a vulgar curiosity and licentious inquisitiveness, they violated the seclusion of schools and the sanctity of convents and sisterhoods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>They sought to degrade the foreigner, however intelligent, to a lower political level than the free negro, and to deny rights and franchises to the exemplary <rs n="Catholic" type="religion">Catholic</rs>, which they conceded to the polygamous <rs n="Mormon" type="religion">Mormon</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>The thirsty sands of the desert do not drink up the showers from the clouds with more avidity than the <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> bigotry of the <rs>North</rs> welcomed the dogmas of Know-Nothingism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>Suddenly the vulgarest skulks of the streets became leaders in politics and the dispensatories of public patronage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>The foreigner felt himself under the ban of the polls and of the <rs>Government</rs>, and the <rs n="Catholic" type="religion">Catholic</rs> listened for insult in every sound that came to his ears. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/> It was while staggering under this thrall of intolerance and proscription that the <rs n="Catholic" type="religion">Catholic</rs> and the foreigner heard of a championship of his cause which he as little expected as a miracle from Heaven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>It was precisely in the section where his religion was least disseminated and his race most sparse, that this championship of free conscience and equal rights arose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>It was in the land of the generous and chivalrous Cavalier, a land where toleration was not only a principle but an emotion, where hospitality was not merely a habit but an inheritance, that the indignant voice of rebuke was raised against the mean and base spirit of Know-Nothingism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/><placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> was then as now, the battle-ground between the champions of constitutional liberty and the fool fiend of bigotry and intolerance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>He reports a pretty large force <unclear></unclear> not so large, however, he has been reported out that it is daily being augmented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>He says it is impossible to tell how many troops there are in the neighborhood of <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>, but from information from reliable parties there are not more than <num value="4000">four thousand</num> at next point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>He saw and conversed with a gentleman, who said he was <unclear></unclear>, and who is furnishing the rebel troops with bread. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/> The Government will undoubtedly soon put stop to the furnishing of supplies, and also set off the military road leading to <placeName reg="Baltimore Independent City, Maryland, United States" key="tgn,7021987">Baltimore city</placeName>. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/> The Administration, some time ago, notified the <rs>British Government</rs> that it would be compiled owing to the existing condition of affairs to withdraw most of its squadron, for a time at least, from the <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>The British Government has, it is understood, determined to augment their squadron in those <unclear>ters</unclear> thereby not only aiding our Government, but relieving it of the necessity of keeping a large squadron there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>They were aware that all the vessels of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Navy would be required for home protection.

<head>Suggestions to soldiers.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/> In an ordinary campaign sickness disables or destroys <num value="3">three</num> times as many as the sword. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/> On a march, from, <dateStruct><month>April</month></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct>, the entire clothing should be a colored flannel shirt, with a loosely buttoned collar, cotton drawers, woolen pantaloons, shoes and stockings, and a light-colored felt hat, with broad brim to protect the eyes and face from the glare of the sun and from the rain, and a substantial but not heavy coat when off duty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/> Sun-stroke is most effectually prevented by wearing a silk handkerchief in the crown of the hat. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/> Colored blankets are best, and if lined with brown drilling the warmth and durability are doubled, while the protection against dampness from lying on the ground is almost complete. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/> Never lie or sit down on the grass or bare earth for a moment; rather use your hat &mdash; a handkerchief, even, is a great protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/>The warmer you are the greater need for this protection, as a damp vapor is immediately generated, to be absorbed by the clothing, and to cool you off too rapidly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/> While marching, or on other active duty, the more thirsty you are the more essential is it to safety of life itself to rinse out the mouth <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> times, and <hi rend="italics">then</hi> take a swallow of water at a time, with short intervals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>A brave French General, on a forced march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>fell dead on the instant by drinking largely of cold water, when snow was on the ground. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/> Abundant sleep is essential to bodily efficiency, and to that alertness of mind which is all important in an engagement; and few things more certainly and more effectually prevent sound sleep than eating heartily after sundown, especially after a heavy march or desperate battle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/> Nothing is more certain to secure endurance and capability of long-continued effort, than the avoid once of everything as a drink except cold water, not excluding coffee at breakfast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/>Drink as little as possible of even cold water. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/> After any sort of exhausting effort, a cup of coffee, hot or cold, is an admirable sustainer <unclear></unclear> strength, until nature begins to recover herself. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/> never eat heartily just before a great undertaking; because the nervous power is irresistibly drawn to the stomach to manage the food eaten, thus drawing off that supply which the brain and muscle so much need. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/> If persons will drink brandy, it is incomparably safer to do so <hi rend="italics">after</hi> an effort than before; for it can give only a transient strength, lasting but a few minutes; but as it can never be known how long any given effort is to be kept in continuance, and if longer than the few minutes the body becomes more feeble than it would have been without the stimulus, it is clear that its use <hi rend="italics">before</hi> an effort is always hazardous and is always unwise. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/> Never go to sleep, especially after a great effort, even in hot weather, without some covering over you. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/> Under all circumstances, rather than lie down on the bare ground, lie in the hollow of <num value="2">two</num> logs placed together, or across several smaller pieces of wood, laid side by side; or sit on your hat, leaning against a tree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>A nap olden or <measure n="15minutes" type="date">fifteen minutes</measure> in that position will refresh you more than an hour on the bare earth, with the additional advantage of perfect safety. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/> A <hi rend="italics">cut</hi> is less dangerous than a bullet wound and heals more rapidly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/> If from any wound the blood spurts out in jets, instead of a steady stream, you will die in a few minutes unless it is unless it is remedied; because an artery has been divided, and that takes the blood direct from the fountain of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>To stop this instantly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>tie a handkerchief or other cloth very loosely between the wound and the heart; put a stick, bayonet, or ramrod <hi rend="italics">between</hi> the skin and the handkerchief, and twist around until the bleeding ceases, and keep it thus until the surgeon arrives. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/> If the blood flows in a slow, regular stream, a vein has been pierced, and the handkerchief must be on the other side of the wound from the heart &mdash; that is, <hi rend="italics">below</hi> the wound. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/> A bullet through the abdomen (belly or stomach) is more certainly fatal than if aimed at the head or heart; for in the latter cases the bill is often glanced off by the bone, or follows round it under the skin; but when it enters the stomach or bowels, from any direction, death is inevitable under all conceivable circumstances, but is scarcely ever instantaneous. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/> Let the whole beard grow, but not longer than some <measure n="3inches" type="distance">three inches</measure>. This strengthens and thickens its growth, and thus makes a more perfect protection for the lungs against dust, and of the throat against winds and cold in winter, while in the summer a greater perspiration of the skin is induced, with an increase of evaporation; hence greater coolness of the paris on the outside, while the throat is less feverish, thirsty, and dry. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/> A void sats and fat meat in summer and all warm days. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/> Whenever possible, take a plunge into any lake or running stream every morning as soon as you get up. If none at hand, endeavor to wash the body all over as soon as you leave your bed, for cleanliness acts like a charm against all diseases, always either warding them off altogether, or greatly mitigating their severity and shortening their duration. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/> Keep the hair of the head closely cut, say within an inch and <num value="0.5">a half</num> of the scalp in every part, repeated on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of each mouth, and wash the whole scalp plentifully in cold water every morning. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/> Wear woolen stockings and moderately loose shoes, keeping the toe and finger nails always cut close. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/> It is more important to wash the feet well every night than to wash the face and hands of mornings, because it aids in keeping the skin and nails soft, and to prevent chafing, blisters and corns, all of which greatly interfere with a soldier's duty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/> The most universally safe position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>after all stunning, hurts and wounds, is that of being placed on the back, the head being elevated <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4inches" type="distance">four inches</measure> only, aiding more than any on thing else can do to equalize and restore the proper circulation of the blood. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/> The more weary you are after a march or other work, the more easily will you take cold, if you remain still after it is over, unless the moment you cease motion you throw a coat or blanket over your shoulders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>This precaution should be taken in the warmest weather, especially if there is even a slight air stirring. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/> The greatest physical kindness you can show a severely-wounded comrade, is first to place him on his back, and then run with all your might for some water to drink.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/>Not a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> ought to be lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/>If no vessel is at hand, take your hat; if no hat, off with your shirt, wring it out at once, tie the arms in a knot, as also the lower end, thus making a big, open at the neck only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>A fleet person can convey a bucket full half a mile in this way. I've seen a dying man clutch at a single drop of water from the finger's end, with the voraciousness of a famished tiger. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/> If wet to the skin by rain or by swimming rivers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/>keep in motion until the clothes are dried, and no harm will result. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/> Whenever it is possible, do, by all means, when you have to use water for cooking or drinking from ponds or sluggish streams, boll it well, and when cool shake it, or stir it, so that the oxygen of the air shall get to ti, which greatly improves it for drinking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>This boiling arrests the process of fermentation which arises from the presence of organic and inorganic impurities, thus tending to prevent cholera and all bowel diseases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/>If there is no time for boiling, at least strain it through a cloth, even if you have to use a shirt or trouser leg. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/> <num value="12">Twelve</num> men are hit in battle dressed in red where there are only <num value="5">five</num> dressed in a bluish grey&#x0022;a difference of more than <num value="2">two</num> to <num value="1">one</num>; green, <num value="7">seven</num>; brown, <num value="6">six</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/> Water can be made almost ice cool in the hottest weather by closely enveloping a filled canteen, or other vessel, with woolen cloth, kept plentifully wetted and exposed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/> While on a march lie down the moment you halt for rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/>Every minute spent in that position refreshes more than <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure> standing or loitering about. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/> A daily evacuation of the bowels is indispensable to bodily health, vigor and endurance; this is promoted in many cases by stirring a tablespoonful of corn (<rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs>) meal in a glass of water, and drinking it on rising in the morning. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
