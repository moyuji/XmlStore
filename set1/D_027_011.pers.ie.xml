<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> To those whose avocation it is to chronicle, for the benefit of the world at large, a record of passing events, yesterday presented difficulties of no ordinary magnitude; for not a solitary rumor floated upon the heated atmosphere from &#x0022;early morn to dewy-eyed,&#x0022; nor did there an event transpire, so far as we could ascertain, to interrupt the monotony of the campaign in the vicinity of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Passengers by the train from <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, in the evening, brought the usual report--&#x0022;everything quiet&#x0022;--and we could only learn that the enemy practiced a little with artillery merely to let our troops know that he was still in our front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/><placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, for the time being, has almost ceased to be a point of interest, and all eyes are now turned towards the <rs>Northern</rs> border.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The accounts from that section are derived exclusively from <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> sources, and we publish them <hi rend="italics">in extensor</hi> elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>It is evident from these that the enemy has received a terrible fright, and though we are is the dark as to the magnitude or the object of the expedition, except through what we gather from the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> themselves, the results may have an important bearing upon the issue of this campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>A letter from <persName n="Winchester,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Winchester,nomatch:0"><surname>Winchester</surname></persName>, of recent date, says the inhabitants were entirely unaware of the advance of a Confederate force until they heard the guns at <placeName reg="Leetown, Frederick, Virginia" key="tgn,7023231">Leetown</placeName>, so quietly had the movement been conducted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> Meanwhile, the <num value="6" type="ordinal">Sixth</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName> has taken its departure from the insalubrious intitude of <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName></persName>, and gone (probably) to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The opinion is still expressed that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> is making preparations to change his base, but it is purely conjectural, and we hear nothing to confirm such a supposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>It seems to be his policy to make no attack upon our lines at present, and he can thus spare a portion of his army to operate on Northern soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>It is not reasonable, however, to suppose that he entertains the idea of abandoning entirely the position he now holds in front of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> until he is forced to do so. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> It is now a well ascertained fact that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> has greatly contracted his lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>After repeated efforts to extend his left flank around to <orgName n="Reams Station" type="station">Reams's Station</orgName>, he has now withdrawn it to the east of the plankroad, from whence his lines extend to the vicinity of <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The enemy has robbed the people of <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName></persName> of everything that could contribute to the support of life, and it is stated that many hitherto wealthy families of the county are now drawing rations of hard tack and salt pork from the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> commissary. </p> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have resorted to a novel method of supplying themselves with water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>They have dug a canal from the <rs>Appomattox</rs> to a hospital camp, about <placeName><distance reg="2miles">two miles</distance> from <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName></placeName>, and by means of a fire engine, brought from <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, they pump water from this ditch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>It is also believed that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, for some time past, has been detaching and sending off parts of the other corps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The cry is no longer &#x0022;On to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>,&#x0022; but the &#x0022;Capital is in danger.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time> last an effort was made by our side to bring on a fight, but without avail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>At <time value="5oclock">five o'clock</time> a heavy fire from our artillery was opened on the enemy's lines, and our men simultaneously mounted the earthworks and defied the enemy to advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>This they declined but replied briskly with artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Nothing was effected, and nobody was hurt. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/> A just pride in the past is an incentive to virtue both in a family and a State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>We are not speaking of the pride of noble descent, for that is a weakness which nations of the middle classes have no temptation to.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/> History will secure them a national heirloom such as no other civilized nation can boast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>We know how they falsify history, but there will be other annalists of these times than <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> writers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>So great a political convulsion as this cannot be ignored even if they were so disposed, by the philosophers and historians of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> may be sure that the process of preserving them and their deeds for the eye of posterity has already begun in every centre of the world's civilization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>The cruelties, robberies, rapes, murders, and every variety of crime perpetrated in the war, will be daguerreotyped to the minutest detail for the astonishment and horror of future ages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>Even among themselves when the passion of this outburst of hell has subsided, historians will arise of that minority in the <rs>United</rs> which is now kept down by the bayonet, but which has always loathed and abominated <persName><foreName>Puritanism</foreName></persName>, and will hang pictures upon their walls which future generations will shudder to look at. Yes, a day is coming when books will be opened in both earth and Heaven, and they that read therein will tremble. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/> Their children will have another heirloom in the wreck of the old Republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>The greatest glory of their present generation is that they descended from the men of '<num value="76">76</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>The unspeakable shame of their next generation will be their descent from the men of this infamous era. Their fathers inherited a republic and bequeathed to them a despotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>They were heirs to a magnificent territory, and by their own violence and wrong transmitted only some worthless fragments to their posterity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>Never did a race receive from its sires such a legacy of disgrace and ruin as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> of this day are preparing for their descendants. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/> There will be family heirlooms too, no doubt, though possibly these may afford some consolation to the offspring of a race of brigands and robbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>Rich dresses, carefully preserved, which inquiring posterity will be informed were pilfered from the wardrobes of helpless Southern ladies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>Rings upon their fingers which the mother will relate with pride were torn from the fingers of a wicked female &#x0022;secesh.&#x0022; Silver plate sparkling upon the sideboard, which their brave fathers stole from the houses and churches of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>Chairs, tables, bedsteads, work stands, guitars, pianos, which came into the family by a process <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> that ordinarily sends the perpetrators in the whipping-post and penitentiary. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/> A glorious future will these men bequeath to their descendants!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>What care they?-- &#x0022;Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.&#x0022; That is their motto.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>But they cannot die, except the death of the putrid ear case, which Confederate bullets are rapidly ridding the earth of. They must live in an immortality of infamy in this world, and in the next receive the due reward of their deeds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>Well would it be for them and their posterity if their reputations and their souls could perish with their bodies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>They must live, live forever in this world, in the reproach of all mankind and their children's shame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>In rapine, robbery, and murder they are publishing their own history, illustrating the <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> pedigree, and fabricating a poisoned shirt which will cling to their children and their children's children. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
