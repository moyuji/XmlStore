<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>He describes them as being cut all to pieces, and he has no doubt that many more were thus mangled, but he was not allowed to witness them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>They then told him that he must take the oath of allegiance never to fight against the <rs>North</rs>, assuring him if this was not agreed to he would be put upon <orgName n="Newport News" type="newspaper">Newport News</orgName>, and made to fight anyhow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>Certainly it did not occur to me that a paltry partisan spirit could so far pervade the legislative halls of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> as to cause the gentlemen assembled there to forget the respect due to the <orgName n="Executive Office" type="office">Executive office</orgName>, in a lanatical desire to prop up, by such support, the unholy cause of treason against the <rs>General Government</rs>. </p>

On turning the curve slowly, when within <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a mile of <placeName reg="Vienna, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2114749">Vienna</placeName>, we were fired upon by a raking masked battery of, <unclear></unclear> think, <num value="3">three</num> guns, with shells, round shot and grape, killing and wounding the men on the platform and in the cars, before the train could be stopped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>When the train was stopped the engineer could not, on account of the damage done to some part of the running machinery, draw the train out of the range of the enemy's fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>The engine being in the rear, we left the cars and retreated to the right and left of the train through the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>Finding that the enemy's batteries were sustained by what appeared to be about a regiment of Infantry, and by Cavalry, which force we have since understood to have been some <num value="1500">1,500</num> South <rs n="Carolinian" type="group">Carolinians</rs>, we fell back along the railroad, throwing out skirmishers on both flanks. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/> This was about <time value="7pm">7 o'clock P.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/> The engineer, when the men left the cars, instead of retiring slowly, as I ordered, detached his engine with the passenger car, from the rest of the disabled train, and abandoned us, running to <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>, and we have heard nothing from him since.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>Thus we were deprived of a rallying point, and of all means of accompanying the wounded, who had to be carried on litters and in blankets.--We wait here, holding the road for reinforcements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>The enemy did not pursue. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/> I have ascertained that the enemy's force at <placeName reg="Fairfax Court-House">Fairfax Court-House</placeName>, <placeName><distance reg="4miles">four miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Vienna, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2114749">Vienna</placeName></placeName>, is now about <num value="4000">4,000</num> strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>When all the batteries were opened upon us, <persName n="Hughey,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00300" reg="mostcommon:Hughey,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Hughey</surname></persName> was at his station on the foremost platform car. <persName n="McCook,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00301" reg="mostcommon:McCook,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>McCook</surname></persName> was with me in <num value="1">one</num> of the passenger cars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>Both of these officers, with others of the commissioned officers and many of the men, behaved most coolly under this galling fire, which we could not return, and from batteries which we could not flank or turn, owing to the nature of the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>The approach to <placeName reg="Vienna, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2114749">Vienna</placeName> is through a deep, long cut in the railway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>On leaving the cars and before they could rally, many of my men lost their haversacks or blankets, but brought off all their muskets, except, it may be, a few that were destroyed by the enemy's <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> fire, or lost with those who were killed. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>A consultation was held on the cars, and some of the officers urged that discretion was the better part of valor, while others maintained that they could whip them anyhow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>It was determined to proceed, and when the train got in sight of the battery, of the existence of which no <num value="1">one</num> on it (the train) knew anything, the brakes were instantly put down hard to stop as quickly as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>The whole regiment left <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName> upon the expedition, which was designed to leave a strong guard upon the railroad all the way to <placeName reg="Vienna, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2114749">Vienna</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>This they presume will have the effect of bringing into the field a large Federal force, before which the insurgents design to retreat along a lane which has been cut through the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>On both sides of this lane, which is about <measure n="15feet" type="distance">fifteen feet</measure> wide, have been constructed a number of masked batteries, which are to open their fire in every direction when the <rs>Federal</rs> troops have penetrated the forest so far as to render a retreat impossible. </p> </q><bibl n="New York Tribune"></bibl></cit> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/>what a spectacle for angels and saints! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/> We left <num value="8">eight</num> negro men in charge of our camp; but as it was just in the rear of the centre of the battle, the balls and shells tell so thick and fast about their heads that <num value="1">one</num> of them leaped upon his mule and rode <q>&#x0022;for death and life&#x0022;</q> till he reached <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>, <measure n="15miles" type="distance">15 miles</measure> off.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="951"/>On our right was a field, in which there was a herd of cattle feeding, and I cannot convey to your readers the terror written in their faces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>A lion in hot pursuit could not have alarmed them more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/>They seemed to know not where to fly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="954"/>What a sad commentary upon our humanity!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="955"/>The implements invented for man's destruction terrify brutish beasts, and send them howling from their coverts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="956"/>But our poor nature is full of contradictons and extremes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="957"/>Our comfortable condition now reminds me of this contrariety, and I wish to inform our friends in your city how highly we appreciate their liberality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="958"/>We have ceased, thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, to erect tents of brushwood, which only protect us from the sun. Last Sabbath afternoon, as the clouds gathered thick and black in the <rs>East</rs>, and the thunder muttered in the distance, we looked with satisfaction to our tents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="959"/>They lay in the valley, skirted by green trees, and shone in the evening light in all their new-made whiteness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="960"/>Night came on, the winds blew, the rain descended, and beat upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="961"/>We had gone to rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="962"/>Our <rs n="oil cloths" type="product">oil-cloths</rs> lay near by, lest our tents should disappoint us. But as the rain beat upon our humble but secure dwellings, the sense of comfort experienced by our nearness to the pelting rain, and our security from it, brought our safety more strikingly to our minds, and we stretched ourselves with great satisfaction upon our blankets, and in our inmost hearts blessed our kind friends for their liberality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="963"/>Had we needed any additional inspiration to spend our days and nights in the fields and woods, this reflection would have supplied it. But our cause is so good, so just, so holy, that, it need be, we would willingly fight for it day and night, in storm and tempest, without shelter, and even without sympathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="964"/>But of this latter incentive there is no lack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="965"/>I am very sure, and I will take the liberty here to suggest that those who stay at home could not show their sympathy for their brethern in the field in any way so substantially as in sheltering them from the weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="966"/>By this means they will show their love for their friends, and also manifest their devotion to their country, in this her hour of need.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="967"/>We have been engaged this morning in naming our tents after those kind friends who took the most active part in procuring them for us. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="998"/> The following remarks on the interesting subjects suggested in the title of this article, are from the pen of a Southern gentleman who is especially well qualified to write upon them: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="999"/> &#x0022;Few of your readers are aware of the immense loss of Southern wealth incident to the transportation of the cotton crop to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> in the present &#x0027;raw&#x0027; or &#x0027;lint&#x0027; form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1000"/>It is sent forward as a colonial product to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, where it is spun into yarn (or thread,) and then re-exported to the continent of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, to <placeName reg="Bharat" key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName>, <placeName reg="Zhonghua" key="tgn,1000111">China</placeName>, and <placeName reg="South River, Rockbridge, Virginia" key="tgn,2681713">South</placeName> <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs>, in immense quantities, and with a corresponding enhancement in value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1001"/>It is the cotton but which makes valuable the coal and front of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1002"/>The great industry of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> is the cotton spinning industry, and in this branch of manufacturing the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> are yet destined to supplant all rivals </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1003"/> &#x0022;<placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, are capable of becoming the cotton- spinners of the world and we may yet live to see the day when a bale-of-lint' cotton offered for export to a foreign or coastwise port, will be as great a curiosity as is now a bale of cotton in the seed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1004"/>It the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> cotton crop were shipped in the shape of yarn or thread, it would make a saving to our national wealth in the items of waste and transportation alone of <num value="0.25">25 per cent</num> on the total crop, or say <num value="50000000">fifty millions</num> of dollars &mdash; a sum sufficient to construct the <orgName n="Pacific Railroad" type="railroad">Pacific Railroad</orgName>, and cut a ship canal across <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1008"/>But, like all great improvements, original ideas are seized by practical minds and turned into account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1009"/>The idea of shipping the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> cotton crop in the form of &#x0027;yarn&#x0027; or &#x0027;thread&#x0027; is now receiving the earnest attention of practical men in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, <placeName reg="Germany" key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> and <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1010"/>It is a great measure, and <num value="1">one</num> possessing a vast amount of interesting detail, which we may take occasion hereafter to make the subject of special attention in this paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1011"/>Everything calculated to develop <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> industry possesses an interest for us, and we are always particularly gratified when we see the <rs>Southern States</rs> turning their attention to the immense resources so lavishly bestowed upon them by the bountiful hand of Nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1012"/>We therefore wish the direct trade movement of the <rs>South</rs> that measure of success to which every fair commercial enterprise is entitled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1013"/>If the cotton crop can be spun into thread by the <rs>Atlantic Southern States</rs>, it furnishes another bond of unity between the <name>States</name> of the <rs>South</rs>, and is another stride in power taken by &#x0027;<persName><roleName n="King">King</roleName> <foreName>Cotton</foreName></persName>&#x0027; <q>&#x0022;In this connection we think it proper to allude to the fact, that the <name>Surat</name> or <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> cottons are valueless except when used with the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> staple.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1014"/>By yielding the monopoly of spinning up our crop to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, we have enabled her gradually to introduce the <name>Surat</name> cotton into the continental markets, until now we find that over <measure n="700000barrels" type="mass">seven hundred thousand bales</measure> of Surats are placed anually in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1016"/>The consequence of this policy is now manifest at <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1017"/>The lower grades of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> cottons are not asked for, the <rs>English</rs> spinners having worked in the <name>India</name> cotton, and nearly <measure n="600000barrels" type="mass">six hundred thousand bales</measure> are in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> without buyers, and depreciating daily in value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1018"/>Does any <num value="1">one</num> doubt that if these <measure n="600000barrels" type="mass">six hundred thousand bales</measure> had been spun into thread in <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName> they would have been preferred by the <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs>, <persName><foreName>Swiss</foreName></persName>, or <name>French</name> weaver to the flimsy &#x0027;<persName n="Surat,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00430" reg="mostcommon:Surat,nomatch:0"><surname>Surat</surname></persName>&#x0027; thread they are forced to take from <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>?
