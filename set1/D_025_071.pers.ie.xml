<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>It is true that he made a bad start, but then it must be recollected that the habit of retreating has become so natural to our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> in that quarter of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> that they seem to think it the greatest accomplishment of an officer to be able to make a skillful retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>Let us hope that the fame he has earned in that line of business is sufficient to satisfy him and that he now desires to achieve renown of another description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>If he is determined to fight, we see not what is to prevent him from beating his adversary, if, as he says, he has been largely reinforced. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>The probability is that he would never reach the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> States again except as a captive. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/> P. S.--Since the above was written the intelligence published in another column informs us that the great struggle for <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> has begun.
