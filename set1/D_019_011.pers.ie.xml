<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The troops had been notified <measure n="14hours" type="date">fourteen hours</measure> in advance of the expected arrival of the steamer, and arrangements had been made to signal her. The account says: </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="2"> 
<head>Scene in the city.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> Early in the morning, between the hours of <num value="6">six</num> and <num value="7">seven</num>, the city was intensely excited at the expected reports of heavy ordnance in the harbor. &#x0022;The <orgName n="Star of the West" type="newspaper">Star of the West</orgName>,&#x0022; was the <sic>ex</sic> exclamation of all. &#x0022;<num value="1">One</num>,&#x0022; &#x0022;<num value="2">two</num>,&#x0022; &#x0022;<num value="3">three</num>,&#x0022; &#x0022;<num value="4">four</num>,&#x0022; guns &mdash; the contest is begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>In a few minutes people from all parts of the city came from their houses, and were seen rushing out to the water's edge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The streets were soon thronged with eager men, hurrying towards the <rs type="place">Battery</rs> and the wharves to ascertain all that could be learned of the noise made by the guns in the offing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The cannon, as long as they were discharged, went off in regular, deliberate succession, clearly evincing that in serving them the utmost military precision had been attained, and reflected great credit upon those managing them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> With the naked eye nothing of what was going on in the harbor could be discovered, and consequently the most intense excitement prevailed to find out what had caused the cessation of reports after <num value="17">seventeen</num> or <num value="18">eighteen</num> had been discharged. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> It was not until half an hour or so that the populace, by this time fully aroused to the importance of the movement evidently made by our troops, was put in possession of the facts of the affair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>In the meantime, crowds of people had gathered in the most convenient localities, for procuring information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The bulletin boards of the newspaper offices, the wharves and street corners, were filled with people, and every scrap of intelligence was greedily devoured. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="3"> 
<head>Narration of facts.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> About <time value="6">six</time> and <time value="0.5oclock">a half o'clock</time>, or thereabouts, the <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">General Clinch</rs>, <persName n="Relyea,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:Relyea,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Relyea</surname></persName>, having discovered the approach of the <orgName n="Star of the West" type="newspaper">Star of the West</orgName>, signalled the fact to the occupants of the battery lately thrown up on the beach at <persName n="Morris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Morris,John,,,:1"><surname>Morris</surname></persName>' Islands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>This vessel, it is known, left her wharf sometime during the evening before, with a guard of <num value="80">eighty</num> men from the ranks of the <orgName n="Palmetto Guards" type="guards">Palmetto Guards</orgName> and the <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> Volunteers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The duty assigned them was to keep strict surveillance over the harbor, and to make such signals as had been agreed upon in the event of the approach of reinforcements to the fortress in possession of the <orgName n="U. S. Troops" type="org">United States troops</orgName>, as well as to report the approach of any vessel that may appear in the offing.--In the early grey of the morning the guard boat <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> described the steamer heading in from the sea, and with as much celerity as possible performed the remaining part of the task assigned her. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> As soon as signalled, the entire camp on <placeName key="tgn,2525074" n="1.000 2" reg="morris' island, charleston, south carolina">Morris' Island</placeName> was astir.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>There was no need for the reveille beat to quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The men were already at their posts before the orders were given.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>For some minutes they remained in anxious suspense, ready for what every <num value="1">one</num> believed sure to come, and that &mdash; a volley from the heavy guns of <placeName key="tgn,2096786" n="1.000 14" reg="sumter, sumter, south carolina">Sumter</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> As soon as the <orgName n="Star of the West" type="newspaper">Star of the West</orgName> rounded the point, she took to what is termed &#x0022;<term type="ship">Ship</term> <rs type="ship">Channel</rs>,&#x0022; inside the bar, and proceeded straight forward, until nearly opposite the work on <placeName key="tgn,2525074" n="1.000 2" reg="morris' island, charleston, south carolina">Morris' Island</placeName>, not more than <num value="3">three</num>-quarters of a mile from the battery, and within excellent range of the guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>At this position of affairs the command was given to fire, and a ball was sent whizzing athwart the bows of the steamer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>This significant hint to proceed no further was noticed in no other manner by the vessel than by displaying a large flag of the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>As soon as the <orgName n="Stars and Stripes" type="newspaper">Stars and Stripes</orgName> were run up to the mast-head, the act of defiance was met with a succession of heavy shots from the fortification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The vessel continued on her way, with increased speed; but <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> shots taking effect, she concluded to advance no further, and this conclusion was hastened by the shots from <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Moultrie</placeName>, which, though harmless and out of range of the steamer, still gave evidence that hotter work was on hand if further attempt was made to proceed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> The &#x0022;Star of the <rs>West</rs>&#x0022; was clearly made out as the name of the vessel, so that there was no mistake on this point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>She was possessed of no armament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>As soon as <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> shots had been fired upon her from <placeName key="tgn,2525074" n="1.000 2" reg="morris' island, charleston, south carolina">Morris' Island</placeName>, and as many more from <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Moultrie</placeName>, it was evident that she would lower her colors to half-mast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>She veered about so as to avoid any further messengers of this kind from the fortifications, which, with <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> more discharges, finally ceased. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="4"> 
<head>The damage done</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The steamer was very trifling, only <num value="2">two</num> of about <num value="17">seventeen</num> shots &mdash; all that was fired &mdash; took effect upon her. <num value="1">One</num> struck the vessel about the forward part of the bow, the other amidships, in the vicinity of the wheel-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>No idea of the extent of damage done could be ascertained, indeed it could not have been known whether she had been struck at all had it not been for the heavy, dull sound, and subsequent crash, always accompanying the ball that &#x0022;makes its mark&#x0022; in a naval engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>At all events she could not have been badly injured or disabled, for even while the firing continued she rounded to and started off seaward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>As soon as this intention was shown, all firing was instantly suspended. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="5">

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> While the engagement lasted, no demonstration whatever was made by the command in possession of the frowning fortress &mdash; <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName> &mdash; except the opening of the port-holes and running out of the guns which bear upon <placeName key="tgn,2525074" n="1.000 2" reg="morris' island, charleston, south carolina">Morris' Island</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Moultrie</placeName>.

<div4 type="entry" n="6"> 
<head>The feeling at <placeName reg="Castle Pinckney">Castle Pinckney</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> At <placeName reg="Castle Pinckney">Castle Pinckney</placeName>, under command of <persName n="Pettigrew,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Pettigrew,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Pettigrew</surname></persName>, the ardor of the men knew no bounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The greatest eagerness was shown by all to have a shot at the stranger, with the intention of bringing out the fire of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The guns of the <rs type="place">Castle</rs> were all manned simply upon the spontaneous movement of the men themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Each sprang to his post, without command of the officer in change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>It was with the greatest difficulty than he could restrain them from firing; and it was not until a peremptory order to that effect was given that they held themselves aloof from the batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The eagerness at <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Forts Moultrie</placeName> and <placeName reg="Three Trees, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096824">Johnson</placeName> was equally great &mdash; though the garrison at the former were gratified in the privilege of a number of harmless shots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Better luck to them next time. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="7"> 
<head>Who fired the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shot?</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> Since the event of the crisis, much curiosity has been excited to learn the man who fired the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>After diligent inquiry, we believe it is settled that the honor belongs to the <rs>Washington</rs> <orgName type="mil" key="Light">Light Infantry</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Though this corps is not stationed in the entrenchments on <placeName key="tgn,2525074" n="1.000 2" reg="morris' island, charleston, south carolina">Morris' Island</placeName>, from which the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> gun was fired, still, a single representative of the corps, we are informed, was at <num value="1">one</num> of the guns, and to him betel the duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>We believe the name of the gentleman is <persName n="Branch,Lieutenant,J.,L.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="default:Branch,J.,L.,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut.</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>L.</foreName> <surname>Branch</surname></persName>. </p> </div4>

<head>The city.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/> After all the facts of the affair in the harbor had become generally known throughout the city, the excitement in nowise abated.--Several companies of troops, never before in actual service, were called out and sent to different localities, where their presence might be needed, and every precaution was taken by the energetic administration to secure all points that might be useful. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> In the streets, military uniforms were numerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Old and young assumed the &#x0022;cloth of war,&#x0022; and took their places in the ranks.--War, actual war, seemed inevitable; but with the <num value="1001">thousand and one</num> rumors that flew about, nothing could be set down as certain. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="9"> 
<head>The flag of Truce.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> Towards <time value="11oclock">eleven o'clock</time>, a boat from <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, bearing an officer in full uniform, with a white flag, was seen to approach the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>The officer was met at the wharf by <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> gentlemen, and was suffered in quietness to land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>He gave his name as <rs type="role">Lieut.</rs> <placeName reg="," key="possibilities=20">Hall, U. S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Official information has been communicated to the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> that the political connection heretofore existing between the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">State of South Carolina</placeName> and the <name>States</name> which were known as the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> had ceased; and that the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">State of South Carolina</placeName> had resumed all the powers it had delegated to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> under the compact known as the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Either or both of these events occurring during the period in which the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">State of South Carolina</placeName> constituted a part of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, was then distinctly notified to the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> as an act or acts of hostility, because either or both would be regarded, and could only be intended to dispute the right of the <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">State of South Carolina</placeName> to that political independence which she has always asserted and will always retain. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>To repel such an attempt, is too plainly a duty to allow it to be discussed; and while defending its waters, the authorities of the <rs>State</rs> have been careful to conduct the affairs of the <rs>State</rs> so that no act, however necessary for its defence, should lead to a us less waste of life.
