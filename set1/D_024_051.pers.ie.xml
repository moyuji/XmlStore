<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>It was then that the noble <rs>Chatham</rs> thus spoke: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> &#x0022;Sorry I am to hear the liberty of speech in this <persName n="House,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:House,nomatch:0"><surname>House</surname></persName> imputed as a crime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>But the imputation shall not discourage me. It in a liberty I mean to exercise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>No gentleman ought to be afraid to exercise it. It is a liberty by which the gentleman who calumniates it might have profited.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> It has been frequently said upon this floor since the commencement of this unnatural war, that we are making history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Sir, we are but repeating it. Repeating its follies, its madness, its wickedness, instead of avoiding them, being instructed by its examples.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>They would admonish us by these examples, and who would have us profit by them are, by the advocates of power and the tools of faction, charged, like <placeName reg="Chatham, Ontario, Canada" key="tgn,7016856">Chatham</placeName>, with being seditions, disloyal, and as being sympathizers with rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Well, sir, this is not strange.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Great popular commotions, great civil revolutions, always bring to the surface of society a class of <unclear></unclear> wide in their own conceits, but really too ignorant and too debased to be instructed by the lessons of history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Thrown by revolutionary force into unnatural positions, and true to their native instructs, they crawl around the feet of a temporary power, and seek their own greatness in the detraction of those who would have wisdom in counsel and moderation in action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Such men glory in nothing so much as in writing the name of <persName n="Aristides,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Aristides,nomatch:0"><surname>Aristides</surname></persName> on the shell. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> In his annual Message, transmitted to Congress on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day of the session, the <rs>President</rs> thus speaks: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> &#x0022;We, of this Congress and this Administration, will be remembered in spite of ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>No personal significance or insignificance can spare <num value="1">one</num> or another of us. The fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> A moment's lunacy after <measure n="18months" type="date">eighteen months</measure> of madness!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>A flash of reason at the conclusion of an hour's incoherent raving!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>What will the future think of me?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>How shall I and my administration live in history?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>If such questions had constantly presented themselves to the <rs>Executive</rs>, and had he honestly and uniformly acted in reference to the judgment of impartial history, how different would have been his and our situation now. But, sir, party, not country; vengeance, not justice, have been the objects most dear to this Administration; and the evidence of this fact, which they have and will continue to furnish, will light them down in &#x0022;dishonor to the latest generation.&#x0022; I know this language may be considered harsh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The question may be asked, as it has often been asked heretofore, why denounce the rebels?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>I answer, sir, that the rebels, as they are called, are not to be affected by denunciation or praise, from you or me. They have gone out from among us, and are not to be brought back by denunciation, but by wisdom in council even more than by bravery in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>That there may be wisdom in council, both for the purpose of reuniting a dissevered country and for the still greater and nobler purpose of preserving civil constitutional liberty, I have a right to speak my honest convictions in reference to the executive action and of party action; and, having the right, I shall be governed in its exercise by no other consideration than that of the public good. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> At the commencement of the new year, it may be well to review the political chart by which our action has been governed, that thereby we may in future avoid the errors of the past. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> &#x0022;We, of this Congress and this Administration, (says the <rs>President</rs>,) will be remembered in spite of ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>No personal significance or insignificance can spare <num value="1">one</num> or another of us.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> Since, then, sir, we are each to be &#x0022;lighted down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation.&#x0022; it is but right that each make his own appeal to the awful tribunal of history, and vindicate his action in this national catastrophe, even before &#x0022;the latest generation.&#x0022; But where is the necessity of making <num value="1">one</num>'s own defence, of condemning the action of others ? Why find fault with that which you cannot control and for which you are not responsible?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>My answer is plain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Some of us here can only act upon measures of public policy submitted to us by others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>No efforts of ours to give a proper direction to public affairs by propositions of legislation or tender of advice can avail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>An Administration policy, supported by a majority of this Congress, is submitted for our approval or rejection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>If we approve, well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>If we reject, then, as the dogma sought to be enforced is that the <name>Administration</name> is the <rs>Government</rs> and the <rs>Government</rs> is the <name>Administration</name>, we are to be charged with being opposed to the <rs>Government</rs> and in favor of rebellion.--The questions, then, upon which history is to decide are simply these: Is this Administration right or wrong ? Are its measures, as means for the restoration of the <rs>Union</rs> and the preservation of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, wise or unwise, proper or improper; and should they or should they not receive the support of the representatives of the <name>States</name> and of the people ? </p> 
<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head>A review of the past.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> Rightly to determine these questions we must review, to some extent, the past, and consider the situation of the present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>We are, and for <measure n="18months" type="date">eighteen months</measure> have been, in the midst of the greatest political revolution the world has ever seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>We delude ourselves when we say &mdash; and we cannot deceive the judgment of history by the declaration &mdash; that such a revolution has <hi rend="italics">no cause.</hi> I appeal to the history of the past for the truth of this assertion: That there never has been any great moral, social, or political revolution, without some cause more or less great, more or less justifiable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>All Governments consider revolutions against their authority as without cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Were their judgments of the rightfulness or wrongfulness of the exercise of power by themselves and of resistance thereto by others admitted as the infallible rule, liberty could not exist, but despotism would everywhere prevail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>According to such a standard of judgment, the great <name>English</name> revolution was a stupendous crime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>No <rs n="Bourbon" type="royalfamily">Bourbon</rs> could see aught but criminality in the <rs>French</rs> revolution, and the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> struggle for independence was regarded by the <rs>English King</rs> and Ministry, and even by the <rs>English</rs> people, with as great abhorrence as a wicked resistance to rightful authority as we affect to regard the resistance of the revolted States to Federal authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The law of revolutions, or that by which their character in most generally determined, is that &#x0022;might makes right;&#x0022; that success is justification. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> The impartial student of history, however, will be forced to the conclusion that there have been revolutions which have failed that ought to have succeeded, and that there have been successful revolutions which ought to have failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>My own opinion, sir, is that this revolution ought to fail unless you make that rightful in the conclusion which was wrongful in the beginning &mdash; not because it was wholly without cause, but because its causes did not amount to a justification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>No portion of the people have a right, for light or trivial causes, or from apprehended evil, and without <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> exhausting all reasonable and proper means to avert it, to plunge the whole country into civil war. But, sir, while I honestly believe the causes of the present revolution were not sufficient to amount to a justification of it, and while, therefore, I believe it ought not to succeed, I am equally honest in my conviction that it will succeed for all practical purposes &mdash; during this Administration, at least &mdash; unless this Administration and this Congress shall change their policy, and be governed by wiser counsel in the future than they have been in the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>This may be considered plain talk in the <orgName n="American Senate" type="senate">American Senate</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Some may even effect to treat it as the honest warning of <placeName reg="Chatham, Ontario, Canada" key="tgn,7016856">Chatham</placeName> to the <orgName n="English Parliament" type="parliament">English Parliament</orgName> was treated &mdash; as disloyal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Had the <orgName n="English Parliament" type="parliament">English Parliament</orgName> listened to and acted upon his advice, the colonies had been saved to the crown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Had the <name>Administration</name> listened </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> to and acted upon the advice of those whom they, in their superciliousness and haughtiness of power, have presumed to distrust, instead of war and carnage, peace and harmony would everywhere throughout the land have this day prevailed. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="2"> 
<head>The cause of the rebellion.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>The causes of revolutions do not generally lie on the surface of things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>They are not usually what they seem to be. They are not so often Isolated acts of oppression on the part of Government, as the assertion of the right as a principle on the part of Government to do them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>It was not simply the imposition of a trifling tax upon tea that caused the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> revolution, but it was the assertion of Parliament to tax the colonies without their consent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>It was a controversy between the <name>Crown</name> and his Ministers on the <num value="1">one</num> side and the people of the colonies on the other, in reference to the powers of Government, under the <rs>English Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The imposition of the tax and the attempt to collect it were only the occasion of testing the right claimed by force of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>The student of history will find no difficulty in tracing the causes of our present revolution to a radical and fundamental difference of opinion among our people in reference to the true theory of our Government, and the limitations upon Federal or State authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Is this a Government of the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> as a <hi rend="italics">quasi</hi> political body, acting rightfully by force of a popular numerical majority, the voice of which majority constitutionally decides the character of legislation; or is it a Government of the people of the <rs>State</rs>, representative in <unclear></unclear> character, and limited in its powers, legislative as well as executive and judicial, by the delegation of authority expressed in the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs> ? The note delivery of fugitives from service and labor, the raid of <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName> into <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, the election of <persName><foreName>Abraham</foreName></persName>-<persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> as <rs type="role2">President</rs>, none of these were the cause, in my opinion, of this revolution; but it was the assertion of the power and duty of Congress, and of the people of the free States, to abolish slavery, or so circumscribe and limit it that &#x0022;the public mind could rest in the conviction of its ultimate extinction.&#x0022; It was the assertion of the right to abolish, accompanied by such acts as evidenced the purpose to abolish, that led to this revolution. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="3"> 
<head><persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s indifference to it.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/> It must have been apparent to the <rs>President</rs>, as it certainly was to everybody else, after his election, that unless some means of pacification were adopted, that an attempt at national disruption was inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Such an attempt he may have regarded as unreasonable, as criminal; but neither its unreasonableness nor criminality could excuse the jocular in difference with which he seemed to regard it. He had been victorious in the political race for power, and could have afforded even to have been generous towards those laboring under apprehensions of evil to themselves from his Administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>But, sir, when he saw that the whole country was agitated and filled with alarm, and that the work of disruption had in fact commenced, it was criminal indifference on his part to give assurance to his country men that the constitutional rights of the people of the several States should be maintained, and the <rs>Union</rs> preserved unimpaired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Where, then, was his love for the <rs>Union</rs> ? When those who were patriotically struggling by day and night for the adoption of some peaceful and honorable mode of adjustment were needing words of encouragement, and were anxiously seeking assistance from those about to be installed into power, did he whisper aught of hope in their ear ?--When, in disguise, he sought the capital of the <rs>Republic</rs>, and found good and wise men, representatives of the <name>States</name> that had not seceded, endeavoring to devise some means to arrest the work of national dismemberment, did he aid them by his counsel or encourage them by his promise?

<head>Conclusion.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/> <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, in animadverting it may be, with apparent severity, upon the action of the <rs>President</rs>, and the means which he has unwisely, professedly adopted to restore the <rs>Union</rs>, I have been governed by no feeling of personal unkindness to him. He, I, all of us, sink into utter littleness amid the awful throes of a nation's dissolution, and in view of all the consequences to result from it; the giving up of all that is glorious in the past; the destruction of all that was valuable in the present; the resigning of all that was bright in the future; the confession that we have not been able to preserve the rich in heritage bequeathed us by a heroic, noble, and patriotic ancestry, and the transmission to our children of naught but the record of our political follies and crimes, affords occasion only for the deepest self-abasement. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/> <rs type="role2">Senators</rs>, can anything, even now, be done to restore our once <orgName n="Glorious Union" type="union">glorious Union</orgName>, and to preserve our once batted nationality?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>If so, we should be stimulated to make the effort by the recollection of all our fathers did for us; by all the blessings we shall lose; by all the ills our children and children's children, for all generations, may be forced to suffer; and that we may escape, not only the scorn and derision of the present, but that our memories may not be cursed by the indignation of the wise and good for all time to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>If my feeble voice could now become potential, I would say, let hostilities immediately cease throughout the whole land: let an armistice, by mutual consent of contending parties, be immediately proclaimed; let both sections, honorably, and as brave men, acknowledge their faults, and, as far as possible, retract their errors. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/> Let the people of every State, <name>North</name>, <name>South</name>, <name>East</name>, and <name>West</name>, through their delegates, meet in a <orgName n="National Convention" type="convention">national convention</orgName>, and there, imitating the example of their fathers, agree upon a common basis of Union for all time to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>Then, indeed, would a happy and multitudinous people raise again, amid the shouts of joy, that same old national flag, with every star reset, and with no strips creased; and, chastened by affliction, and made wiser by experience &mdash; rekindling the watch fires of constitutional liberty upon every mountain top, never again to be extinguished &mdash; renew their march in the path way to a common destiny of national glory, greatness, and renown. </p> </div4> </div3> </div2> </div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/> The <hi rend="italics">Enquirer</hi> of yesterday and the day proceeding contained a very able paper from <persName n="Marshall,Mister,A.,J.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00037" reg="default:Marshall,A.,J.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>Marshall</surname></persName> of <placeName key="tgn,1002368" n="1.000 18" reg="fauquier, virginia, united states">Fauquier</placeName>, a member of the <orgName n="State Senate" type="senate">State Senate</orgName> recommending the adoption of the <orgName n="Sinking Fund" type="fund">sinking fund</orgName> system by the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> as an efficient means of strengthening its credit and accomplishing the ultimate liquidation of the public debt at the earliest possible period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/><persName n="Marshall,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00038" reg="nearbymention:Marshall,A.,J.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Marshall</surname></persName> who is a well-informed gentleman, argues the subject with clearness and force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>The system he proposes, if property inaugurated, would no doubt achieve for the <rs>Government</rs> all he claims for it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/> It is absolutely indispensable that some measure should be adopted that will strengthen the credit of the <rs>Government</rs> and at least impede the rapid increase of Government paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>The amount now afloat is so much in excess of the wan's of commerce that it has sustained a heavy depreciation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>As great as it must be, as a matter of course from this excess, it is still further increased by speculators and extortioners, who find the currency a ready scape goat upon which to lay their enormous crimes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/> As if these causes of the depreciation of the public credit were not sufficient, the <orgName n="Confederate Senate" type="org">Confederate Senate</orgName> <orgName n="Finance Committee" type="committee">Finance Committee</orgName> have gravely proposed a repudiation of the <num value="0.08">eight per cent</num>, pledge upon all notes not presented by a certain day, and to repudiate, temporarily at least, all notes of a certain Issue not brought in by another date; these latter notes declaring on their face that they are receivable in all dues to the <rs>Government</rs>, and the committee proposing that they shall be rejected by the <rs>Government</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/> The financial expedients of the <orgName n="Treasury Department" type="department">Treasury Department</orgName> have proved abortive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>The payment of interest in <hi rend="italics">gold</hi>--the promise of <hi rend="italics"><num value="0.08">eight per cent</num> </hi> on the notes have had no more effect than the finances of the man in the moon upon the credit of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>If those expedients have had any effect at all it has been adverse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>Either might prejudice the standing of the financial management of the <name>Department</name>, as well as the credit of the <rs>Government</rs> which was supposed to stand in need of the bolstering of such superficial measures. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/> Let Congress turn away from the ridiculous propositions to coerce a conversion of notes into bonds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>They must fall in every respect except to injure most seriously the public credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>Let them pass a liberal tax bill, and immediately afterwards adopt measures looking to the retiring of the notes without compulsion and the ultimate redemption of the issues of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>The <orgName n="Sinking Fund" type="fund">sinking fund</orgName> would be an invaluable auxiliary if properly applied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>To this might be added a plan for substituting State credit for a part of the floating Confederate currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>This would retire a great deal, and increase largely the public confidence since it would be a guarantee against repudiation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>To these again might be further added a plan for the sale of the <rs>Confederate</rs> bonds; for these measures would so increase the standing of those bonds that they could be sold, if not at par, at a price so near it that it would be a great saving to the <rs>Government</rs> to sell them instead of issuing notes and buying stores and arms at the increased price of a further degeneration of the currency. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/> The <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> has greater resources than any Government in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>The war in a great degree prevents them from being available now. But if the public finances can be so managed as to check the dreadful depreciation of the paper currency now going on, the public credit will immediately after the war be equal to that of any country in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>The grand staples of the country have partially been employed by the <rs>Government</rs> in its foreign operations, and could some plan be matured for using them to a greater extent much assistance would be given to other measures for enhancing the value of the <rs>Government</rs> paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>Governments are generally unfortunate speculators, and speculation is outside of the general duties and powers of Administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>Yet circumstanced as the country is, there is every excuse that a Government could have for adventuring upon a trade which must bring certain results. </p> </div3>
