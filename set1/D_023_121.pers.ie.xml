<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The war is looked upon as the subject of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> importance by the <rs>Governor</rs>, and especial reference is made to the present defenseless condition of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> North Carolina</placeName>, and that portion of the <rs>State</rs> along the seaboard.--To aid in the defence of this portion of the <rs>State</rs> now threatened by, and partially in possession of, the enemy, it is recommended that a State reserve of at least <num value="10">ten</num> regiments be raised, to be accepted for <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure>, and discharged in time to plant their crops in the spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>This force, axillary to the <rs>Confederate</rs> troops, it is thought would be able to prevent an advance of the enemy into the interieur, and whilst subsisting upon the abundant supplies of the <rs>Eastern</rs> counties, could benefit the whole State by aiding in withdrawing vast quantities of provisions from exposed points. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> Next in importance to the defence of the <rs>State</rs> against the public enemy, the <rs>Governor</rs> regards the defence of the people against extortion and starvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>He criticizes severely the speculation and extortion which the war has developed, and alludes to the sufferings it must produce among the poorer classes of the <rs>State</rs>, unless arrested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>He recommends that the <name>Legislature</name> take immediate steps to prevent the exportation from the <rs>State</rs> of salt, leather, shoes, woolen cloth, cotton cloth, yarn, pork, and bacon, flour and potatoes &mdash; except for the army and by regular agents of the <rs>Government</rs>, and except when purchased by any county and corporate authorities of sister states, under such regulation as will amount to satisfactory proof that such articles are for private use, or charitable distribution to the poor of such counties, towns, &#x0026;c., and not for speculation &mdash; not, however, in violation of any existing contracts made with citizens of other States. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> As a means of relief for, and to provide against the possible suffering of the wives and children of soldiers, the purchase and storing, at some safe point in the interior, of at least <num value="200000">two hundred thousand</num> bushels of corn and <measure n="500000l." type="pounds"><num value="500000">five hundred thousand</num> pounds</measure> of pork, to be sold to them at rates sufficient to cover the cost, transportation, &#x0026;c., is earnestly recommended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>These supplies, it is stated can now be purchased in the eastern counties at moderate prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Anticipating the necessity of such a measure, the <rs>Governor</rs> announces that he has already ordered the building of large crib on the <orgName n="North Carolina Railroad" type="railroad">North Carolina Railroad</orgName>, and made other preliminary arrangements for purchasing on a large scale. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> The prospect of obtaining cotton cloths at reasonable rates is represented to be better than it has been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The stockholders of the largest and most enterprising manufacturing company in the <rs>State</rs> have agreed to sell all their productions at <num value="0.75">75 percent</num> upon cost, which will reduce the price about <num value="0.5">one half</num>, and some <num value="7">seven</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> other companies have intimated an intention of following their example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The woolen manufacturers are more incorrigible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Some of them when asked to furnish their goods at <num value="0.75">75 per cent</num>, declined entirely, and other agree to do so by fixing enormous profits on the cost of the raw material, and then adding the <num value="0.75">75 per cent</num>, on the finished article, making their profits greater than before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>These are recommended to the tender mercies of the <name>Legislature</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> In relation to ordnance stores, the <rs>Governor</rs> states that, under an act of the <name>Legislature</name>, a contract has been made with a firm, and that they have erected powder mills, and are now nearly ready to begin operations on a scale sufficient to make about <measure n="4000l." type="pounds"><num value="4000">4,000</num> pounds</measure> per week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> will furnish the mills with about <measure n="3000l." type="pounds"><num value="3000">3,000</num> pounds</measure> of nitre per week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The department has contracted with manufacturers in the <rs>State</rs> for <num value="300">300</num> now rifles per month, and it is hoped the department will soon be able to keep on hand a supply for <num value="5000">five thousand</num> men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> The finances of the <rs>State</rs> next claim the <rs>Governor</rs>'s consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The debt of the <rs>State</rs> is put down in round numbers at <measure n="20983351.01dollars" type="currency">$20,983,351.01</measure>, and the receipts from taxes for the year <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct> were <measure n="715762.39dollars" type="currency">$715,762.39</measure>. In order to meet the interest on the public debt, and to make up the sum due from counties where the tax could not be collected on account of the presence of the enemy, an increase <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> of at least <num value="0.25">25 per cent</num> on the present amount of taxation is recommended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The Governor also recommends that a tax of <num value="0.25">25 per cent</num> be laid upon the nett profits of all persons who have, during the present year, speculated in the necessaries of life, such as corn, flour, bacon, pork, shoes, leather, cotton cloth, yarn, and <rs n="woolen goods" type="product">woolen goods</rs>, to be continued during the next year or longer, if necessary, the proceeds to be applied to the support of the wives and children or widows of soldiers whose property, as listed on the tax books, shall be below a certain sum. He is clearly of the opinion that no more Treasury notes should be issued, if it be possible to avoid it. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>As an illustration of this, he said to our Minister that, at the time of the war between the <rs>Allied Powers</rs> and <rs>Russia</rs>, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> had ostensibly carried contraband goods in <placeName key="tgn,2634462" n="1.000 2" reg="russian river, kenai peninsula, alaska">Russian</placeName> ports, and constructed ships for the <rs>Czar Nicholas</rs>, and that not with standing the protest of <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>He preferred to think that they did all they could to oppose them, but the fact that they could not succeed ought to prove to the <rs>Minister</rs> of the <rs>U.
