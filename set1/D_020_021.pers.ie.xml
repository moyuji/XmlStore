<head>The order of battle.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/> When large bodies of men approach for battle, only a proportional part of them are engaged at a time &mdash; they are replaced by another similar force &mdash; the progress of the battle is by successive engagements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>On the genius and judgment of the chief will depend the character of the action, whether it shall be defensive or offensive. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/> When an army awaits the attack, it takes its position and forms its line of battle according to the nature of the ground, and the character and strength of the enemy's force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>If offensive, the main thing is to seize upon the decisive point of the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>This point is determined by the configuration of the ground, and the position of the contending forces, or by a combination of these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>The defence is considered the stronger form of actions of war, and a skillful General will take advantage of favorable circumstances to change the defensive into the offensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>Military writers lay down <num value="12">twelve</num> orders of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>A description of these would be too long and too complicated to interest the reader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>Which of these should be followed, must be decided by the chief himself on the ground, where all the circumstances may be duty considered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>To concentrate a superiority of forces at the decisive point is the principal purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>This point is in the flanks or in the rear of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>To do this the skill of the <rs>General</rs> is brought into requisition. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/> On the field of battle, the <rs>Infantry</rs> is divided into <num value="3">three</num> bodies &mdash; in advanced guard, a main body, and a reserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>These <num value="3">three</num> bodies are separated from each other by intervals, which will depend upon the nature of the ground &mdash; the advanced guard occupying the front, the main body at a distance from <num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num> to <num value="300">three hundred</num> paces in its rear, and the reserve at a like interval in the rear of the main body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>The troops composing these <num value="3">three</num> bodies will be formed either in columns of battalions, or be deployed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>For an attack, for evolutions, or for defence against cavalry, the formation of columns of battalions is the best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>To repel the enemy's attack by a fire, and to present a less favorable mark to the enemy's Artillery, the battalion should be deployed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>The reserve should be composed of the most reliable troops, and should, if possible, be kept masked from the enemy's view and fire, until called into action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>The time for engaging the reserve is either when the enemy has been shaken in its attack by the resistance offered by the main body, or when the main body is unable further to resist the enemy's efforts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/> The cavalry is usually placed in the rear of the infantry, and should be masked from the fire until the moment arrives to bring it into action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>The habitual formation of cavalry for the attack is a line of <num value="2">two</num> ranks, with a reserve or support in rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>Cavalry should wait patiently until a way is prepared for its action by the fire of artillery on the enemy's infantry; or when the infantry is fatigued or exhausted; or when the infantry is in motion, so as to surprise it before it can form to receive the attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>It should direct its charge on that part of the enemy's infantry, where it will be itself exposed to the least column of fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>If the infantry is in a line, its charge should be made on <num value="1">one</num> of its flanks; if in square, on <num value="1">one</num> of the angles of the square. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/> The manner of placing the artillery, and its employment, must be regulated by relative importance under given circumstances with respect to the action of the other arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>In defence, the principal part is usually assigned to the artillery; in offensive movements the reverse generally obtains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>In defence the batteries should be distributed along the entire front of the position occupied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>The distance between the batteries should not be much over <num value="600">600</num> paces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>When the wings of a position are weak, heavy batteries should be placed to secure them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>A sufficient number of pieces should always be held in reserve for a moment of need.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>In the attack the heaviest pieces should be placed on the flanks of the ground occupied by the assailant, or on the centre if more favorable to the end to be obtained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>In all the movements of the batteries great care should be taken not to place them so that they shall in the least impede the operations of the other troops. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>We did not weigh it, but our readers can guess its size when we say it was as large as our <num value="2">two</num> fists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>This potato was raised from seed planted last <dateStruct value="-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct> was a year ago, and as it is likely that no foreign potatoes will be imported in time for next spring's planting, we have thought it would be an advantage to our readers to explain how the gentleman (a planter) who presented us the potato managed to save seed for the planting of last spring's crop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>He informs us that about the <dateStruct value="-08-1"><day reg="1">first</day> of <month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct> of last year he ploughed up the ground where the spring crop had been planted and gathered, but enough seed had been left to produce a fall crop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>His reason for taking them up was that if they remained they would sprout prematurely and be killed by cold weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>At the usual time he planted the seed thus gathered, and raised as good a crop and as large potatoes as any of his neighbors raised. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/> This process is worth trying, and we have thought it our duty to describe it to our readers.

<head>Recognition.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/> The battle of the <num value="21" type="ordinal">21st</num> has decided the question of recognition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>The complete overthrow of the flower of the <rs>Northern</rs> army; the capture of a number of guns unprecedented in the history of warfare, with immense army stores and munitions; the utter rout and dismay of the enemy; the threatening of the <rs>Northern Capital</rs>; the panic of its inhabitants and of the <rs>Government</rs>, to be soon followed by their flight from the city, are facts which must extort from the rulers of the earth a recognition of our power and capacity for national self-existence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/> The enemy's Congress had confessed that the <rs>Southern</rs> movements vastly exceeded the proportions of a rebellion, by granting half a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men and <num value="500000000">five hundred millions</num> of dollars for the war of subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/><num value="11">Eleven</num> sovereign States were in league in the movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>All the insignia and organism of a distinct and independent national existence were visible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>Of every attribute and function of nationality the <rs>Confederacy</rs> were in possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>There was but <num value="1">one</num> thing wanting to recognition, and that was a demonstration that we were able in fact to make good our resistance to the <rs>North</rs> in its effort to compel us back into the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>Nations may be ever so well disposed towards a struggling nationality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>They may desire to recognize its existence as distinct and independent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>They may be anxious to establish relations of friendship and intercourse with it; but they would commit themselves awkwardly, if they recognized a Government that soon ceased to exist and was speedily obliterated by the superior power of its adversary. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/> There was but <num value="1">one</num> thing wanting to the <rs>Confederacy</rs> of the <rs>South</rs> in this respect, and that was the proof of its capacity to cope with its adversary in physical power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>We have demonstrated that fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>It is no longer doubtful whether we can maintain our ground against the foe. The doubt has transposed itself to the other side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>The question will soon come to be, whether the <rs>North</rs> can stand up against the <rs>South</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>Ere long, if they do not grant peace we shall transfer the seat of war to Northern soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>We shall soon have an army in the field large enough to command the city of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>; and shall dictate from there the terms on which we shall treat with the <rs>North</rs>.--Foreign nations will consider us as already virtually in that position on learning the tidings from <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>Recognition is no longer doubtful. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/> The advantages that will accrue to our Government from recognition, will be many and decided; especially if it be a recognition extorted by our prowess, rather than bought by our cotton or by commercial largess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>We shall rank from the beginning on an equal footing with the proudest nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>We shall have the power to make treaties, and we shall speak a voice among the nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>We shall have envoys abroad, asserting our rights and representing our honor and our interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>We shall receive envoys at home, and conduct with them all the relations of international business, courtesy and diplomacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/><orgName n="Our Flag" type="newspaper">Our flag</orgName> will have a legal significance, and be on all seas and among all tongues an emblem of independence and power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>Our seamen, sailing in ships, will be recognized as something more than pirates or outlaws; and our people, wherever they go, will travel under the protection of a nationality, everywhere recognized and respected. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/> The advantages which we shall secure by recognition will be doubly enhanced if it be extorted by our valor and prowess, rather than bought by concession, bargain and solicitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>That nation is never really independent whose independence is not carved out by its own sword and good right arm. If we can whip a power bringing half a <num value="1000000">million</num> of soldiers against us, we can afford to use the sternest language to all powers in whatever appertains to our dignity and self-respect. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/> We consider our recognition virtually secured by the events of the last week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>Nothing more is needed but the form of recognition, and that soon follows the substance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>The recognition will not be owing to fawning nor to solicitation, nor to bargain, nor to cotton nor diplomacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>It will come as a tribute to our physical power, to our moral heroism and to our force of character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>At the same time that the nations will court our trade and strive to extend their commercial relations with our people, will they respect our power and pay homage to our moral firmness and elevation.--With recognition will also come the practical benefit of the virtual repudiation of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00197" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s</hi> blockade and the speedy opening of our ports to all the ships of the world. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>The telegraph, doubtless, has kept you advised of leading facts up to the present writing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>Rumors of all kinds are prevalent here, as elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>It is quite difficult, therefore, to reach the truth, either absolute or in detail. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/> I have conversed with a number of officers and others who were either actively engaged in or spectators to the conflict at <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull's Run</placeName>, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>Gentlemen from this city, who rode out yesterday to the scene of action, and left there in the afternoon, have likewise given me accounts of what they saw. An officer of the <orgName type="regiment" key="MA6">Massachusetts Sixth Regiment</orgName>, who was with the <rs>Federal</rs> pickets all of <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, says they were often within easy musket shot of the <rs>Confederate</rs> scouts; could see them distinctly, and at no great distance beyond their grand army rose into view.--Immense bodies of troops, with their glittering arms, were plainly discernable, including cavalry, artillery, infantry, &#x0026;c. The general hum and noise of an immense army preparing for battle impressed itself upon the ear.--The shrill railroad whistle sounded at short intervals, indicative of the arrival and departure of trains, probably bringing reinforcements, and returning for more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>My informant asserts constant firing of the enemy's pickets was heard all night, and <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="7">seven</num> volleys similar to discharges of regiments also greeted his ears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>These evidently proceeded from the <rs>Confederates</rs>, and as no Federal forces had gone out to attack, the presumption was the <rs>Confederates</rs>, by some mistake, had fired into each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>This, however, was only conjecture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>From all that could be ascertained there was no doubt of the enemy being strongly entrenched and fortified, with a large army in readiness for action. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/> A letter from a prominent and reliable source &mdash; a party engaged in the action of <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull's Run</placeName>, dated the day following, has been shown me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>It was an accidental repulse rather than a defeat, calculated to beget greater caution in future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>There were only <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> regiments, amongst which was the <rs>Massachusetts</rs> <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> and the <orgName type="regiment" n="NY12">New York Twelfth</orgName>, recently enlisted (not <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 12"><persName n="Butterfield,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00484" reg="mostcommon:Butterfield,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Butterfield</surname></persName>'s Twelfth Regiment</orgName> of volunteers, as supposed by some,) in the fight.--They had but little opportunity of proving effective, being opened upon in surprise by a raking fire of the masked battery, and obliged to retire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>Some assert they run badly, unbecoming the true soldier, whilst others say they did not. The odds were unquestionably adverse to the <rs>Federal</rs> troops in this affair, owing solely to the enemy's superior position and his hidden battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>The lamentations of the wounded were painful, though a few not seriously injured, were eager to give battle again, and in high spirits. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>The destruction of property and outrages perpetrated by a few of the soldiers on route, are severely reprehended, and peremptory orders have been given to punish all such offences and offenders in future, even unto death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>The lightest penalty is ball and chain. </p>
