<head>Our principal <unclear></unclear></head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/> The currency, the production of supplies for the soldiers and people, and the increased efficiency of the army, are <num value="3">three</num> momentous <unclear></unclear> which demand the most energetic and yet the most thoughtful and intelligent <unclear></unclear> of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is the most difficult of solution, but the time for discussing it has passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, the production of supplies, is a question involving the efficiency of the army even more than an increased number of troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>We have already enough men on the muster rolls of the army, if they can be brought to their posts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>But we have not enough force engaged in the <unclear></unclear> the army and the people, and those must be fed, or the work of subjugation is accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>We can whip the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, but starvation is an enemy that the <num value="1000">thousands</num> people are unable to resist. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/> We have not yet reached this dire extremely, but the enormous prices of all the adversities of life and clothing are sorely taking the capacities of the people, and give us a <unclear></unclear> warning to develop all our energies and husband all our resources to provide for the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>Congress should look this danger steadfastly in the face, and be ware how it adopts a policy which will diminish in any degree the productive power of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>It should not permit itself to be driven from its propriety by occasional military disasters, even of so grave a character as that at <placeName reg="Chickamauga, Walker, Georgia" key="tgn,7013598">Chickamauga</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>If <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00121" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName>'s defeat was attributable, as we are inclined to believe, to a want of men, there is a ready mode of supplying that deficiency without extending the conscript age, and increasing the consumers and diminishing the producers of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>The muster rolls of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00122" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> call for <num value="104000">one hundred and four thousand</num> men; yet he fought his battles with only about <num value="40000">forty thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>The rest were detailed in various departments &mdash; quartermaster, commissary and hospital departments, ward-masters, nurses, stewards, and wagoners, besides a host of stragglers and deserters.--Bring back the stragglers and deserters to their duty; substitute disabled soldiers for all able-bodied men detailed in other departments, and put negroes in the place of wagoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>The same remarks apply to other <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName> which have been diminished in like proportion with that of <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00123" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName>, and from the same causes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>Let Congress devote itself to making the army as strong in numbers as upon the muster rolls, and beware how it drawn upon the producing population to increase the number of mouths to be fed, whilst by the same process it diminishes the means of feeding them, and adds to the army only infirm and incompetent men, who are rendering invaluable service where they are, but would only fill the hospitals if placed in the field. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/> The only effective military service that men outside the conscript age can render, is in home organizations against raids, which will enable them to guard against <num value="1">one</num> of the most injurious annoyances we suffer from the enemy, and this can be accomplished either by Confederate or State legislation.--Anything beyond this should not be thought of for a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>The army of producers is as essential to the achievement of our independence as the army of soldiers, and neither can be diminished with safety <unclear></unclear> cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>The <unclear></unclear> men of the world <unclear></unclear> generally found between the ages of <num value="18">18</num> and <num value="45">45</num>, and it is only exceptional cases that they are fit for military duty beyond this limit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>Let Congress act with prudence as well as with rigor, for there are tremendous interests at stake. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head>Stop the <name>Runaways</name>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/> What are our authorities thinking of in granting passports to people enabling them to leave the country, where they have been making fortunes, for the sole purpose of avoiding military duty?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>What is the use of Congress making laws to fill the army if those whom the laws are intended to embrace are permitted by our own authorities to go, as they are going, in schools every day?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>We hear of numbers who have done nothing during the war but make money, clearing out now. Shut down the passport gate at once, or Congress may as well adjourn, so far as filling the army is concerned. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="3"> 
<head>Intemperate officers.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/> The crime of intemperance in a military or naval officer ought to be punished by the severest penalties of military law. It is only <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> in enormity to mutiny or desertion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>The private who deserts, no matter though he be enticed from his duty by the innocent yearnings of his heart for home, is punished with death, and all men pronounce the sentence just.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>What does the officer deserve who, led astray not by a virtuous impulse, but by a low and degrading appetite, imperils for his sensual gratification the lives of <num value="1000">thousands</num>, deranges the plans of his superiors, and places at hazard the liberty of his country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>No punishment can be too great for such an offender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>The demoralizing effects of his example, even if no other evil effects followed his conduct, demand of themselves that he should be displaced from his position and put in the ranks, or be ignominiously dismissed from the army. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
