<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>This destination the <num value="290">290</num> duly reached, after a fine run of <measure n="8days" type="date">eight days</measure>, and came to an anchor in <address><street n="Tarissa Roads">Tarissa Roads</street></address>, nothing of any moment having occurred to break the usual monotony of a sea voyage. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/> Sometime before the departure of the <num value="290">290</num> from the <rs>Mersey</rs>, a large bark left the <rs>Thames</rs> (cleared for <placeName key="tgn,1123369" n="1.000 1" reg="demerara,guyana,south america">Demerara</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7004550" n="1.000 590" reg="west indies">West Indies</placeName>,) to meet the <num value="290">290</num> at Tarissa, and there transfer to the latter vessel the guns and stores destined for her, and which formed the cargo of the bark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Some reason required to be assigned to the <name>Portuguese</name> authorities for the <num value="290">290</num> having anchored in the bay, and accordingly the excuse furnished to them was that her engines had broken down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>This plea was accepted as a valid <num value="1">one</num>, and during the week that intervened between the arrival at Tarissa of the <num value="290">290</num> and the bark, the crew of the former vessel were engaged ostensibly in repairing her engines, but ready in preparing her to receive her guns, &#x0026;c. During this interval, large parties of the inhabitants of Tarissa made daily visits to the <num value="290">290</num>, their curiosity evidently excited by the warlike appearance of what laid claim to be an English merchant vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>Many pertinent questions were asked by the <name>Portuguese</name>, and were as ingeniously evaded or met by the officers of the <num value="290">290</num>.--Among other things, the <name>Portuguese</name> wanted to know why the vessel had so many ports, and were told that, as she was bound to a warm climate, they were necessary for ventilation; and when they asked why there was such a numerous crew, the reply was, that as she was going on a surveying expedition she required to be well manned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Many similar questions were put, and in like manner answered; but it was all in vain to attempt to undeceive the <name>Portuguese</name>, and they would persist in calling her a &#x0022;<term type="ship">frigate</term> <rs type="ship">Inglesi</rs>.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/> About the lapse of a week from the arrival of the <num value="290">290</num> the bark above mentioned sailed in and anchored, her <rs type="role2">Captain</rs> alleging as a reason to the <name>Portuguese</name> officials that his vessel had sprung a leak, which would require to be repaired ere she could resume her voyage; and on this understanding the <name>Portuguese</name> at once placed her in quarantine, (which in the <rs>Azores</rs> lasts <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>) On the day after the bark's arrival <persName n="Bullock,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00092" reg="mostcommon:Bullock,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Bullock</surname></persName>, of the <num value="290">290</num>, being anxious to get his guns on board, hauled alongside the bark, and erected a pair of large shears to effect the transfer of her cargo from the bark's hold to the <num value="290">290</num>'s deck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>This brought off the <name>Portuguese</name> in a fury that their rules should have been broken by the <num value="290">290</num> having dared to communicate with a vessel that had still <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> quarantine to run, and they angrily demanded to know the reason why their regulations had been infringed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>They were told that the bark was in a sinking condition, and the erection of the <unclear>shea</unclear> was accounted for by urging the necessity of an immediate temporary transfer of her cargo, that the leak might be reached and stopped, and <persName n="Bullock,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00093" reg="mostcommon:Bullock,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Bullock</surname></persName> finally succeeded in bearing down all opposition by feigning to get in a passion, saying he was doing no more for the bark than any <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishman</rs> would do for a countryman in distress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>The <rs>Portuguese</rs> left the vessel, and the transshipment proceeded without further hindrance from those on shore. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/> About the afternoon of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> day, and when the transfer was nearly complete, the <rs>British</rs> screw <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Bahama</rs> came in, having on board <persName n="Semmes,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00094" reg="mostcommon:Semmes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Semmes</surname></persName> and the other late <rs type="role" reg="Officer">officers</rs> of the <rs>Sumter</rs>, besides the remainder of the <num value="290">290</num>'s armament and an addition of <num value="20">twenty</num> odd men to her crew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>On the <rs>Bahama</rs>'s arrival and anchorage on a somewhat similar pretext to those given to her <num value="2">two</num> predecessors, the <name>Portuguese</name> fairly lost all patience, and peremptorily insisted on the instant departure of all <num value="3">three</num> vessels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>The <rs>Bahama</rs> at once communicated with the <num value="290">290</num>, and having hauled over to the latter vessel everything destined for her, got up steam and left, followed by the <num value="290">290</num>, towing the now empty bark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>All <num value="3">three</num> went, not to sea, as they had been ordered to do, but to <placeName reg="Angra Bay">Angra Bay</placeName>, (a bay in the same island, and only a few leagues distant from <address><street n="Tarissa Roads">Tarissa Roads</street></address>) Here they remained unmolested until <time value="12pm">noon</time> the following day, (a Sunday,) when, for the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time, all <num value="3">three</num> vessels were ordered out of the <name>Portuguese</name> waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>All the <num value="290">290</num>'s guns being now mounted, and the vessel otherwise ready for a cruise, the order was obeyed, and all took their departure, the bark, as before, in tow of the <num value="290">290</num>, which having conveyed her well out to sea, cast her off, and, with a favoring breeze, she steered for <placeName reg="Cardiff, Cardiff, Wales" key="tgn,7008742">Cardiff</placeName> to bring out a further supply of coal for the <num value="290">290</num>'s use. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>The next step was formally to engage the crew to serve and fight under the <rs>Confederate</rs> flag, which having been done, the men were addressed by their <rs type="role2">Captain</rs> in an eloquent and stirring speech, in the course of which he said there were only <num value="4">four</num> vessels in the <orgName n="U.
