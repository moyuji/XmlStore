<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> --When the <rs>French</rs> revolution was at the zenith of its fury; when <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs> had sunk into the earth as the <unclear></unclear> disappears at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> frost of <dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>; when the country was deluged with <hi rend="italics">assignats,</hi> worth about half a sons to the livre, (that is, about <num value="40">forty</num> to <num value="1">one</num>.) and commodities had gone up in proportion in the depreciation of the currency, the mob of <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName> attributed it all to the acts of extortioners, forestallers, and brokers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The last named class were supposed to have all the coin in the country, and to impair the value of the currency by the enormous prices which they charged for it; and, for their especial benefit, a law was passed prescribing the guillotine as the appropriate punishment for any man who should be convicted of having bought a paper franc for less than its nominal value in coin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>But the forestallers and extortioners were the principal objects of revolutionary vengeance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>They, it was, who, according to the popular notion, enhanced the prices of all kinds of necessaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Compelled to pay <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <num value="20">twenty</num> francs for the same quantity of bread or butchers' meat which they had been accustomed in days when specie circulated freely, to purchase for <num value="1">one</num>, they never adverted to and perhaps were incapable of understanding the cause of the rise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>They laid upon the baker and butcher &mdash; the greatest of all extortioners in their eyes &mdash; the whole blame of the depreciated currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>In this delusion they were openly encouraged by their orators in the <rs>Convention</rs>, and on <num value="1">one</num> occasion Marat went so far as to encourage the mob to break into the bakeries and confectioneries, and plunder them of all they contained. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> We are thankful that matters have never proceeded to that extremity in these <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, nor do we believe it possible that they ever should.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>But it is apparent that a delusion very similar to that which stimulated the mob of <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName> in those terrible days to so many deeds of horror is widely prevalent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The soberest, best informed, and most conscientious men among us are constantly in the habit of attributing to brokers, extortioners, and forestallers, a state of things which is the inevitable consequence of a depreciated currency, and instead of directing their indignation against those who have contributed most to the depreciation in question, expend it all upon a class whom it has generated, and who have no more to do with it than the serpent has with that peculiar state of the atmosphere which is sure to draw him from his hole. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> In times of profound peace, when all the banks are paying specie, and adverse state of the exchanges, indicating a redundancy of the currency, is sure to produce an efflux of coin, and if wise measures be not at once adopted to restore the equilibrium &mdash; if, instead of curtailing their discounts and cutting short their issues, the banks continue to promote the overtrading, always consequent upon such a state of things, by enlarging their issues and multiplying their discounts &mdash; a fatal collapse is the inevitable consequence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The banks suspend, and specie is banished from circulation, or can be purchased only at a heavy premium. --This, we say, is the case very frequently, as we all know to our sorrow, in times of profound peace, and is, indeed, <num value="1">one</num> of the inevitable consequences of a redundant currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>And yet, in the midst of a tremendous war, when the enemy are pressing us with enormous armies from every point of the compass &mdash; when specie payments have been suspended for <measure n="2.5years" type="date">two years and a half</measure>, and coin is so rarely seen that the smallest gold piece is looked upon as a curiosity &mdash; when the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> is writing letters of congratulation to a distinguished <rs type="role2">Senator</rs> upon the encouraging fact that the circulation is only <num value="3">three</num> times as large as the country can bear with convenience &mdash; we are told by many persons, who seem religiously to believe it, that the brokers occasioned the high price of gold which lately ruled by certain arts perfectly incomprehensible to us, but no doubt quite intelligible to those who make the accusation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>It is of no consequence in the world that the same officer issues many <num value="1000000">millions</num> of dollars worth of notes, and then attempts to discredit them, thereby necessarily causing a suspicion of all Treasury issues &mdash; this can have no effect whatever in degrading the currency, or, to use the current phrase, in elevating the price of gold; but if a broker, having in his possession gold which is his own undisputed property, and upon which he has the same right to fix a price that any other person has to fix a price upon any commodity which he may possess, then he is inflicting a mortal injury upon the circulation, running up prices, starving the community, betraying the cause of his country, &#x0026;c., as if his act were not the direct and inevitable consequence of the action of the <name>Treasury</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> What is an extortioner?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Is a miller who gives <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">five dollars</measure> a bushel for wheat and sells his flour for <measure n="30dollars" type="currency">thirty dollars</measure> a barrel &mdash; which hardly pays expenses we should think &mdash; an extortioner?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Would a flour merchant, who made his living by his trade in flour, and who had a <measure n="1000barrels" type="mass">thousand barrels</measure> of flour in his store at the commencement of the rise in prices, be esteemed an extortioner because having purchased for <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6dollars" type="currency">six dollars</measure> a barrel he is unwilling to sell at <num value="7">seven</num> or <num value="8">eight</num>, because he knows that when all is sold he cannot purchase a fresh stock for less than <num value="25">twenty-five</num> or <num value="30">thirty</num>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>We are not defending extortioners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>If any man be convicted of that crime let him be punished to the extent of the law, if there be any law to punish him, and if there be not let <num value="1">one</num> be passed to cover all future cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>But <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> let the offence be clearly defined, so that the offender may understand of what he is guilty, and the really innocent be enabled to clear his skirts of the charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>We think it perfectly evident that every man is the creature of the market in which he trades, and that he can neither oversell it nor undersell it, how much so ever he may desire to do so. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> We are not the advocate of any of the classes of presumed offenders enumerated in the foregoing remarks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>But we are the friend of fair play, and we cannot endure to see <num value="1">one</num> man made to bear the burden of another man's sin. The offences of which we have written are all the offspring of the depreciated currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Amend that and they will cease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>In the meantime let the depreciation be laid at <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> the right door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>If the excessive issues which have degraded the currency were necessary to prosecute the war, very well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>But do not attribute them to persons who, to say the worst, have only taken advantage of them to make money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>That was to have been expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>It has always been so, and it always will be so. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>At the same time there arrived at the headquarters of the division an order from the <orgName n="Department of Henrico" type="department">Department of Henrico</orgName> directing that these men, charged with desertion and the murder of <persName n="Mallett,Adjutant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Mallett,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Adjutant">Adjutant</roleName> <surname>Mallett</surname></persName>, be executed at such time and place as the division commander should direct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>From division headquarters an order was immediately issued to have the execution take place at <time value="4oclock">4 o'clock</time> on the following day. At <time value="3:30oclock">half past 3 o'clock</time> on the afternoon of the <num value="5" type="ordinal">5th</num> the troops of the division were promptly formed on <num value="3">three</num> sides of a square, with side arms and without colors, whilst <num value="10">ten</num> stakes ranged in a row on the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> side showed where the execution would take place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>A few minutes later the prisoners arrived upon the ground, preceded by the officer of the day, the music of the brigade playing the dead march, and escorted by a detail from the brigade guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The bearing of the prisoners was calm and self-possessed, and they marched to the place of their execution with a step as accurate in its cadence as that of the guard who conducted them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> On arriving upon the grounds the prisoners here fronted to the division, who had been paraded to witness their death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The officer of the day read the orders reciting their offences, their sentences, and the time and place of their execution.--This ceremony concluded, the <rs>Chaplain</rs> of the <orgName type="regiment" key="3NCInfantry">3d N.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The prisoners joined in the act of devotion with fervor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The soldiers who were there to witness the execution of their comrades, used as they were to the blood and carnage of <num value="20">twenty</num> battle fields, beheld with uncontrollable emotion the solemn preparation for the execution of the condemned, and seemed to be penetrated with the solemnity of the religious services which were being carried on. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/> The services over the <rs>Chaplain</rs> blessed and affectionately bid adieu to each prisoner &mdash; the non-commissioned officers of the <num value="10">ten</num> different firing parties rapidly carried the prisoners each to his own stake, where, after kneeling, their arms were pinioned behind the stake and their eyes bandaged to shut out the sight of the muzzles of the muskets levelled not more than <num value="10">ten</num> paces from them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> At this part of the proceedings, and whilst the firing parties were being deployed into <num value="1">one</num> rank, the more effectually to deliver their fire, the prisoners broke out into loud and frequent appeals to the <name>Almighty</name> to have mercy on their souls and pardon their sins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>The preparations being concluded, the officer of the day gave the command &#x0022;ready!&#x0022; and the clicking of the locks alone broke the silence that prevailed; &#x0022;aim!&#x0022; and the muzzles of the guns were pointed with unerring aim at the breasts of the miserable condemned, and the very breathing of the crowd seemed stopped in a terrible suspense; &#x0022;fire!&#x0022; and the corpses of <num value="10">ten</num> men hung in the horrible relaxation of death to the stakes where they were pinioned. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> The troops of the division filed by the dead bodies in melancholy procession, and the field, being vacated by all but the detail for burial, was as silent and solemn in the evening gloom as the painful scene of which it had been the theatre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>So perish those who would betray their country in its hour of need and peril.
