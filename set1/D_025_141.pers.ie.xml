<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/> The <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, referring to these characters in his report, says that the effective force of the army is but little over half or <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of the men whose names are on the muster rolls. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/> An astounding state of things, indeed.--What are we to think of the discipline of the army?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>What are we to expect in the future, if such evils are to remain unchecked?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>And some members of Congress talk of extending the conscript age, and making a levy <hi rend="italics">en masse</hi> of the people, (when the present number of exempts cannot provide food for the remainder,) in order to make up the deficiencies arising from the straggling, absenteeism, and desertion of men whose presence in the army would make it large enough for all practical purposes? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/> Is not the obvious remedy to bring back the stragglers, absentees, and deserters, and make them perform their duty, instead of enlarging the limits of conscription, only to engender a fresh batch of stragglers, absentees, and deserters more numerous than the last?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>If military discipline cannot keep men of the present military age in the army, how is it to keep those who are not half so fit for service?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>We should be sorry indeed to believe that the present evil cannot be remedied, for it is an evil that will increase instead of diminish, by putting men in the army whose prime of life has past, and whose home ties are stronger and more pressing than those of younger men who have no <num value="1">one</num> dependent on their exertions.--For our own part, we believe that if Congress will devote a very moderate degree of attention to the maturing of measures for the return of stragglers, deserters, and absentees to the army, it will accomplish a <num value="100">hundred</num>-fold more for the efficiency of our army and the success of our cause than it ever could by a levy <hi rend="italics">en masse</hi> of the people. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/> The crime of straggling, absenteeism, and desertion from the <rs>Southern</rs> army, are in finitely more scandalous and infamous than the same officers in the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/> When a people or a party have determined upon a great crime, it is their invariable rule, as attested by all history, to charge upon those whom they mean to destroy some enormity which will justify their premeditated wickedness in the eyes of the world and make it appear righteous retribution.--The moral sense of mankind would not brook open and undisguised persecution and plunder, and therefore it has always been found necessary to have a plausible pretext, which will convert the intended villainy in the eyes of the world into a virtue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>The <rs n="Jewish" type="religion">Jews</rs>, before they put to death the <rs>Divine Founder</rs> of Christianity, raised an outcry against him of being a leader of sedition, and of endeavoring to overturn the <rs>Government</rs> of C&#x0153;sar, although, in point of fact, nothing would have recommended him to them as much as the very offence with which they charged him before Pilate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>In like manner the ancient heathen sought to justify their persecution of the early Christians by accusing them of eating human flesh at their religious celebrations.
