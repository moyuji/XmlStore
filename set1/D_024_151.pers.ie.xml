<head>The rumored raid yesterday</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> In another column will be found some account of a rumored <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> raid on <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and a statement of the facts concerning it. The account also shows that our militia force here is a strong, and, if properly organized, will be an important, addition to the forces already around the city, should its aid ever be wanted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> It is, indeed, high time that every man in the community who is capable of military duty should be prepared for service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The force which now threatens the city is not able to fight its way to it through the troops that can be opposed to it. But we know not how soon, or to what extent they may be reinforced, or how soon the reinforcements may arrive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>It is, therefore, of the last importance that we should be in a condition to send every regular soldier now in the city forthwith to the field, retaining not even <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num></hi> man for the purposes of a guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>That duty, at least, should be performed by citizens, who are as competent to discharge it as the best disciplined veterans in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Nor need they stop at this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>They may be placed in the batteries, which, with the natural aptitude of their race for fire arms of every description, they can manage as well as the most experienced artillerists in the <rs>French</rs> army, which we take to be the finest of which there is any account.--Is a very short time they will become practiced soldiers in all the arms of the service &mdash; infantry, artillery, and cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Their example should be sedulously inculcated upon the surrounding districts, which, upon an emergency, and with a few days' notice, could send as an army of <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> men, admirable horsemen, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> rate shots, every way fitted to annoy, harass, and break the spirit of an advancing foe before he comes in contact with the regular force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Such a body of troops would prove invaluable auxiliaries, like the <rs>Prussian Landwehr</rs>, the <rs>Russian Cossacks</rs>, and the <rs>French</rs> <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">levee en masse,</hi></foreign> and we hope this proclamation of the <rs>Governor</rs>'s will lay the foundation of a general organization. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> Indeed, this is not the time to trifle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Our people have become so accustomed to alarms, and even to actual danger, that they have grown callous, and refuse to be roused by the most startling intelligence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>We are happy to see that they manifested yesterday a disposition to shake off this lethargy, but they still require all the stimulant that can be furnished by precept and example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>They had as well know now as hereafter, when it is too late, that not a man will be withdrawn from <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Harry,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> to reinforce the troops before this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>That army has its allotted task, and nothing that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> can do will divert it from its line of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>We are amply able, with the assistance of the troops around the city, to repel, and punish severely, any force that is likely to appear in our front within any short space of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>In the meantime, it is hardly probable that any serious attempt will be made with a force of less than <num value="50000">50,000</num> men. Before the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> can collect such a force we shall have <num value="1">one</num> quite equal to it, and without robbing <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Harry,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> of a man. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> Let us conclude this article by entreating our citizens not to wait until the enemy are upon us; but to organize at once, and our authorities to compel an organization, if they have the power and the citizens prove refractory. </p> </div3>

<head><placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> From the article which we republish this morning from the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName> it is evident that a serious attempt is about to be made to wrest this portion of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> from our grasp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>It is, meanwhile, a most important possession for us in more respects than <num value="1">one</num>.--It is more productive of the necessaries of life than almost any other district under our command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>It commands some of our most important communications, which cannot be abandoned to the enemy without subjecting us to extreme inconvenience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>It is <num value="1">one</num> of the strongest countries in the world; so strong, indeed that it was called by <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Scott,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>, who surveyed it many years ago, the <rs>Switzerland</rs> of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>If taken from us we shall find it extremely difficult to recover it. On the other hand, its remarkable adaptation to defensive operations induces us to hope that it cannot be taken from us. <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> tells us that the assailant, in mountain warfare, always labors under a disadvantage, and that a General who conducts a campaign against an army having possession of such a country ought always to man&#x0153;uvre so as to make the enemy attack <hi rend="italics">him,</hi> and never if he can avoid it, to attack the enemy.--So great an advantage does the possession of such a country offer that he believed it, in the sands of a skillful General, capable of counterbalancing almost any deficiency in numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The history of <placeName key="tgn,7011731" n="1.000 54" reg="switzerland">Switzerland</placeName> abundantly sustains this opinion, if, indeed, the opinion of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> upon a military subject requires any support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>That people, although quarrelling among themselves, for centuries maintained their independence against the great powers that lay on the <rs>North</rs> and. West of their mountains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Neither <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> nor <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> was ever able to subdue them, and <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName></persName> the <name>Bold</name>, though the most warlike prince of his day, was overthrown on the bloody field of <placeName key="tgn,7007425" n="1.000 1" reg="murten,bern,schweiz,europe">Morat</placeName> with more than <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of his army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The <rs>English</rs> tried for several centrueis to conquer <placeName key="tgn,7002444" n="1.000 148" reg="scotland">Scotland</placeName>, and they often drove the whole population from the plain to the mountains; but beyond that point they could not penetrate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The wave of <name>English</name> invasion broke and scattered against the sterile rocks of the <rs n="Scotch" type="political">Scottish</rs> Highlands. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> Now, we are very strongly of the opinion that <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> is not the man to conduct a mountain campaign, or indeed any other sort of campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>He owes his present situation to the mean-spirited confessions which he made after the <rs n="Battle of Fredericksburg" type="battle">battle of Fredericksburg</rs>, when he sought to relieve <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> of all blame for the catastrophe, and took it upon himself.--<persName n="Buckner,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Buckner,S.,B.,,:1"><surname>Buckner</surname></persName> is a man of courage and talent, as he has abundantly shown in this war, and being in possession of the country he can, and doubtless will, make use of its capabilities to the greatest advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>He will compel <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> to attack him, and he will not receive his attack, unless in such a position as to render victory absolutely certain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Notwithstanding the bluster of the <hi rend="italics">Herald,</hi> therefore, we entertain no fears that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> will be able to subdue <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>, assisted though they may be by the traitors who swarm throughout that region.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>There is a short and sure way to deal with them, and with that way <persName n="Buckner,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Buckner,S.,B.,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Buckner</surname></persName> is no doubt well acquainted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The idea of preventing reinforcements from going to <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName> is preposterous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The reinforcements will have gone before <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> gets there, and enough will have been left to take care of him. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> The news continues to be good from this city, as will be seen by reference to our telegraphic columns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The capture of <num value="50">fifty</num> wagons loaded with provisions is a very serious matter to <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> just at this moment. </p> </div3> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<div3 type="article" n="4"> 
<head>The Peace sentiment in the <rs>North</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> We have never been disposed to overrate the importance of the <name>Peace</name> party in the <name>North</name> or <name>North</name>west.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Our reasons for this have been too often given to bear recapitulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>But we are equally well satisfied that it is the policy of the <rs>South</rs> to encourage disaffection to the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> Government, in whatever shape it shows itself or from whatever motive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Admitting it to be true that Northern <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrat</rs> oppose the war from party motives, and Northwestern <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs> from considerations of commercial interest, then we say lot us, as far as we can, abstain from throwing ridicule upon that opposition, and encourage as far as we can everything that will divide the <rs>North</rs> and set the people against a fanatical Government which is doing them far more injury than it can do us. Our forefathers did not inquire too closely into the motives of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> when she came to the aid of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> in the <name>Revolution</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>It would have been very absurd in them to have thrown in the teeth of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> what was undoubtedly true, that, in espousing the cause of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Colonies, she was influenced more by hatred of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> than love of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>She was looking after her interests, not ours; but it would have been very ridiculous to tell lier so. Nations do not go counselling in these days, but follow their interests; and if the interests of any section or party in the <rs>North</rs> point to peace, let us by all means bid them <name n="God" type="God">God</name> speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Let us make their interests more palpable to them by a vigorous prosecution of the war, and let us give them distinctly to understand that reconstruction is a thing not to be dreamed of; but, at the same time, let us not throw cold water upon their attempts to overthrow the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> despotism at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>For our own part, we believe the masses at the <rs>North</rs> are heartily tired and sick of the war, but the military tyranny of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> has hitherto rendered powerless their aspirations for peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>It is not for us, however, to discourage them in their struggles for deliverance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>We should help them with a few more victories, and the balls and bayonets of our brave soldiers are the best reliance for bringing about this object. </p> </div3>

<head>Garden seed.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> Oar people have heretofore relied so much upon Northern seed men for their garden seed that they have not been in the habit of saving them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>That source of supply happily being cut off, unless a little care be taken by our citizens to save seed enough there will be a great scarcity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>This year there were not enough good seed to supply the demand, and old and defective stocks were brought into market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Much disappointment and loss has been the consequence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Every farmer and gardener should take, care to save as great a variety and as large a quantity as he can. Thus he will be sure of enough for himself, and may help to supply those who are not fortunate enough to succeed in their efforts, or who are new beginners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>It is, moreover, important that each cultivator should be able to exchange seeds with his neighbor, since those not grown on his place will generally thrive better than those that are. Above all, if we supply ourselves we are sure of good seed; whereas if we rely upon the precarious chances of blockade runners and irresponsible persons we shall continue to be deceived with defective seeds and with seed that turn out to be those of a very different vegetable from that they are represented to be, as many cultivators can testify. </p> </div3>
