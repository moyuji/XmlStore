<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>The fact of the case is, this list is made up entirely from gleanings from the newspapers gathered here and there, and then summed up as any skillful and energetic editor knows well how to do.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>Ordinarily <num value="0.07">seven per cent.</num> of the population of a country is the number that can be taken for soldiers without damage to its commercial and agricultural interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>It was thought that a <num value="0.1">ten per cent.</num> ratio could be adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>The recent list is hut a rehash of the old <num value="1">one</num>, giving such additional facts as have been gained by close study of Southern journals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>It will be observed that the <rs>Virginia</rs> regiments are given more accurately than any other, and that the <rs>Louisiana</rs> regiments are published under the same organization they came into the service with, while we know that there is scarcely <num value="1">one</num> that has been unchanged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>The reason for this is because the <rs>Virginia</rs> papers have been received with more regularity than those from the extreme <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/> The painful intelligence of the stupendous conflagration in the beautiful city of <placeName reg="Charleston, Kanawha, West Virginia" key="tgn,7013583">Charleston</placeName> elicits the profound sympathy of a large number of our citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>The destruction of splendid public buildings, and of beautiful and costly private residences by the <num value="100">hundred</num>--whole streets of valuable property amounting to <num value="1000000">millions</num>, rendering many hundreds of people penniless and shelterless, are great calamines, and well calculated to call forth the sincerest commiseration of every man whose heart beats with sympathetic emotion for the woes, allocations and losses of his fellow-men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>But <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> and <placeName reg="Portsmouth, Portsmouth, Virginia" key="tgn,7014278">Portsmouth</placeName> are largely indebted to <placeName reg="Charleston, Kanawha, West Virginia" key="tgn,7013583">Charleston</placeName>, whose whole-souled and noble-spirited citizens so promptly sent aid of the most valuable kind as soon as the cry for help went forth from the stricken cities Physicians of distinction; gentlemen of character, talent, and wealth, nurses, servants, medicines, sweetmeats, delicacies, and gold, came quickly from that handsome, enterprising, and hospitable, though now afflicted city of the <rs>Sunny South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>Now large numbers of her people are rendered destitute by the sea of fire that has swept in terrific waves of flame through a rich and beautiful part of the metropolis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>They ask not yet for help in their deep distress, though men, women, and little children are without food and covering in winter time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>The chivalrous <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">State of South Carolina</placeName> will promptly aid her chief city; other States, too, and the <rs>Confederacy</rs> will doubtless help those whom the flames have hurried from their homes at the midnight hour and deprived of every comfort; but a special obligation rests upon these seaboard cities of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and I doubt not judicious and early action will be taken by those in authority to give the citizens an opportunity to show, in a substantial way, their appreciation of past and inestimable favors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>The action, in fact, commenced on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time> between the pickets; and this contradicts the statement previously made that the enemy approached from the rear and front, turning both our flanks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/> <num value="1">One</num> great advantage that the <rs>Federals</rs> possessed was a position behind some felled timber at a convenient distance from our camp, where they were well protected from our fire, and had a good opportunity of picking off our men whenever they showed themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/>It is represented to have been a moment of terrible excitement; but the troops and their brave commander proved equal to the emergency.
