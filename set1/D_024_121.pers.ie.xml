<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>He has therefore become his imitator, and is rising in the popular scale along with him Humiliated and disgraced by his failures on the <rs>Potomac</rs>, he finds a malicious satisfaction, as well as a facite way of lifting himself up in Yankeedom, in issuing inhuman and bloody orders against all sympathizers with the men whose valor and skill in arms drove him in disgrace from the battle-field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Safely ensconced in his headquarters, in his own country, he is doing a slashing business among those who, through the agency of his spies and informers, incur the penalties of his orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>It is a public body, in which is vested a portion of the civil power of the <rs>State</rs>, to be exercised for the purposes of local government through its several branches &mdash; legislative, executive, and judicial &mdash; a kind of <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">imperium imperio</hi></foreign>--reflecting in miniature in its relations with the local constituent body the government of the <rs>State</rs> itself in its relations with the great body of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>Its business is to institute and enforce all proper measures, according to the prescriptions and limitations of its charter, for the good government of the city; and, when that is done with the best judgment its members can bring to the task, their functions are appropriately discharged and at an end. For its proper performance they are, like the members of the <rs>State</rs> government, amenable to popular censure at the polls, and, in cases of willful and corrupt misconduct, to criminal prosecution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>Among the numerous provisions of the charter, I find nothing express or implied to warrant the idea that such liability exists, nor have I met with any reported care or text writer which recognizes any such incident as pertaining to corporate municipal bodies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>Thus in the case of <persName n="Prather,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00291" reg="mostcommon:Prather,nomatch:0"><surname>Prather</surname></persName> vs the city of <placeName reg="Lexington, Lexington, Virginia" key="tgn,7013889">Lexington</placeName> (<num value="3" type="ordinal">3rd</num> B <persName n="Monroe,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00292" reg="mostcommon:Monroe,nomatch:0"><surname>Monroe</surname></persName>, <num value="559">559</num>) in which it was sought to make the city liable for injuries to property within its limits committed by a lawless mob, the <rs type="place">Court</rs> says: <q>&#x0022;We know of no principle of law that subjects a municipal corporation to a responsibility for the safety of the property within its territorial limits, nor has any case been cited in which such a principle has been recognized or established.--If such a liability exists, what is its nature and extent?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>Does it afford protection against the acts of the incendiary and the midnight depredator, or only against the violence of a lawless mob?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>If against the latter only, whence arises the distinction?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>All the acts may be alike injurious, and if the corporation must secure the property of its members in all events, against all unlawful violence, there is no room for discrimination, but a similar liability would exist in each of the cases mentioned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>There is nothing in the nature or design of a municipal corporation that imposes such a duty upon it. The chief purpose of such an institution is the adoption of such measures of police as will promote the comfort, convenience and general welfare of the inhabitants within the city, and by local laws adapted to the condition of a dense population, to impart efficiency to the local government.&#x0022;</q> Against the necessity which was felt in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> for special legislation on this subject, and by which such liability has been imposed on local communities as hundreds, town and cities, shows that by common law (which in this instance is ours) it was not incidental to common municipal bodies, as such.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>From an early period in the <rs>English</rs> law, the hundreds into which the counties were divided were by statutes made liable to persons robbed within the limits, under certain circumstances, in damages equivalent to the loss sustained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>These enactments have been greatly extended in modern times, in their corp and objects; until now, by the riot act the black act, as it is called, and others <unclear>scullery,</unclear> there is scarcely any injury to property committed in a violent and tumultuous manner, that may not be redressed in that country by action against the <num value="100">hundred</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>To these may be added the <num value="57" type="ordinal">57th</num> <persName n="Geo,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00293" reg="nearbymention:Geo,Lt,,,"><surname>Geo</surname></persName>. <num value="3">III</num>, ch <num value="19">19</num> sec <num value="38">38</num> against injuries by tumultuous assemblies, making the <hi rend="italics">city or town</hi> liable if not within a <num value="100">hundred</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>But we have no such legislation here. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/> I do not know that it is claimed by those who are asking redress by the city for losses inflicted by the late riot, that those losses have arisen from the failure of the <name>Council</name> to take proper measures or of the officers of the city property and faithfully to exert themselves, to prevent and suppress the riot; but in neither aspect of the case do I consider the city liable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>The Council, it is true, by the charter, must &#x0022;adopt measures to suppress riots, gaming and tippling houses,&#x0022; &#x0026;c. They have the power to impose fines, within a certain limit, and they have the appointment of officers of police &mdash; not the <rs>Mayor</rs>, however, nor the <rs>Captain</rs> of the <rs n="night watch" type="product">Night Watch</rs>--the principal officers, who are elected by the people, and they may define and prescribe the duties of these officers, --but these are public duties of a legislative nature, for the proper discharge of which the members are responsible only in their political, representative character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>In this, they are to be distinguished in their action from members of a private corporation; for &#x0022;private corporations, exercising the corporate functions <hi rend="italics">for the benefit of the members,</hi> are liable to individuals for an omission or misfeasance of those functions; otherwise, of public corporations, instituted for purposes of government, unless an action be given against them by statute.&#x0022; While vs <orgName n="City Council" type="council">City Council of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName></orgName>, <num value="2">2</num> <persName n="Hitt,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00294" reg="mostcommon:Hitt,nomatch:0"><surname>Hitt</surname></persName>, R.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>Neither would any delinquency of duty on the part of the police, in preventing or suppressing the riot occasioning the loss complained of, render the city liable; for these officers, although appointed by the <name>Council</name> &mdash; and a <hi rend="italics">portion,</hi> the <name>Kayor</name> and <rs type="role2">Captain</rs> of the <rs n="night watch" type="product">Night Watch</rs>, who are not so appointed &mdash; do not bear to the city the relation of <hi rend="italics">agents</hi> to a principal who is liable for their acts. &#x0022;The officers of a city are <hi rend="italics">quast</hi> <rs type="role" reg="civil-Officer">civil officers</rs> of the <rs>Government</rs>, although appointed by the corporation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>They are personally liable for their malfeasance or nonfeasance in office; but for neither is the corporation liable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>Omissions of a duty imposed upon them by law productive of injury to an individual are not a corporate injury. &#x0022; &#x0022;The corporation appoints them to office; but does not, in that act, sanction their official misconduct.&#x0022; <persName n="Prather,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00295" reg="mostcommon:Prather,nomatch:0"><surname>Prather</surname></persName> vs City of <placeName reg="Lex">Lex</placeName> <num value="563">563</num> sup. &#x0022;Because the corporation is as to the passages of ordinances and the appointment of officers, a <hi rend="italics">Government</hi> exercising political power, it is irresponsible for the official misconduct of his officers upon the name principle which generally protects Governments and public officers from liability for the malfeasance and malfeasance of persons necessarily employed under them in the public service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>But a municipal charter being in derogation of common right, is a system of strictly delegated powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>The power of making by laws is unquestionably an incident to the very existence of a corporation, though it is rarely left to implication, but is usually conferred by the express terms of the charter, and when the charter enables a corporation to make by laws in certain cases and for certain purposes, its powers of legislation is limited to the cases and objects specified, all others being excluded by implication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>To raise and appropriate money is among the powers to be thus exercised, but this must be done merely to effectuate the object specified in the charter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>In our charter these objects are all defined &mdash; among which is the care of the poor &mdash; but, as a class, defined and regulated by law, and not embracing individuals whose means may have been more or less affected by the vicissitudes of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>To be sure, in a recent amended charter of the city the enumerations of the granted powers is accompanied by some very general language, descriptive of the <rs>Council</rs>'s authority to pass by-laws &#x0022;which they shall deem necessary for the peace, comfort, convenience, good order, <hi rend="italics">good morals,</hi> health or safety of said city, or of the people or property therein;&#x0027; but then, by a well established rule of construction, there general expressions are to be construed with reference to the restrictive character of the instrument, and the subjects embraced by them must be germane to the objects and purposes of the powers expressly granted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>They cannot mean that the <name>Council</name> must undertake to perform for the citizen those duties of imperfect obligation &mdash; such as personal charity and compassion for the subjects of undeserved misfortune and pecuniary distress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>Cases, indeed, have occurred in the proceeding; of public corporations, of expenditures for purposes very alien to the objects of their institutions, and they have passed unchallenged, because they accorded with the feelings and sentiments of the tax-paying community; but, when brought to the test of judicial inquiry they have been condemned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>Thus, it has been decided that a town corporation could not appropriate money to defray the expenses of a <date value="07-04">fourth of July</date> celebration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>And where a city undertook to pay the costs of a litigation in which it was no party, and not legally liable, although it was supposed to involve the feelings and wishes of its citizens, its drafts for the amount of the costs were held to be void.
