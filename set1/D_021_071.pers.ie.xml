<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>He lived by faction the had neither the wisdom to support nor the manliness to put an end to the war in the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>, and his crooked, contemptible policy was shown by withholding what was necessary to sustain the contest, and throwing on the <rs>General</rs> the responsibility of failure.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="Premier"></bibl></cit>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The defence was of a character so personal, that <persName n="Napier,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Napier,nomatch:0"><surname>Napier</surname></persName> challenged the younger <rs>Percival</rs>, and when his challenge was not accepted, he poured out the vials of his wrath of the memory of the father with tenfold bitterness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The horribly wicked prohibition upon the introduction of medicine into <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, at the time it was suffering from pestilence, formed the chief burden of his denunciation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>And justly it did so for what can be conceived more utterly diabolical, than such a war with the sick and the dying &mdash; with the mother and the infant at her breast &mdash; with a whole people combatants and non-combatants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>We believe it is some where mentioned that the godly <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritans</rs> of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, who claimed that all the earth belonged to the <name>Saints</name>, and that they were the <name>Saints</name>, once took occasion to establish their claims to the lands of certain <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> tribes by sending the small-pox among them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>We know not how much truth there may be in the charge, for we thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name> we have never wasted time in perusing the annals of that detestable race, who appear to have been capable of every crime, from murder to petty larceny; but it bears a strict analogy to this offence of the <rs>British Minister</rs>, For the honor of human nature, when we <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> read the paragraph quoted above, we were induced to hope that, as the crime had no parallel in past history, so it would never find imitators in the future.--We were mistaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, the most prompt imitators of everything, unless it happens to be something that has a touch of benevolence in it, have taken the worst Minister that has flourished in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> since, the reign, of <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName> <genName n="2">II</genName></persName>, for a model.

<head>The policy of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> The conviction is daily acquiring strength that the policy of the <rs>English Government</rs>, upon the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> question is far more profound and subtle <unclear></unclear>looking at the surface of things, had supposed.--It is now beginning to be believed that the controlling motive of the <rs>British Government</rs>, in its long and persevering career of anti-slavery propagandism, was, through the abolition of slave labor in the <rs>South</rs>, so to cripple and destroy the cotton culture in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> as to make the world dependent for its manufactures upon the cotton productions of <name>British</name> colonies, which, though not equal to those of the <rs>South</rs>, would be the best that could be had, after Southern cotton is out of the way. This conjecture is the only <num value="1">one</num> that harmonizes with the course of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> before and during the present war. That her abolition influence, more than any other cause, has produced the disruption of the old Union, no <num value="1">one</num> doubts; but if she sought disunion, in order, as we have hitherto supposed, to obtain control of Southern staples, it is impossible to comprehend why she should have so long hesitated to break the blockade, and should still encounter the hazard of the whole cotton crop being destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Her conduct is only to be explained by the supposition that she desires the destruction of Southern labor and Southern staples, that her own may take their places, Such a profound, subtle, and cold-blooded policy, is in entire keeping with the whole course of the same Government upon slavery and the slave trade, of which she was at <num value="1">one</num> time the principal patron; but, as soon as her interests, changed, the most bitter and efficient adversary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Slavery she forced upon <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, to subserve her own interests, and slavery, for the same purpose, she is now laboring to extirpate root and branches. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> The policy which it is now believed governs <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, will prove as short-sighted as it is supremely selfish and inhuman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Even in the improbable contingency of Southern subjugation, the cotton of the <rs>South</rs>, if ever raised thereafter, would still hold its supremacy in all the markets of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>If successful &mdash; as who can doubt?--the manufacturers of continental nations would be able, by the use of our Southern staple and by the commercial privileges which they would receive in preference to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, either to overthrow forever the manufacturing ascendancy of that nation, or compel her to acknowledge that the cotton of the <rs>South</rs> is <persName n="King,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:King,nomatch:0"><surname>King</surname></persName>. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Still she came on the balls bouncing from her mailed sides like <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName> rubber, apparently making not the least impression, except to out off her flagstaff, and thus bring down the <rs>Confederate</rs> colors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>None of her crew ventured at that time on her outside to replace them, and she fought thenceforward with only her pennant flying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>She appeared to obey her helm and be very readily handled, making all her movements and evolutions with apparent facility and readiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>We had probably fired <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> broadsides when a shot was received from <num value="1">one</num> of her guns which <measure n="5" type="killed">killed five</measure> of our marines. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> It was impossible for our vessel to get out of her way, and the <rs>Merrimac</rs> soon crashed her iron horn or ram into the <rs>Cumberland</rs> just starboard the main choice; under the bluff of the port bow, knocking a hole in the side, near the water line, as large as the head of a hogs head, and driving the vessel back upon her anchors with great force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The water came rushing into the hold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>The <rs>Merrimac</rs> then backed out and discharged her guns at us, the shot passing through the main bay and killing <measure n="5" type="sick">five sick</measure> men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>In the meantime her broadsides swept our men away, killed and maimed, and also set our vessel on fire in the forward part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>That fire was extinguished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>I cannot tell how many were wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>The sick bay, berth deck and gun desk were almost literally covered with men killed and wounded; but the surviving ones still fought well, and every <num value="1">one</num>, officers and men, displayed the utmost heroism. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/> The fight lasted about <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> of an hour, the <rs>Cumberland</rs> firing rapidly and all the time, the water pouring in the hold, and by and by the ports, as her how kept sinking deeper and deeper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Near the middle of the fight, when the berth deck of the <rs>Cumberland</rs> had sunk below water, <num value="1">one</num> of the crew of the <rs>Merrimac</rs> came out of a port to the outside of her iron-plated roof, and a ball from <num value="1">one</num> of our guns instantly cut him in <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>That was the last and only Confederate that ventured within sight, the rest remained in their safe, iron-walled enclosure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>We fired constantly, and the <rs>Merrimac</rs> occasionally, but every shot told upon our Wooden vessel and brave crew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>Her guns being without the least elevation, pointed straight at us along the surface of the water, and her nearness, she being much of the time within <measure n="300yards" type="distance">three hundred yards</measure>, made it an easy matter to send each ball to its exact mark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Probably her guns would be useless at a considerable distance, as it appears impossible to elevate them. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>The Monitor in turn determined to try her force in a similar operation, but in some unaccountable manner the wheel or other steering apparatus became entangled, it is said, and the <rs>Monitor</rs> rushed by, just missing her aim. <persName n="Worden,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Worden,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Worden</surname></persName> is confident that he put <num value="3">three</num> shot through the ball of his antagonist &mdash; probably through the ports. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/> The Monitor fired <num value="178">178</num>-pound cast iron shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>The wrought-iron shot were not used, because their great weight and peculiar construction render the guns much more liable to burst.--The <rs>Merrimac</rs> fired about <num value="40">forty</num> shots on the <rs>Monitor</rs>, which replied unrapidly as possible, but so far as is known, neither vessel is damaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>The <rs>Merrimac</rs> is probably not injured &mdash; at least more than the starting of a plate or so of her iron covering &mdash; and her machinery being uninjured, she is probably fit to come out again.

I do not think the <rs>Merrimac</rs> is calculated to carry much coal, and that might have been a reason for her retiring from the contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>The Monitor perhaps might follow up the <name n="Confederate States">rebel</name> steamers and disable them, but if she gets among the rebel batteries, a heavy fire might be concentrated on her from different points, and she be thus injured; or possibly she might be grappled to and towed ashore.

<head>What is martial law?</head> <byline>[From the <orgName n="Memphis Appeal" type="newspaper">Memphis Appeal</orgName>.]</byline> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/> A considerable diversity of opinion prevails in regard to martial law, his character, extent, and instrumentalities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>Many persons suppose that military law is martial law. This is an error.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>The former is a code of laws prescribed for the government of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>It relates exclusively to persons attached to the military service, and does not, in its operations, embrace those engaged in ordinary civil employment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/> Martial law, on the contrary, embraces every description of persons within the city or district over which it had been established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>It is not defined and ascertained by enactments and judicial decisions, as in the case of military law, but springs from the will and judgment of the commandant whose duty it is to enforce it. It supercedes the ordinary instrumentalities of courts, such, as judges, juries, and sheriffs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>It may even suspend, for the time being, the great writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus.</hi> In other words, martial law may be said to be no law at all, but rather the will of the military commandant, regulated, it is true, by an enlightened regard for the general welfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>Its true intent and aim is to place all power, as well as all resources of the district, in the hands of the military authorities, to be used and wielded against the public enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/> It will thus be seen that the object had in view is the public weal, and that if we are restrained of any portion of our accustomed rights, it is done for our own good, as well as for the general safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>This consideration alone should reconcile as to any inconveniences that may result from the establishment of martial law. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/> It is proper to remark, however, that in the execution of martial law great prudence is to be exercised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/><persName n="Taney,Chief-Justice,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00237" reg="mostcommon:Taney,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Chief-Justice">Chief Justice</roleName> <surname>Taney</surname></persName> holds &#x0022;that no more force can be used than is necessary, and if the power be used for oppression, or any willful injury be done to person or property, the party by whom or whose order it is done, will be responsible to the injured person.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/> A review of the legal authorities would seem to conduct to the conclusion, that a military officer cannot declare martial law except over his own camp and its environs, and the near field of his military operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>Such was the opinion of <persName n="Woodbury,Judge,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00238" reg="mostcommon:Woodbury,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Woodbury</surname></persName>, who said: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/> &#x0022;My impression is, that a state of war, whether foreign or domestic, may enlist in the great peril of which it is competent under its rights and on principles of national law, for the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs> of troops, under the controlling government to extend certain right of war not only over his camp, but its environs, and the near field of his military operations, but no further or wider.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="Judge Woodbury"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/> The best opinion would seem to be that in time of war, the <rs>Government</rs>, by act of Congress, may place the country under martial law in a limited and mitigated sense; though there has been much controversy upon the limitation of the power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>So also, in the language of <persName n="Woodbury,Judge,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00239" reg="mostcommon:Woodbury,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Woodbury</surname></persName>, the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs> of troops may &#x0022;extend certain rights of war, not only over his camp, but the environs and the near field of his military operations.&#x0022; Beyond this, neither the <rs>Government</rs> nor the <rs type="role" reg="military-Commander">military commander</rs> can properly go. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/> Nothing but imminent peril to the army, arising from the near presence of the army, can authorize the commander to suspend or arrest the execution of ordinary civil process.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>In this, as in other respects, the safety of the army will be the ruling motive of the <rs type="role" reg="military-Commander">military commander</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/> As I believe you have done much service hitherto in calling attention to the various sources of saltpetre, both in your descriptions of the nitre beds of <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and <placeName reg="Germany" key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> and your notice of the nitrous earths of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Southwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName>, I shall venture to say, through your columns, that there is a gentleman in this vicinity who has discovered a mode by which he makes nitre in a very short time; much shorter than that of any of the methods mentioned in your article on nitre beds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>I have seen him scrape off from the sides of a glass vessel, containing a composition less than a week old, fine crystals of nitre, which on burning seemed to me to be exceedingly pure.

Tobacco was <num value="1">one</num> of the main ingredients used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>This. I believe, contain some saltpetre in its natural state, but it can very evidently be made to produce much more than it at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> contained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>I understand that with a plenty of nitre we may make not only a plenty of gunpowder, but by means of the nitric acid to be obtained from it can make as much gun-cotton as we choose for our torpedoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>How just and wonderful a dispensation it would be if the tobacco and cotton, which our enemies so much covet, should become not only a source of commercial greatness, but also of military strength, and prove in the hands of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> the very means of driving the invader from our soil </p>
