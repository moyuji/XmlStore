Military operations, political contests or financial difficulties have, severally, often given a special importance to the instalment of news; but never before has the confusion of the time been so vividly represented as by the brief outline we publish this morning of the events of a single week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>The invasion of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> by the <rs>Confederates</rs> is in itself but a repetition of their former aggressive movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>But the effects of this attack, and the spirit in which it is met, give the incursion a new significance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>It had &#x0022;assumed formidable proportions,&#x0022; and filled the <num value="3">three</num> chief cities of the <rs>North</rs> with alarm, extending even to New York. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>The danger is evident to the whole people of the <rs>North</rs>, but the reiterated appeal to them for the means of defence does not find the same response as before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>The people of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> itself cannot be relied on by the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, and would probably rather <unclear></unclear> the invasion than help to repel it. But the population of <placeName reg="Jersey" key="tgn,7005238">Jersey</placeName> and <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> are now described as apathetic and disinclined even to <unclear></unclear> months' service in the militia.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>The civic authorities of New York protest against the removal of the military from the city, apprehending the revival of a riotous spirit in the inhabitants if the troops are withdrawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>The Governor of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> is driven to word his proclamations to the people, not in the old terms of confidence and patriotism, but in the harsh language of reproach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>He actually accuses them of &#x0022;stupidity,&#x0022; and that &#x0022;culpable indifference&#x0022; which, in individuals, has been stigmatized as treason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>These are indications on the surface of some change that must have been silently working beneath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>We cannot hope that the <rs>Southern</rs> invasion will be a closing incident of <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> the war; but the different, or rather the abated, feeling it excites in the <rs>North</rs> gives some faint hope that a state of opinion is being created which will not howl down those who speak of peace as public enemies. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>In the lower classes of the community there appears to be beginning a dim consciousness of the real state of things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>The mass of the people have filled the ranks of the army again and again; they have fought bravely, and given their lives freely; but they cannot endure a continual effort that has no result, or brings only calamity, and they now begin to shrink from the useless sacrifice. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>The purchaser and the people had no fear that he would ever take the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>The city of <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName> has been held by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> for <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>In no instance did it bring <num value="1">one</num>- <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> part of its actual value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>The conclusion is irresistible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> entertain no hope of holding <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>As a particular case, we would mention the sale of <placeName reg="Freestone Point, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,2340005">Freestone Point</placeName>, the residence of <persName n="Fairfax,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00192" reg="nearbymention:Fairfax,Bryan,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Fairfax</surname></persName>--a magnificent estate &mdash; the very fishery upon which rented before the war for the interest upon <measure n="100000dollars" type="currency">$100,000</measure> in gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>Of course it was worth greatly more than that sum, for the rente would expect to make out of the fishery at least as much (clear gain) as he gave in the shape of rent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>Well, the whole <hi rend="italics">estate,</hi> land, houses, and fishery, sold the other day for the sum of <measure n="5000dollars" type="currency">$5,000</measure>--less than <num value="1">one</num> year's rent of the fishery alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>We may very fairly presume that the intruder expects to be ousted in a short time, and that he hopes to save himself by working the fishery in the interval to its utmost capacity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/> Such temporary occupation of the old mansions of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> would scarcely give occasion for more than a transient pang of regret were the occupants any other than <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>But <hi rend="italics">they,</hi> in the spirit of what they call improvement, never fail to vulgarize everything they touch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>Their's is a utilitarian spirit &mdash; a spirit which seeks the destruction of everything desirable or tasteful, provided, to use their own characteristic phrase, &#x0022;it don't pay.&#x0022; They cut down the most ancient and venerable shade trees to plant a few acres of corn or potatoes; destroy an old orchard to make a potato patch; pull down a venerable out-house to make room for some vulgar <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> money-making concern of their own &mdash; in a word, modernize and vulgarize everything so entirely that the place soon loses all the interest and respectability that result from antiquity and association of ideas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>We have no idea that <persName n="Fairfax,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00193" reg="nearbymention:Fairfax,Bryan,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Fairfax</surname></persName> will recognize his old home, endeared to him by a <num value="1000">thousand</num> memories of his ancestors, when they were almost princes in the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>In a word, all traces of the old house, of the old family, and of the old colonial days, gone forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>They took up all the headstones over the graves of the soldiers who fell at the siege of <placeName reg="York, York, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014650">York</placeName>, designing, no doubt, to exhibit them for pay, as they would exhibit a monkey or a rhinoceros, or as the <rs>Boston</rs> man exhibited the remains of old <persName n="Parkman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00199" reg="mostcommon:Parkman,nomatch:0"><surname>Parkman</surname></persName>, who was murdered some years ago by the amiable and philanthropic professor of chemistry in <orgName n="Harvard College" type="college">Harvard College</orgName> because he presumed to ask payment of a debt which had been long justly due. They steal pictures, too, to sell; and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> buy, because they read that to have pictures is an evidence of taste, just as they think it an evidence of learning to have a large library, although the majority of the books be nothing more than wood, with the title of a book printed on the back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>Of <rs type="color">silver</rs> and <rs type="color">gold</rs> utensils and ornaments, they, of course, know the value; and of carriages and horses no less, as <persName n="King,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00200" reg="mostcommon:King,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>King</surname></persName> proved at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> when he bought <persName n="Robb,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00201" reg="mostcommon:Robb,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Robb</surname></persName>'s carriage and horses for <measure n="50dollars" type="currency">fifty dollars</measure> from <persName n="Robb,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00202" reg="mostcommon:Robb,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Robb</surname></persName>'s servant, who had stolen them and run away, and when he not only rode in the carriage during the campaign, but sent it to New York for his wife and children to ride in also. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/> There is <num value="1">one</num> singular fact connected with our blockade-running vessels, to which, we think, the attention of the <orgName n="Navy Department" type="department">Navy Department</orgName> ought to be directed, if it has not already been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/> While the officers of the navy have been successful in <hi rend="italics">all</hi> their many trips except <num value="1">one</num>, every ship not commanded by an officer of the navy has been lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>The inference is irresistible.
