<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>In this order the bar was passed with safety and without detention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>The orders given to the commanders of the various vess's was to keep on straight up the harbor until they came within a <measure n="1000yards" type="distance">thousand yards</measure> of the forts, and then to attack, directing their efforts principally against <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/> In this order the fleet moved on steadily and gallantly up towards <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Forts Sumter</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Moultrie</placeName> the rebels withholding their fire until they got well up into the harbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>At this moment there seemed to be a temporary misunderstanding and from a fort erected on the middle ground the fire of from <num value="4">four</num> to <num value="500">five hundred</num> guns was concentrated in a terrible hall upon the devoted vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>Such a fire has never, perhaps, been equalled in the history of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>Into and on the latter fort a heavy fire was thus poured, and it is believed not without effect. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/> The engagement was kept up from <num value="1">one</num> until <time value="4oclock">four o'clock</time>, when, in obedience to the <rs>Admiral</rs>'s signal, the fleet retired slowly, receiving and returning the rebel fire until they anchored out of range, within the bar. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/> The <rs>Weehawken</rs> was assigned the important duty, which was faith fully performed in the midst of the fight, to examines, and if possible to fire, the obstructions which the rebels have extended across the harbor from <placeName reg="Fort Samtes">Forts Samtes</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Moultrie</placeName>.--Protected by the scow and the &#x0022;Devil&#x0022; in front of her, she pushed straight up towards the obstructions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/> They were found to consist of a net-work of chales and cables stretched across the harbor, over which it was impossible for the <rs>Weehawken</rs> to run without fooling her propeller, and which the found it impossible to force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>To this net-work the rebels are supposed to have suspended torpedoes and other submarine explosives. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/> Having completed the examination, and tested the impossibility of working up the harbor until means are devised for the removal of <unclear></unclear> obstructions, the <rs>Weehawken</rs> returned and reported to the <rs>Admiral</rs>, who then ordered a discontinuance of the conflict. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/> It is believed that the damage done to <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> by our fire was serious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>So far as it showed externally, it consisted in <num value="2">two</num> embrasures being knocked into <num value="1">one</num>, and numerous indentations in the wall which it is believed a few hours' more pounding would convert into a serious breach. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/> What damage and loss of life was sustained in the interior of the fort is not, of course, known; but it is believed to have been considerable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/> Beyond the sinking of the <rs>Keokuk</rs>, the damage to the iron clads was very slight, not more than would require <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure> to repair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>The war correspondent of the <orgName n="Charleston Courier" type="newspaper">Charleston <hi rend="italics">Courier</hi></orgName> gives some intelligence of affairs transpiring since the fight, which is interesting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>Yet it was even so, and at sundown the majority of the fleet were fading from view on the distant horizon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>The Ironsides was towed to her present anchorage, and <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Monitors</rs> was in the same manner conveyed from her moorings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/> Although an intelligent men, he tells some of the biggest lies that ever issued from the lips of mortal man and a careful examination only served to involve him in a tissue of fabrication; and exaggerations which spelled his entire story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>The statement he made is that none of the iron-clads were seriously damaged, and that the attack was designed simply to test the strength of the fort &mdash; a sort of <hi rend="italics">reconnaissance in force</hi>--and was regarded by naval men as eminently satisfactory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>They now feel assured of their ability to reduce <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> in <measure n="10hours" type="date">ten hours</measure> with <num value="2">two</num> iron-clads, an intend to do it. <persName n="McDonald,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00065" reg="nearbymention:McDonald,John,,,"><surname>McDonald</surname></persName> adds that they have altogether a fleet of <num value="12">twelve</num> Monitors, <num value="17">seventeen</num> or <num value="18">eighteen</num> vessels which are iron clad, and a large flotilla in the <rs>Edisto</rs>, on which are mounted the heaviest mortars. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/> With reference to the <rs>Keokuk</rs>, he states that her turret was not materially injured, and that she sank, not from the effect our fire, but from the concussion of her own guns, which &#x0022;broke her back.&#x0022; Such is the <name>Munchausen</name> account of the prisoner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>The only valuable part of it is that which refers to the concussion of the enemy's heavy guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>Taking the recent confession of a Northern correspondent, who was on the <rs>Montauk</rs> during the bombardment of <placeName key="tgn,2022925" n="1.000 25" reg="fort mcallister, bryan, georgia">Fort McAllister</placeName>, in connection with the above, the inference is almost conclusive that the <rs>Monitors</rs> cannot safely withstand the shock of their own guns sufficiently long for a protracted bombardment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>The effect on the systems of the men is not less than the effect on the vessels themselves, to that were it probable that the latter may hereafter be constructed in such a manner at to remove <num value="1">one</num> part of the difficulty, ventilation and personal concussion are <num value="2">two</num> obstacles that are insuperable in boats of that character.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/> The destruction of the <rs>Keokuk</rs> is by no means a satisfactory test of the strength of the other Monitors as the latter are constructed upon an entirely different principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>The <rs>Keokuk</rs> was an experiment, which failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>Had we sunk <num value="1">one</num> of the single-turreted monsters we should then have known something of the invulnerability of the others of her class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>As it is, we are as much in the dark as ever. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/> On Saturday the city was filled with conflicting rumors as to the sinking of the <rs>Ironsides</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>Several gentlemen, with good glasses, observing the ship from the cupola of the <rs type="place">Custom House</rs>, averred that she was surely setting by the store, while a dummy engine was seen briskly pumping out water, or lowering her guns to the boat which lay alongside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>No subsequent revelation has verified the correctness of these observations, however, and the probability is that the frigate is still comparatively sound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>If not, why is she outside the bar? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/> The firing on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time> about sundown is said to have been an effort by the enemy to shell <placeName reg="Morris Island, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2525074">Morris's Island</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/> The future movements of the float are enveloped in mystery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>It is barely supposable that after <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> of preparation the <name>Abolitionists</name> will be satisfied with the result of a <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> bombardment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>But they encountered what they did not fully anticipate, lost faith in their boasted prowess, and may have simply retired to gain strength and time, and organize another base of operations.--Perhaps they will now give <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> or <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName> a trial, hoping, if successful, to wipe out the disgrace of their present defeat, but that they will return to <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> eventually. </p> </div3>

<head>Provisions &mdash; prices &mdash; and Taxation.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/> Provisions are assuredly not in sufficient abundance to justify any waste or unnecessary consumption; but that they are as scarce as the high prices demanded for them would indicate is untrue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>There are enough in the country to support the army and the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>The scantiness of supplies in the principal markets are owing to <num value="3">three</num> causes, viz: The holding back for higher prices by some holders; the <rs>Government</rs> impressments of shipments on the way to market at prices <num value="2">two</num> <num value=".333">thirds</num> below the rates paid by the citizen, thus alarming producers and checking consignments; and the very bad condition of the roads, entirely obstructing transportation in many localities. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/> The extreme scantiness of supplies at the principal markets, and especially in this city, ran up the prices with amazing rapidity; and, as <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> fixed the prices or the country, they jumped up everywhere, just as they did here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>Every village, every cross-road; nay, every farm- house, established <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> prices, and the general fear that the <rs>Government</rs> would get the surplus on hand at lower rates, induced a system of hiding, and doling out in small lots from garrets and cuddles in a clandestine manner, to persons who would come in and go out covertly and do business more by means of knowing winks and nods than words. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/> Thus the constriction put upon the markets, regulating prices, roasted upon the rural districts, and the <rs>Government</rs>, seizing supplies at prices so much under the market rates, was itself out off by the hiding system from what it might have had at those rates. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/> This mistake of the <rs>Government</rs> worked an evil with many bad effects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>The Government ought to have governed prices for everybody, or have been itself governed by the prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>It is impossible to maintain <num value="2">two</num> sets; <num value="1">one</num> for itself and <num value="1">one</num> for the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>This has been plainly proven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>Had it paid the current rates, and as far as possible have allowed provisions to take their wanted route to the principal markets, prices would have been kept lower, the supplies would have been concentrated for easy distribution, and a better state of feeling would have prevailed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/> The law of impressment now in force will, we hope, improve the condition of things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>It is a concession on the part of the <rs>Government</rs> as to the necessity of recognizing the prevailing rules of valuation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>It had but <num value="1">one</num> alternative to this, and that was to establish or govern prices for the whole country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/> The great measure, however, in the hands of the <rs>Government</rs> is that of <hi rend="smallcaps">Taxation.</hi> That is the agent with which it may lift up its own present credit, and in a great degree check the ruinous and corrupt system of extortion and speculation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>This disease, which now so seriously effects the country, and threatens to embarrass the <rs>Government</rs> not a little, requires the most energetic treatment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>It is deep seated, and the knife should follow it to the very core. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/> The Government, in laying its tax, should be guided not only by its wants, but by the <hi rend="italics">general standard of values.</hi> If goods and produce, and if the fabrics of mechanical industry, are <num value="10">ten</num> times their ordinary value, then why not levy the tax in like proportion!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>So with <rs n="real estate" type="product">real estate</rs>, and all kinds of personal property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>This is the only made of absorbing the national currency, and diminishing its redundant circulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>This is the only mode of keeping up the <rs>Government</rs> credit. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/> If the <rs>Government</rs> has to pay the people <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="15">fifteen</num> times its value for every bushel of born or wheat or pound of bacon it buys for the army, then the people must pay the <rs>Government</rs> <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="15">fifteen</num> times more revenue in the form of taxation than they ever paid before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>It is plain that they are entirely able to do this, and we feel assured they are perfectly willing to do it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/> Congress certainly cannot hesitate in a matter so plain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>If that body will fulfill its entire duty to the country on this subject, it will not only do the greatest benefit to the <rs>Government</rs>, but to the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>It will keep down the circulation, maintain the public credit, check speculation, and restrain extortion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>It will be found that there is an end to the upward movement of prices, and that <sic>that</sic> end being reached they must inevitably come down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>Taxation is the regulator to bring this about.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>As long as we have a currency not convertible into gold, taxation is the only means by which these important objects can be practicably accomplished. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head>Supplies.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/> The roads have greatly improved; the restrictions upon transportation are relaxed, and the <rs>Government</rs> impressment bill proposes to pay valuation upon the basis of prevailing standards for what it requires; therefore, what of surplus there is in the country ought to seek the market in good time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>Certainly it can secure no advantage to the holder by being kept back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>It can be hardly possible that prices can go higher; and if anybody dreams that they will, there is every probability that he will be signally disappointed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>If holders are governed by a sound discretion, we are sure they will avail themselves of the opportunity afforded, and send what is perishable and what sells so enormously high at once to market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>If they act wisely, we doubt not the markets will be better supplied. </p> </div3>
