<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> A foreign publication gives an entertaining fancy sketch of a tiger hunt in <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName>, with sundry illustrations, in the best style of the art. The hero of the sketch is a tall, gaunt, firm- looking man, who is attended by a companion, low of stature, and who always keeps himself close behind the principal performer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>In <num value="1">one</num> of the hunts they manage to entrap a tiger in a hogshead, and to get his tail through the bung-hole, which they ingeniously contrive to fasten into a knot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The tiger, not liking his new quarters, proceeds to take up his line of march, --to secede, in short,--carrying the hogshead with him; while, to prevent the knot slipping, the tall man takes hold of the tail of the tiger, and the little man, to prevent accident to himself, grips firmly the tail of the tall man's coat.--The illustration which accompanies this scene is <num value="1">one</num> of the most laughter-moving of oddities in this line of humor which we have ever seen. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> Extremes are said to meet,--they certainly met in this instance,--and the farcical caricature might be made, with some modification, to illustrate a terrible tragedy in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>A tall man from <placeName reg="Kentucky, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> is enacting the part of the Nimrod-in-chief of a hunt on such a scale as <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName> never saw, while always behind him, close as his shadow, is a little man from New York, holding on to the coat tails of the hard-handed gentleman in front, and keeping himself in a position to escape any sudden turn that the game may make upon its pursuers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The little man, in the present case, is the chief instigator of the sport, but he does not love hunting well enough to take direct hold of a tiger's tail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>He keeps at a respectful distance from that infuriated animal, except on such occasions as Peace Commissions, when he is a model of courtesy and politeness, and invokes the blessings of Heaven upon the whole tiger family, and sends his love to any of their friends and relatives who may chance to have heard of him in former times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The parties then resume their former attitudes; the hunted animal in front, tall man hold of the tail again, and little man in the rear, pushing the tall fellow on, and looking out for himself as usual. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> <placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, by virtue of his office, occupies a more prominent position in the antipathies of the <rs>Confederate</rs> people than any other individual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>But it is only as such that he is entitled to that distinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Personally, he has no such claims to the abhorrence of Southern minds as <persName n="Seward,,William,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="default:Seward,William,H.,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>, who, more than any other individual in the <rs>North</rs>, is responsible for the state of public sentiment which brought on the war; for the political organization of abolitionism; for the adoption of coercion, and, we doubt not, for every important step that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Robert,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> has taken, from the time when, on his way to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> to be inaugurated, he refused to disclose the policy of his Administration, down to the conclusion of the <orgName n="Peace Commission" type="commission">peace commission</orgName> at <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> When <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> was engaged in the effort to put down the rebellion in <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName>, she had no more hearty sympathizers with her sufferings than the people of <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>This sympathy was not elicited by the justice of her cause, for no <num value="1">one</num> in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> pretended to believe that she had any lawful claim to the allegiance of a single native of <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>It was simply compassion for those miseries of humanity which followed in the train of the <name>Sepoy</name> revolt, and admiration of the courage and constancy of a hand-full of <name>English</name> soldiers in deadly conflict with innumerable foes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Everybody in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, for that reason, and that alone, rejoiced when the war was terminated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> It is hard to believe, and yet we fear it is true, that the <rs>Government</rs> of that same country looks with aversion and apprehension at the termination of a war in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, which, in its accumulated and long-continued horrors, has had few parallels in history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>There seems to be really a dread among the commercial and manufacturing classes of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> that the <rs>Confederacy</rs> is on the point of succumbing; not because they care a <sic>groat</sic> for the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, but for certain injurious effects that Peace may bring to their own interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The Government of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> shares, beyond question, the same ideas, and holds itself aloof from the conflict to allow both belligerents to exhaust themselves, and furnish corner-stones of the ruins for <name>British</name> aggrandizement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Out of the blood and agony of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> expects to coin her fortune and revive her youth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>To Arm and Equip an Additional force of cavalry, there is need of Carbines, Revolvers, Pistols, Saddles and other accoutrements of mounted men. Arms and equipments of the kind desired are believed to be held by citizens in sufficient numbers to supply our wants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>Many keep them as trophies, and some with the expectation of using them in their own defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>But it should be remembered that arms are now required for use, and that they cannot be made so effectual for the defence of the country in any way as in the hands of organized troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>They are needed to enable our cavalry to cope with the well-armed and equipped cavalry of the enemy, not only in the <rs n="General Service" type="misc">general service</rs>, but in resisting those predatory expeditions which have inflicted so much loss upon the people of the interior. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>A fair compensation will, therefore, be made to all who deliver such arms and equipments to any ordnance officer, officer commanding at a post, officers and agents of the <rs>Quartermaster</rs> and Commissary Departments at any station, or officers in the enrolling service, or connected with the <rs type="place">Nitre and Mining Bureau</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>A reasonable allowance for their expenses and trouble will be made to such patriotic citizens as will collect and deliver to any of the officers above designated such arms and equipments as they may find in the hands of persons not in service, or who will report the same to those officers.
