<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>When the present war broke out he started back to <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Arriving at <placeName reg="Saint Joseph, Buchanan, Missouri" key="tgn,7014443">St. Joseph, Missouri</placeName>, he was unable to get farther; he volunteered in the <rs>Northern</rs> army, expecting to be sent to <placeName reg="Fort Smith, Sebastian, Arkansas" key="tgn,7013924">Fort Smith, Arkansas</placeName>, and intending to desert from that place and make his way to <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>He was attached to the <orgName type="regiment" key="2MORegiment">2d Missouri regiment</orgName>, <persName n="Martin,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00033" reg="mostcommon:Martin,John,,,:1"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Martin</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>Instead of going to <placeName key="tgn,7013924" n="1.000 80" reg="fort smith, sebastian, arkansas">Fort Smith</placeName>, this regiment was ordered, via <placeName reg="Columbus, Franklyn, Ohio" key="tgn,7013645">Columbus, Ohio</placeName>, to <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>, and formed part of the command of <persName n="Rosecrans,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/> He says he was in the battle of <placeName reg="Carnafax Ferry">Carnafax Ferry</placeName>, or Ganley Cliffs, as it is called by the <rs>Federals</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>I questioned him particularly about this engagement and its results to the <rs>Lincoln</rs> army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>He said many placed it at <num value="2200">twenty-two hundred</num>, but the common estimate was the former number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>I interrogate him <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> times on this point, and he was distinct and emphatic in making the above statement. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/> I then inquired how many were wounded?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>He said the number was very large &mdash; that from that point back to <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, a distance of <measure n="30miles" type="distance">thirty miles</measure>, every house along the road was filled with the wounded, people being turned out of doors to make room for them. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>If I remember, the <hi rend="italics">Dispatch</hi> at <num value="1">one</num> time expressed an opinion that the <rs>Federal</rs> loss in that battle was vastly greater than reported and commonly believed to be.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>Their aggregate losses during the war are figured up at <measure n="4825" type="killed">4,825 killed</measure> in battle, and <measure n="7614" type="wounded">7,614 wounded</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>Referring to him, he said, <q>&#x0022;I would like to be under that man. I would be willing to fight under him as long as the war lasts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/> It is natural enough that a people contending against an army <num value="3">three</num> times their number, and having a vast exchequer and enormous military means and appliances at command, should manifest some solicitude for the cooperation of those nations whose interests are equally involved with our own in the success of Southern independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>In the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Revolution, there was not only a universal desire among a struggling people for foreign aid, but distinguished agents were sent abroad and large same appropriated for the purpose of enabling them to operate upon the public opinion of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and enlist the sympathies, and if possible, the assistance, of these Governments in behalf of our cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>It is known that much good was accomplished in this manner, and that <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, in particular, did assist us secretly long before she became our acknowledged and most valuable ally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>It is, therefore, no proof, as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> pretend, of the inability of a people to maintain their own rights, that they should be anxious to secure foreign assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>The <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Revolution would have been successful if <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> had never interfered, and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, notwithstanding their numerical superiority, have shown even more solicitude to secure friends in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> than the people of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>Having no navy, and with our ports Blockaded, we may naturally enough desire foreign intervention to relieve us from this disadvantage, and that is all we have ever asked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>We never expected <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> to fight our battles on land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>If we had needed or desired help of that kind, <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, the great military power of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, was the empire whose and we should have at once sought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>But the world must see by this time that we can fight our own battles, and all we require is an opportunity of commercial communication with the rest of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>But even that is not absolutely indispensable, and there are some respects in which it would be even injuries as. We are now learning to manufacture for ourselves, and to diversify our own industry; but, with a speedy opening of the ports, we should become dependent for all the articles which we need, and which we ought to make ourselves, upon foreign aid. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/> The South is a world in itself; it can dispense with the cultivation of cotton, and raise more than enough provisions of every kind for its own supply; it can clothe itself; it can become independent in every sense of other nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>Whilst, then, we have little doubt that <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> will be compelled in the end to intervene, we see no necessity for despondency and discouragement if the blockade is not raised for a year to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>Still less should we permit our convictions as to the ultimate result of the present struggle to be in any degree affected by the contingency of a <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> alliance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>We have always maintained that the recognition of our independence abroad depends upon our own demonstration of our ability to maintain it by our own arms, and that independence achieved by our unaided exertions will be infinitely more valuable than that which is the result of <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> interference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>Independence gained in that way would only be dependence upon the power by whose assistance it is gained; we should be taunted continually by the <rs>North</rs> with the fact that we were unable to cope with her without the aid of a foreign ally; and, unless we were so lost to national dignity as to throw ourselves at once under a protectorate of the power by whom we were assisted, which would be equivalent to becoming again a <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> province, we should only exist hereafter by the sufferance and mercy of the <rs>North</rs>, and fall a prey at last to her jealousy and revenge. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/> There is no royal road to greatness, either among individuals or nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>It is a law of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, as well as of Nature, that which lasts long grows slowly, and often painfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>No really groat character was ever formed among men, except by long years of discipline and trial, and no nation drops full armed from the womb of destiny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>We must learn to endure, as well as to conquer, to suffer, as well as triumph before we shall ever know ourselves how to appreciate the boon of National independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>Thus far, we have had more reasons for encouragement than despondency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>Thus far, we have demonstrated our ability to defend ourselves, beyond what any <num value="1">one</num> had dreamed of, whether in the <rs>South</rs>, the <rs>North</rs>, or in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>Thus far, we have had evidence of an alliance with the <rs>Southern</rs> cause in the manifest benediction of that <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> which is the <q>&#x0022;only Giver of all Victory,&#x0022;</q> and which can <q> &#x0022;abate the pride, assuage the malice, and confounds the services&#x0022;</q> of the strongest adversary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>From the beginning of the war to the present hour, there has been a series of Providential interpositions in our behalf, which ought to cheer and animate the most despondent with the assurance of ultimate triumph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>Without recognition from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, without the aid of a foreign gun, we have achieved all the great victories of this war, and prevented the enemy, in a whole year of invasion, from advancing <num value="1">one</num> foot into loyal Southern territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>Let us look to the past as a guarantee of the future, let us look to Heaven, and to our own strong arms and devoted hearts, and we shall not only triumph, but our triumph will be permanent and glorious. </p> </div3>

<p> The orders at <measure n="75cents" type="currency">seventy five cents</measure>, or which you allude, it is true, (we are sorry to say,) are being filled very slowly; but this is owing to the demands on us of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>, which for <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> have been beyond our ability to supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>That they have been delayed for any other cause, (except in <num value="2">two</num> instances, where we exchanged salt, at <measure n="75cents" type="currency">seventy-five cents</measure>, for <rs n="pig iron" type="product">pig iron</rs>, to make into salt Kettles, which we were compelled to have and could not purchase with money,) we deny most emphatically.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>We let wagons that come here have a very little, where we are satisfied it is not for speculation &mdash; say, <num value="7">seven</num> bushels to a <num value="2">two</num> horse wagon &mdash; and require them to wait a day or <num value="2">two</num> for that in order that we may ship the more to these <measure n="75cents" type="currency">seventy-five cents</measure> orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>The Government takes from <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> to <num value="3">three</num>-<num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> of what we are making, the balance goes upon orders according to priority of date.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>These orders we did not seek, and in many cases, advised the parties to keep their money; and where we had the slightest cause to believe that a party wished to buy for speculation, we refused to sell him any. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/> We have asked no <num value="1">one</num> more than <measure n="75cents" type="currency">75 cents</measure> per bushel, while we have been offered <measure n="2dollars" type="currency">$2</measure> in gold per bushel and refused it. A gentleman in your city offered a few weeks ago to take <num value="100000">100,000</num> bushels of us, in instalments of <num value="10000">10,000</num> bushels per month, at <measure n="1dollars" type="currency">$1</measure>, <num value="50">50</num> per bushel, which we likewise refused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>The small amount of salt which we have sold in <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName>, through <persName n="McDaniel,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00382" reg="mostcommon:McDaniel,nomatch:0"><surname>McDaniel</surname></persName> &#x0026; <persName n="Irby,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00383" reg="mostcommon:Irby,nomatch:0"><surname>Irby</surname></persName>, and in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, through Sports &#x0026; <persName n="Harvey,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00384" reg="mostcommon:Harvey,nomatch:0"><surname>Harvey</surname></persName>, at <measure n="350dollars" type="currency">$3,50</measure> to <measure n="4dollars" type="currency">$4</measure> per sack, (they being our sole agents in those places,) may have netted us a few cents over <measure n="75cents" type="currency">75 cents</measure>; but, we think, if any, not more than enough to cover risk. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/> If any man can bring a particle of proof going to show that we have realized, or attempted to realized, more than <measure n="75cents" type="currency">75 cents</measure> per bushed for salt, we call on him now to bring it forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>It any gentleman holding our receipt for money thinks as capable of the conduct which your editorial seems to impute to us, we think he ought to withdraw his money. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/> We will now very cheerfully return him, or any <num value="1">one</num> else holding our receipt for money paid for salt, the amount deposited with us. And to show you, <persName n="Editors,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00385" reg="mostcommon:Editors,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Editors</surname></persName>, that we are not desiring to put these orders off, to get better prices, we think it sufficient to refer you to our contract proposed to the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName>, and referred to in your columns some days since.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>These parties holding-our receipts have no doubt incurred heavy losses by not receiving their salt sooner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>All they have now to do, in order to be fully indemnities in damages from us, is to make good before a jury of the country the charge made or insinuated in your editorial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>We challenge investigation now or hereafter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>We have not said these things in a boastful spirit but simply to repel the unjust, accumulation against us before referred. </p>
