<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> Of all the mean, low, lying, dirty sheets published in New York, the <hi rend="italics">Times </hi> is, beyond all comparison, the merest, the lowest, the dirtiest, and the most mendacious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The war in which we are engaged, and into which we have been forced by the pertinacious determination of the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> party to rule us as their <unclear>sub</unclear> has given a new impulse to its lying propensities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>It has infamies to smooth over and defeats to conceal or extenuate, and it stickles at nothing to effect its object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>There they stand, a warning to all mankind of the fearful depths to which a cowardly and degenerate race can descend, when they no longer feel the strong arm of the world's opinion supporting them over the abyss of infamy, but are left by a righteous doom to follow the prompting of their own hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Its allusions to head shavings and half-hangings in the <rs>Southern States</rs> have ceased to have any effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Volunteers cannot be brought to the enlisting point by all the fabrications he can either make on the spot, or all he can revive from the limbo of long-forgotten lies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>In the meanwhile, the tenderness and consideration with which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisoners &mdash; coming here to burn, plunder and ravish &mdash; have been treated, gives the lie to all that the devilish malice of a <num value="1000">thousand</num> <q>&#x0022;little villainies&#x0022;</q> can invent.--When he tells us that <q>&#x0022;we&#x0022; </q> (the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>) <q>&#x0022;are at war with these people,&#x0022;</q> the <rs>Confederates</rs>, and that <q>&#x0022;it is all of their own ordering,&#x0022;</q> the falsehood perpetrated is too glaring to admit of discussion; and when he says that the cause of the war was a mere attempt on the part of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abe,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName></hi> to feed a body of starving men, whom the <rs>Confederates</rs> were seeking to murder, as if it were not the same thing to relieve a beleaguered garrison and to fire on the besiegers, our only feeling is unutterable contempt for the understanding of the brutalized mob who read his paper. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/> It is strange that a man knows less of the appearance of his own face than he does of that of other men, and a good deal less of his own failings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>Such virtues as he possesses he is not apt to be ignorant of; it is possible be may even over-estimate them; but <q>&#x0022;the mystery of iniquity&#x0022;</q> in his heart is a thing which he knows nothing of, or, if he suspects, which he ignores as much as possible, and endeavors not to believe in. It is in vain that the records of Inspiration and the teachings of the <rs type="place">Church</rs> proclaim that man is very far gone from original righteousness; it is in vain that twice every Sunday the preacher reiterates with solemn emphasis the story of man's guilt, requiring a Divine sacrifice to stone for it, and deserving, if unforgiven, eternal woes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>The people depart, and do not believe a word of it, or, in the graphic language of Holy Writ, are like the man who hath seen his face in a glass and departed and straightway forgeteth what manner of man he was. And as with individuals, so with nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>A nation, like an individual, is as blind to its own infirmities as it is to the virtues of other nations, and as sharp-sighted to its own merits as it is to their faults.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>Among all the nations of the earth, none has been more self complacent and pharisaic than the late <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>We were accustomed to consider cursolves the purest, the wisest, the most humane of all nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>On every <dateStruct value="-07-4"><day reg="4">Fourth</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> we assembled to make proclamation to the <name>Universe</name> of the superlative virtue of our ancestors and ourselves, and even our preachers, who, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, denounced us individuality as the chief of sinners, declared on every <dateStruct value="-07-4"><day reg="4">Fourth</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> that collectively, we were the most intelligent and virtuous of human beings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>Whilst there was no part of the country which was troubled with an excess of humility, <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> distanced every other section of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in its sublime self laudation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>It extolled its <persName n="Fathers,,Pilgrim,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00082" reg="default:Fathers,Pilgrim,,,"><foreName>Pilgrim</foreName> <surname>Fathers</surname></persName> as only <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> to the <name>Apostles</name>, and its sons as worthy of such fathers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>It declared that freedom of religion, and civil and political liberty, had found their last and an impregnable refuge upon their rock-bound shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>It never ceased to point out the contrast between the intelligence and the humanity of New Englanders and the ignorance and brutality of the <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> masses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>It absolutely conceived that the very countenances of its people were more intelligent and humane than those of beef-eating <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs>, pock-marked <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irishmen</rs>, and stolid <rs n="German" type="group">Germans</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>It boasted eternally of its various benevolent societies for the relief of suffering humanity, in which large sums were subscribed for various philanthropic objects, and the names of the contributors conspicuously published in the newspapers, so as not to let the left hand know what the right hand death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>They were especially excited upon the subject of <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> bondage, and shewed the most earnest desire to atone for the slave-catching of their fathers, by setting at liberty the objects of their cupidity, without regard to the consequences to themselves or anybody else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>They were so compassionate to human misery, that for years they have been endeavoring to mitigate the severity of the criminal code, and have succeeded in some of their States in abolishing the death penalty of murder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>They had even exhibited a considerable degree of activity in endeavoring to procure the passage of laws preventing cruelty to animals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>The angelic tenderness and sympathy of their natures welled out in a flood of crystal tears over the soul subduing stories of the saintly <persName n="Stowe,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00083" reg="mostcommon:Stowe,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Stowe</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>We were astounded that men could be thrust into dungeons without trial; that they could sometimes be even put to death by the soldiery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>We looked down upon a region which had never known <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus,</hi> nor trial by jury, nor free speech, as comfortable travellers would look from the top of the <rs type="place">Blue Ridge</rs> upon the cabins of the railroad laborers in the valley below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>In the pride of our self-complacency, we attributed these unutterable horrors to the peculiar character of the <rs>French</rs>, whom we had been taught to believe were the <q>&#x0022;half monkey, half tiger,&#x0022;</q> they have been described by <num value="1">one</num> of their own writers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>It was our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> visit to that magnificent building, and our impression before entering was, that had it been originally erected for the benevolent purposes to which it is now devoted, instead of for an Alms-House, the architect could not have been more successful in his design, nor could the city have been more generous or humane in the noble liberality of which it stands so proud a monument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>The courteous Surgeons at the door kindly passed us through, and while our reverend friend was engaged on his errand of mercy, we strolled promiscuously through the different wards, and conversed freely with those we found to be most seriously wounded. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>For <num value="3">three</num> successive mornings in the early part of the week, the poor fellow watched the visit of the physician as the announcement that he must prepare to submit to amputation.

Poor fellow; he was in an ecstasy of delight.
