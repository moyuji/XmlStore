<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>His predecessor, <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Lyons</foreName></persName>, has been literally talked to death by <persName n="Seward,,W.,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="expanded:Seward,William,H.,,"><foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>, in the interminable diplomatic correspondence of the last <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>.--The English Government has selected in his place a stalwart Scot, who may be a descendant, for aught we know, of the royal hero of Bannockburn, and who has just emerged unscathed from a protracted campaign of wordy war with the long winded diplomatists of <placeName key="tgn,1000111" n="1.000 120" reg="zhonghua">China</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>We look with breathless interest to the encounter that is now about to begin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The <rs n="Scotch" type="political">Scotch</rs> are an athletic and pertinacious people; high-cheeked, raw-boned, capable of immense endurance; but unless <persName><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Frederick</foreName></persName> has a tongue that combines the flexibility of an elephant's trunk and the iron sheathing of a monitor, we expect to see him, in less than <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>, in the condition of the <rs n="Frenchman" type="propernoun">Frenchman</rs> in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> who engaged in a trial of talking powers with an <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> competitor &mdash; stone dead, and <persName n="Seward,,William,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="default:Seward,William,H.,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName> whispering in his ear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>He is said to have been very fond of disputation, and, at the same time, very overbearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>When arguments failed, he had recourse to kicking the shins of his opponents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>He <num value="1">one</num> day asked <num value="1">one</num> of his suite why he did not venture to express an opinion on the subject that was being discussed. &#x0022;Sire, it is impossible,&#x0022; was the reply, &#x0022;to express an opinion in the presence of a sovereign who has such strong convictions, and who wears such thick boots.&#x0022; That kind of diplomacy, however, would not suit <persName n="Russell,Lord,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="default:Russell,John,,,"><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName>, who dare not, for his life, employ any other weapon with <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> than words, and the servility of whose house, with some illustrious exceptions, drew from a great <name>English</name> orator the scornful sneer against a former representative of the family: &#x0022;It is little to be doubted that several of his forefathers, in a long series, have <hi rend="italics">degenerated</hi> into honor and virtue.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> is a nation of facts, and not of words, its parliamentary speeches and diplomatic correspondence being always condensed and to the point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>We do not say this in disparagement of <name>British</name> taste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>We are willing to take the advice of <persName n="Burke,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Burke,nomatch:0"><surname>Burke</surname></persName> when he said, &#x0022;Because half a dozen grasshoppers under a fence make the field ring with their importunate chink, whilst <num value="1000">thousand</num> of great cattle reposing under the <rs>British</rs> oak chew the cud and are silent, pray do not imagine that those who make the noise are the only inhabitants of the field.&#x0022; We imagine no such thing; but the fate of <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Lyons</foreName></persName> bears witness that a British Minister, condemned for <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> to engage in a competition of words with the voluble representative of the most loquacious people on the face of the earth, has but little chance of surviving the experiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>In <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, where the people are looked to for the energies that are to work out political changes, the influence of talking or writing is not likely to be underrated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>We have heard of an <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> who, in a railroad car, about <placeName><distance reg="500miles">five hundred miles</distance> <offset>south</offset> of  <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName></placeName>, commenced a description of a fight he had witnessed between <num value="2">two</num> men, and had just got <num value="1">one</num> of the combatants down when the train arrived at the <rs type="place">Petersburg bridge</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The Prime Minister of such a constituency could scarcely be expected to do justice to a fight between <num value="1000000">millions</num> of men in <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>; and <persName n="Bruce,Sir,Frederick,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="default:Bruce,Frederick,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Frederick</foreName> <surname>Bruce</surname></persName> will have to hear the interminable sequel of that story, and discuss, as best he can, the innumerable, points of interest to his Government to which it will give rise. &#x0022;<foreign lang="lat"> <hi rend="italics">Veni, Vidi, Vici,</hi></foreign>&#x0022; is not the <rs>Seward</rs> style of correspondence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> It must be a source of intense gratification to <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> that the <rs>British Minister</rs> has broken down in an effort to keep pace with the verbosity and endurance of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> champion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>In both speed and bottom, the great and glorious Republic defies all rivalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>If they cannot kill the <rs>King</rs>'s English in <num value="1">one</num> way, they can in another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>If the &#x0022;moral effect&#x0022; of that state of things did not paralyze the spirits of our ancestors, we must be degenerate descendants to be unnerved by anything that has now taken place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>It is true that profound gloom prevailed for a time, but it did not last long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>As a narrator of those events has observed, &#x0022;the height of jow and the depth of woe passed like <num value="2">two</num> contending genii over the land during the summer of <dateStruct value="1780--"><year reg="1780">1780</year></dateStruct>.&#x0022; The clouds began to disperse when the interposition of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, sent by <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> to rescue an oppressed nation in its death struggle, electrified the popular heart; and the military operations of <persName n="Greene,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Greene,nomatch:0"><surname>Greene</surname></persName> in the <rs>South</rs> demonstrated &mdash; not the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time in history &mdash; that <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> does not always give the battle to the strong, but can save by many or by few. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/> There is every inducement for the <rs>Confederate</rs> people to show a firm countenance, and a determination to hold out, at least during this campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>In the first place, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are themselves as tired of the war as we are. But for the unfortunate withdrawal of <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,Joseph,E.,,:1"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName> last summer, and the consequent defeat of <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName>, which led to the invasion of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> and the dispersion of his army, and the invasion of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> by <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>; but for that <num value="1">one</num> error, the cry for peace at the <rs>North</rs> would have been stronger than it ever has been here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Indeed, it had already commenced, under the influence of <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="mostcommon:Lee,R.,E.,,:1"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s victories over <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, and the unparalleled slaughter by which they were attended, when that unfortunate affair occurred, and changed at once the whole current of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> mind.--Intent upon peace on any terms a moment ago, it changed with success, and now nothing less than subjugation would do. That was because subjugation was now believed to be easy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>The war is thought there to be almost at an end. They are told so by their newspapers every day, who, at the same time, fail not to represent our affairs in a condition which it requires but little effort, on their part, to render desperate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>Let them be convinced that it is not so, and we shall soon see the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> mind veer around to peace once more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>That was the fear of everybody, and expressed in all companies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>It was so dreadful because it implied a continuance of war, and they are sick of it to death. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/> Another reason why we should continue the war is, that a year cannot pass without a collision between <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> and Yankeedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>All signs indicate the approaching conflict in a manner which it is impossible to mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>It will be through no love of us, or care for our welfare, that <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> will undertake this war; but there can be no reason whatever why we should not extract all the advantage we can out of her act. A powerful fleet and army from abroad, operating against the coasts which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> actually own, or claim, must be powerfully in our favor; and, as long as this is certain to happen, it were folly in us to lose the opportunity it will present by submitting too hastily. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/> But the most powerful motive of all is to be found in the terms which the enemy offer us. Nothing less than absolute submission will answer their terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>We must lay down our arms, disband our armies, and submit to such <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> terms as they choose to prescribe.--What those terms will be, we are not left to conjecture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>They have already passed a law abolishing slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>They have already passed a law confiscating the entire territory covered by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>They have already declared that the <name>States</name> shall, in future, be entitled to no rights greater than those possessed by the counties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>They have, in a word, inaugurated for our benefit <num value="1">one</num> of the most stupendous systems of centralized despotism the world ever beheld, and it is to be inaugurated with the proper accompaniments of a <orgName n="General Confiscation" type="misc">general confiscation</orgName> and an universal spoliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>A Confederate is to own nothing that he can call his own. He is to be judged by <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> judges and tried by <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> juries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>He is to be the slave of his own negroes and of their <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> associates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Such a let is offered him as even <persName n="Katherine,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00031" reg="mostcommon:Katherine,nomatch:0"><surname>Katherine</surname></persName> or <persName n="Nicholas,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00032" reg="mostcommon:Nicholas,nomatch:0"><surname>Nicholas</surname></persName> never thought of entailing upon the <name>Poles</name>, and such as makes that of the <orgName n="Irish people" type="newspaper">Irish people</orgName> blessed in the comparison.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/> An enterprising menagerie proprietor, in New York, has just published an interesting history of all the famous elephants who have exhibited in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>The names of the animals will bring up a great many pleasant recollections of those days when &#x0022;going to the circus&#x0022; was an event to be remembered; when a gentleman in a suit of tights and spangles was an object of the warmest admiration; and when the man who controlled the huge elephant of the procession was looked upon with as much interest as a corps commander is now. We make the following extracts from the showman's account: </p> 
<div4 type="entry" n="1">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/> The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> elephant ever brought to this country was a female called <persName><foreName>Betsey</foreName></persName>, familiarly known to the public as &#x0022;Old Bet.&#x0022; She was shot near <placeName reg="Alfred, York, Maine" key="tgn,7013270">Alfred, in Maine</placeName>, while traveling, by some rustic ruffians, out of sheer wantonness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>In the latter case, some of the parties concerned in the outrage were discovered, and made to pay dearly for their amusement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>Old <unclear>Rom </unclear> was <num value="1">one</num> of the largest elephants ever brought to this country, and was of a different breed from any other that has been here, his tusks being but a few inches in length.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>He was an animal of fine appearance, and very well trained, and well known throughout the country.
