<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>He desired the withdrawal of the resolutions, and advocated the adoption of a series offered by himself, early in the session.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>He maintained that they covered the whole subject wherein the people of his section demanded a change in the organic law, and he utterly repudiated the idea that the question had been introduced here to distract the counsels of the <rs>Convention</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>It had been his belief that the matters pertaining to Federal Relations would have been settled before this time, and he read a series of propositions which he designed to offer, if an opportunity occurred, as a substitute for the report of the <rs>Committee</rs>, embracing a variety of amendments to the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>, as a condition of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>'s remaining in the <rs>Union</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> After a humorous allusion to the hopelessness of a cause which required members to occupy <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> in an exposition of their views, and the prevailing epidemic for speaking, (to which he attributed the delay of action,) he went on to show that the backwardness of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> in the scale of improvement and population, was owing to the working of the <rs>Federal</rs> system, and not to the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The <rs>North</rs> had grown up under a system of commerce and manufactures, protected and encouraged by the legislation of the <rs>General Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Its whole history shows that it has looked to Northern protection, and to that alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>After giving a narrative of the origin and growth of manufactures in the <rs>North</rs>, he said that the <rs>Government</rs>, while we were endeavoring to adjust the <rs>National</rs> difficulties, instead of giving us the olive branch, had given us the <name>Morrill</name> tariff, the worst tariff that had ever been imposed upon a people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>He contended that the <rs>North</rs> were not only protected in their manufactures, but in their agricultural productions, by furnishing a home market for everything the farmer could supply. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> He went on to show the effect of the vassalage of the <rs>South</rs> upon her own industry, by relating facts in his own experience as a sugar planter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>All the profits of Southern planters, or, at all events, a great proportion thereof, went into the pockets of Northern manufacturers; for they raised nothing except the leading staples, and depended upon the <rs>North</rs> for all their supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>He believed that if we had free trade instead of a protective tariff, the profits of the planters would have been sufficient to make the <rs>South</rs> a wealthy community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>It would be impossible, he conceived, for the <rs>South</rs> to overtake the <rs>North</rs>, and thus the question arose, what must we do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>He thought that the <rs>South</rs>, in making her demands, ought to require a free trade, instead of which the <rs>North</rs> had given us a Morrill tariff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>He loved every section of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, and would say to the members from the <rs>West</rs>, that he was willing to concede all they asked, rather than that <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> should be divided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The great question at issue between them would have to be settled by compromise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>He would take a middle ground, and send an ultimatum to the <rs>North</rs>; if rejected, say to them <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> will go out of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>This was the compromise which he favored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>He thought if secessionists would come to this ground, conservatives might also come to it. He hoped all sides would come to such a conclusion at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The people would still have to act upon it, and he rejoiced that it was so. The proposed <orgName n="Border State Conference" type="conference">Border State Conference</orgName>, he thought, would do not good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The people sent us here to act for <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, and not for the <rs>Border States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>He would not consent to put the rights and honor of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> into other hands than <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Let the <rs>Convention</rs> adopt this ultimatum; let it be sent to the people, for them to say whether, if rejected by the <rs>North</rs>, the <rs>Convention</rs> shall be authorized to take the <rs>State</rs> out of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>A vote could be speedily taken, and then the <rs>Convention</rs> could act, and act as a unity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> He did not think the <rs>North</rs> would accept the ultimatum, and then the question came up, where should <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> go?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>He repudiated the idea of a Middle Confederacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The place of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> would be with the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The amendments reported by the committee were good so far as they went.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>He was not prepared to say that he would accept them; for, like his friend from <persName><roleName n="Princess">Princess</roleName> <foreName>Anne</foreName></persName>, he did not think they went far enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>He was, however, in favor of compromise, and hoped that something would be adopted upon which the whole <rs>South</rs> would be willing to stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>He then went on to reply to the argument of the gentleman from <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName> in regard to protection and free trade. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> The advantages of a separation from the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> were next pointed out. Under the system of legislation that prevailed, it would be impossible for <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> to become what the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of Nature designed she should become.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>In the event of a resumption of her sovereign powers, and a union with the <rs>Cotton States</rs>, he believed <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> would become the <rs>Manchester</rs> of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>He looked with no pleasure to the disintegration of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>He had always loved the <rs>Union</rs>, but this was not the time when our affections should have full control of our action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>It concerned him to reflect upon the great names and great deeds of the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>It saddened his memory; but he would rather see <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> annihilated than to see her live degraded; to see her become </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> The fixed figure for the time of scorn, </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> To point his slow and moving finger at. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> He thought he could see that in the <rs>Southern</rs> flag which would do what the present flag would not do &mdash; protect the rights and honor of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The gentleman had also held him up as an exceedingly bellicose character-- </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>The conceded ability of the orator prevents any comments on the manner of disposing of his theme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>He said that his excuse for appearing on the political forum would exonerate him in the eyes of Southern auditors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>He stated and vindicated the views of those who held secession to be our only remedy for intolerable grievances.--He held that it was a conservative remedy for our wrongs, rendered expedient by the unfriendly tendencies of our Northern allies, their assumption of power, and a radical difference in sentiment, which rendered harmony and brotherly union impossible.--By secession, the now determined foes of our domestic institutions would be converted into conservative allies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>It was our right to cut our Northern brethren adrift from the conceit that they had any hand in the regulation of our domestic concerns.--It was the direst resort of revolution, to make our <num value="4000000">four millions</num> of negroes the equals of the white man. The means by which the <rs>North</rs> sought to accomplish it were not feasible.--The end which they would accomplish would ruin us &mdash; the means revolutionize us. The right of secession was inherent to sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>By secession we sustain our legal rights, and maintain, the local authority, which is their guaranty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>Secession appertained to us, a community of sovereigns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>It was a legal remedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>When it was accomplished the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> will have, in a preeminent degree, all the elements of greatness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>The monopolies of the <rs>North</rs> were artificial &mdash; they did not raise all their people needed &mdash; their exclusive privileges were perishable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>The secession of the <rs>Southern States</rs> would produce only temporary inconvenience to our people &mdash; no fundamental change could occur without this result, we had all the elements of unbounded prosperity &mdash; a chance of getting their best men, besides more territory.--A contrast favorable to Southern advantages was presented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>A &#x0022;Border Confederacy&#x0022; was deprecated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>There was no conflict of interest between the <name>Border</name> and Cotton States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>The slave trade had been prohibited by the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>The Southern States could harmonize together.--The Creator had made the negro inferior to the white man &mdash; he had made a place and created him to fill it. At the <rs>South</rs>, white men were on an equality with each other; not so at the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>When an inferior race comes in contact with a superior race, there are only <num value="3">three</num> solutions of the problem of government: amalgamation, extermination, or subordination &mdash; all of which had found an illustration in this continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>In our country, <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> extermination has been the rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>With the negroes, subordination is the policy,--and admirably has it worked for all concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>This relation the <rs>North</rs> seeks to overthrow; but by all that is dear to us, we are resolved that it shall not be done, and that we will neither kill nor marry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>There was no earthly probability that the status would be destroyed.--Society at the <rs>North</rs> would terminate in anarchy or monarchy &mdash; it was tending to agrarianism now. The people of the <rs>North</rs> were becoming foreignized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>At the <rs>South</rs> it is different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>We have a fair proportion of <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs>, <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> and <persName n="French,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00293" reg="mostcommon:French,nomatch:0"><surname>French</surname></persName>, and they are among our best citizens, and fully understand this view of the question, and do not wish our naturalization laws changed any more than we do.--The prospect of obtaining our rights by guarantees or concessions, was small.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>Union men now looked upon it as hopeless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>Each recurring day strengthened fanaticism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>The sentiment against us was powerful &mdash; we could not hope to overcome it. There was not going to be any fighting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>The South was ready, but the <rs>North</rs> was loath to engage in an undertaking that promised such unfavorable results in money and glory. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/> In advocating the duty of secession, incumbent on the representatives of the <rs>State</rs>, he earnestly appealed to <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginians</rs> to rally at once to the side of their brethren of the <rs>South</rs>, and assist them in laying the foundations of an empire which held out such unexampled promise of prosperity and happiness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>The Southern people are your children &mdash; your descendants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/> --The fire-engine is not only a great convenience, but its moral influence, also, is not to be despised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>When the old-fashioned hand-engines were in use an alarm of fire was the signal for excitement, noise, and confusion, and sometimes when popular opposing engines were brought together, the members engaged in angry altercation, and occasionally disgraceful fights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>This arose sometimes &mdash; in fact, most generally &mdash; because all the loafers in the city, like Micawber, who were waiting for something to turn up, at the instant of the alarm would immediately spring forth, like tigers after their prey, to &#x0022;run with the masheen.&#x0022; On such occasions, if an available position was taken away by <num value="1">one</num> engine from another, a disturbance would be sure to take place, and bloody noses and black eyes would sometimes result as a natural sequence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>Under the operation of the paid department, so much contemned at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, when a fire breaks out the noisy crowd of <hi rend="italics">opposition</hi> firemen have nothing to do with it.--The paid &#x0022;boys&#x0022; mind their own affairs, without calling for help from those so fond of running with &#x0022;the masheen.&#x0022; Every thing moves along smoothly and quietly, and all because there is a set of men actuated by a single purpose, in which the feeling of jealous rivalry does not mingle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>All honor to the <rs n="steam fire engines" type="product">steam fire engines</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>They are better preachers of &#x0022;the word&#x0022; than <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of those that stand in the pulpit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>What the city loses by paying for a special <orgName n="Fire Department" type="department">Fire Department</orgName>, with a steam fire-engine, the result has proved they will make up in good order and morality, gained by their use. The great riots in New York, <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, and other cities, have been caused, either directly or indirectly, by the loafers and &#x0022;fast boys&#x0022; who congregate at fires, and learn their manners while running with the machine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>Without disparagement to the former system in operation here, we can say, with truth, that the city has need to congratulate itself on the successful working of its paid <orgName n="Fire Department" type="department">Fire Department</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/> It must certainly have become apparent to the dullest comprehension, that the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, has proved an utter failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>It derived all the vigor it ever had from <num value="2">two</num> sources alone, to wit : from the local support of the <name>States</name> and sections, and from the system of revenue which enabled it to levy immense contributions upon the people, in a manner imperceptible to the popular senses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>A Government, however in trinsically weak, could always manifest an imposing front and an apparent vigor, while enjoying a revenue of <num value="60000000">sixty millions</num> of dollars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>So also could a Government, however feeble and frail in its organization, deport itself with the dignity of imperial majesty, and the authority of imperial power, while sustained by the loyal devotion of <num value="30">thirty</num> sovereign States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>But the moment <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of these States began to distrust and oppose the <rs>Government</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, that moment did it lose <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of its vitality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>Nothing was then required to complete its paralysis, but the loss of its revenues; and these have been lost irrevocably.-- Not only would the secession of the exporting States of the <rs>Union</rs>, which furnished the staples of foreign commerce, have gradually overthrown a system of Federal revenues founded exclusively on impost duties, but, as if to hasten this result, and render its occurrence doubly sure, the <rs>Congress</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> enacted a bill raising the duties to the highest protective point, and thus has driven the import trade of the country into the <rs>Southern</rs> ports, where it is allowed to enter under a very low revenue tariff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>Such is the condition in which we find the <rs>Federal Government</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>With the good will of half the <name>States</name> lost, actually abandoned and defied by <num value="7">seven</num> of them, and fallen into the hands of imbeciles, simpletons and fanatics, it presents a melancholy spectacle of feebleness, dilapidation, and decay. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/> On the other hand, we see a new Confederacy springing up at the <rs>South</rs>, strong in the very elements the loss of which has destroyed the elder <num value="1">one</num>; strong in the loyal devotion of the people and States which are its constituents; strong in the unlimited resources of revenue and credit which it has at command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>The sinews of vigor and power being lost to the old Government, it has nothing left but the forms of a defective Constitution to exert in its last struggles for existence, and the very exercise of these formal powers tends to hasten and complete its ruin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>The new Government, on the other hand, feels that the putting forth its physical powers would vastly strengthen its popularity and bring the affairs of its rival to a crisis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>Its new Constitution, moreover, gives it infinitely the advantage of its adversary, amended, renewed and invigorated, as that instrument is, expressly to obviate the very defects which have sapped the foundations of the old structure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>The difference between the <num value="2">two</num> Governments is the difference between <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct>; between the infirmity and decrepitude of age, and the growing power and buoyant vitality of youth. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>But when it is plain that the losses and material injury would result from adhering to her present hateful association, and that the highest pecuniary and commercial advantages would follow from her forming a proper, natural, and congenial alliance with the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, her delay to take the step seems as inexplicable as it is injurious to her fortunes and her fame. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>They were restrained from voting for secession from the natural aversion felt by all conservative communities to sudden and radical political change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>The great mass of voters naturally shrank from the horrors of civil war, then thought to be the necessary attendant of secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>The secession movement, moreover, was then in chaos, and had not yet developed itself, as it has done since, in a regularly and peacefully organized Government, amply provided with arms, and surrounded with the full equipments of complete political organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>Never before, in the history of the world, did a Government spring so suddenly into existence, and possess itself with the means of independence, at so little cost of blood, and of public debt and treasure, as did that of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>It has demonstrated to the doubting and fearing Border States that secession is not a thing of wars and death struggles, but is a mere affair of pen, ink, and paper.-- Government on this continent is founded alone upon the consent of the governed, and is habitually treated as a necessary evil, from which the governed may withdraw whenever the evil counterbalances the good attending it, and whenever a change of government promises a diminution of the necessary evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>It would be contrary to the genius of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> politics to hold unwilling States by force to an obnoxious alliance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/><placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, therefore, has but to <hi rend="italics">will</hi> her separation from the <rs>North</rs>, and the separation is accomplished, without the firing of a gun or the cost of a dollar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>It is a mere matter of taste and choice, and not a matter of physical ability and power, with a raw head and bloody bones in the way, to frighten her from her propriety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>It is a mere question of the ballot-box, the mere casting of a vote, in which the opposing candidates are the <rs>North</rs>, advocating a system of politics which she has spent her lifetime in opposing, and the <rs>South</rs>, who have established a system of polities for which she has spent a lifetime in contending.
