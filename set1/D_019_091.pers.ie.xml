<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>Before its operations had been disturbed by the fiendish spirit of Abolitionism, the <rs>Government</rs>, such as it was, had engrossed the affections of the people; had commanded the cordial and unanimous support of the <name>States</name>; had harmonized and blended the sections; had conducted the great affairs of the country with beneficent and glorious success; had sowed broadcast, with profusion unexampled, the seeds of power, greatness, prosperity and progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>It was a Government planted in the consent of the people, and flourishing like a green bay tree in their exuberant affections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>No experiment was needed to test its existence; its presence was felt by the people, as the genial atmosphere of a still, sunny day in Spring; not as the chilling blasts of winter, or as the fierce wind in the destructive energy of hurricane and storm. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>It is in no new work that that section is engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>With small beginnings they commenced the same experiment <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> ago.

They persisted in it, in season and out of season; cautiously at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, boldly afterwards; cunningly and persistently always.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>They have at length abused the functions of the <rs>Government</rs> to the extent of alienating from it the support of an entire section of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>To that extent have they proved its capacities for self-destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>That much they did under constitutional forms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>They now, forgetting that it was a Government by consent, and that to make it a Government of force is to change its fundamental nature, and having nothing left to do &mdash; are determined to force the alienated section back into its dominion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>Of course, they must repudiate in so doing the forms of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and resort to mere usurpations of power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>They may, by some most improbable chance, succeed in whipping the <rs>South</rs> into subjection, and in proving, to their own satisfaction, that they have a Government; but by the time the bloody work is all done, the <rs>Government</rs> will have totally changed its nature and become a scourge to the conquerors as well as the conquered. </p> </div3>
