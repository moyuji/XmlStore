<head>Object of the war.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/> According to <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Harpers Weekly" type="magazine">Harper's Weekly</orgName>,</hi> the object of the war is to prove that Northern men are not cowards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>We have too much abhorrence of the blended hypocrisy and silliness which sets up such a pretext to argue it gravely.--We have long ago, and on many occasions, expressed our belief that the <rs>North</rs>, as well as every other nation, is composed in the main of brave men. Animal courage is the rule among mankind, and cowardice is an exceptional misfortune which is confined to no country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>Having said thus much, however, we may also add our conviction that the <rs>North</rs> is not as military a people as the <rs>South</rs>; that the opinions and customs of that section do not encourage that aptitude for arms, and that warlike temper, which in the <rs>South</rs> are universal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>The <rs>North</rs> are a commercial and manufacturing people, and, without disparagement to their courage, that, and not arms, is their <hi rend="italics">forts.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/> Instead of this war being waged to demonstrate Northern courage, (to secure the <rs>Northern</rs> hold of Southern trade, is its real object,) it looks much more like an attempt to demonstrate Southern cowardice.--The imputations upon Southern courage have been just as common in Northern newspapers as those upon Northern courage in Southern newspapers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>The <rs type="place">Harper's Ferry</rs> capture has become a stereotyped theme of sarcasm through the whole <rs>North</rs> at the <rs>Southern</rs> people, who, they declare and verily believe, are a gasconading and pot-valiant race, <num value="1">one</num> of whose towns can be taken by <num value="18">eighteen</num> men and who will fly at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> blast of a trumpet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>Their assurance of this fact, and their idea that the <rs>South</rs> is unprepared to meet them, have a good deal to do with the readiness of many of them to march Southward.--The big stories they tell of immense private subscriptions to the <rs>Government</rs>, and forces as numerous as the armies of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Xerxes,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00128" reg="mostcommon:Xerxes,nomatch:0"><surname>Xerxes</surname></persName>,</hi> are all parts of the same plan, as is also the circumstantial relation of the oath taken by their street rowdies on their knees at public hotels to cut off Southern men's heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>They must believe that we are dastards to the core, or the most hopeless fools on the face of the earth, to be terrified by such absurdities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>The object of all this is plainly intimidation &mdash; not to demonstrate Northern courage, but Southern cowardice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>But, beyond military policy, we freely acquit <hi rend="italics">him</hi> of any expectation of operating on the fears of the land in which he was born.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>He knows <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> too well not to know that, brave as he is, there is no man in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> who is not his equal in courage, and his superior in gratitude and fidelity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/> We shall not condescend to vindicate Southern courage against the libels of its assailants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>The time is near when that will be vindicated in the only unanswerable manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>The ferocious threats of butchering a whole people,--of giving no quarter to prisoners,--of exterminating men, women and children, might have some extenuation if they came from those who have been wantonly invaded and who are fighting in self-defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>But coming from those who perpetrate these enormous wrongs, we have no words to express our indignation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>The annals of civilized mankind might be searched in vain for equal wickedness and ferocity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>They can have no other effect than to fire even the weakest heart, and nerve the arms of even women and children not only to defend our soil, but to visit upon these demons in human form the thorough retribution that their crimes demand. </p> </div3>
