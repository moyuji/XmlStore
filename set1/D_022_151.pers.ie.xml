<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>but despite every conjecture nothing whatever occurred of <unclear></unclear> importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Sharp skirmishing is of daily occurrence on our extreme left, but the results have not yet been fully developed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Several wounded in these affairs have arrived in the city and report the enemy unwontedly pugnactous in that direction, although from every indication, we are ted to believe that their increasing appetite for slanghter will be more than fully satisfied are many hours shall have passed over us. A few prisoners were brought into our Lines yesterday and <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>, and from their reports it would seem that no preparations are yet perfected by the <rs>Federals</rs> for any <q> &#x0022;onward to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>&#x0022;</q> movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>It is possible <persName n="Libby,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Libby,nomatch:0"><surname>Libby</surname></persName>'s warehouse will soon be honored by the arrival of a few <num value="100">hundred</num> of the blue-coated gentry, and their greeting be far otherwise than as conquerors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>From the interior of the enemy's lines we learn from recent arrivals that the depredations of the foe have been frequent, their bearing remarkably imperious and overbearing &mdash; violent hands being laid upon every species of property, while aged inbabitants are daily subjected to harsh language and ill manners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Since <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>'s visit to their rear the rancor and ill-breeding of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s hirelings have been more than usually oppressive, their threats and taunts are increasing as to blackguardism, while the unprotected have no resort but patience and silent endurance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Indeed. Federal cavalry have been particularly active in and around <placeName reg="Charles City, Charles City, Virginia" key="tgn,2111055">Charles City</placeName>, we hear; squads are patrolling all the country in search of rebels and the disloyal; but up to the present their anxiety and industry have been of no avail, for the mounted rebols have thus far cleverly cluded all traps and search. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The movement of troops has been constant, but with what intent and purpose we have no positive idea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The men are in splendid order &mdash; all is enthusiasm, animation, preparation and impatience &mdash; there is an oppressive sense of incertitude, however-imaginings of bye-gone tardiness to be again rehearsed perhaps &mdash; yet all with <num value="1">one</num> accord yearn for action, and are willing to trust the issue to sinewy arms and valiant hearts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> An ominous slience reigus supreme-pickets in the timbor move thoughtfully to and fro without firing an accustomed shot; artillerists lean upon their guns and scan the landscape, indifferent to the seene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>All is repose &mdash; the fields are moist and green, camp fires glisten and glow in the evening air, and the sun goes down upon the quietest day that we have ever seen at the <rs type="place">Lines</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The enemy are reported to have been extremely busy in their inhospitable swamp for several nights past, pickets imagine the noise to have arisen from the movements of divisions &#x0026;c. Whenever the conflict shall begin, however, the sequel will demonstrate that the enemy have devised every means known to ingenuity, cunning, and malice to cause destruction among our columns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>They will not trust as heretofore, in numbers, nor will they advance upon the open field and try the guage of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>All will be left to trape, batteries, felled timber, and obstructed roads, and failing in these, panic will be universal among them, and the slaughter unprecedented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Something must be done to put a stop to such lawless proceedings; for according to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> idea, a guerrilla band lurks behind every bush and in every patch of woodland.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>A more effectual scare has not been given since the war began.
