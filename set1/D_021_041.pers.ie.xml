<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Then, I learn from those who were present, a scene transpired that words cannot describe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>It was, he said, simply a temporary military measure adopted to aid the blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>It would be the duty of the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to remove all these obstructions as soon as the <rs>Union</rs> was restored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>It was well understood that this was an obligation incumbent on the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>At the end of the war with <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> that Government had been called upon to remove a vessel which had been sunk in the harbor of <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, and had recognized the obligation and removed the vessel accordingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>Moreover, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> were now engaged in a civil war with the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>He was not prepared to say that, as an operation in war, it was unjustifiable to destroy permanently the harbors of the enemy; but nothing of the kind had been done on the present occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>The same measure had been adopted by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in order to make the blockade complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>There is a further ground for holding the plaintiff within the real disability to sue in our courts, which is intended to be arserted by this answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>There should be no question that the endeavors to enforce commercial rights &mdash; the attempts to collect the avails of prior commercial transactions &mdash; come completely within the spirit of this restriction, and that under a proper construction of this act it is unlawful to allow a citizen of that rebellious State (especially <num value="1">one</num> alleged to be himself in hostility to the <rs>Government</rs>) to enforce any such remedy in our courts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>Nothing can arise out of this conflict of a nature to shake confidence in the future. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/> Free from foreign cares, I have directed my attention more especially to the state of our finances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>A candid statement (<hi rend="italics">expose sincere</hi>) has placed the real state of affairs before you. I shall only say a few words on the subject.--The public expressed astonishment (<unclear></unclear>) at the sum of <num value="963000">963,000</num>,000f. to which the floating debt has risen; but that debt, if it be henceforth checked, need give no cause for anxiety, for it had already attained that figure before <dateStruct value="1848--"><year reg="1848">1848</year></dateStruct>--a period when the revenues of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> were far from approaching what they are at the present moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>Moreover, let <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> be deducted from this amount the <num value="652000">652,000</num>,000f. which weighed upon the <rs>State</rs> at a period anterior to the empire; then the <num value="78">78</num>; <num value="600">600</num>,000f. repaid to the restes holders (<hi rend="italics">rentiers</hi>) at the time of the conversion; then the <num value="283000">283,000</num>,000f. and unsecured, caused in the last <num value="2">two</num> budgets by distant expeditions, and which it might have been possible to secure by a loan. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/> It will be seen that, since the establishment of the empire &mdash; thanks, it is true, to the consolidations successively operated &mdash; the deficits (<hi rend="italics">decouverts</hi>) have not increased in proportion to the wants for which it was necessary to provide, and to the advantages obtained during the last <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure>. In fact, gentlemen, it would not be just to forget the increase of expenses caused by the annual interest of the loans contracted for <num value="2">two</num> wars which have not been devoid of glory, the &#x00A3;<num value="622000000">622,000,000</num> employed by the treasury in great works of public unity, independently of the <num value="3">three</num> milliard appropriated by companies in the completion of <num value="6553">6,553</num> kilometres of railways; the establishment of the network of telegraphic communication; the improvement of the condition of nearly all the servants of the <rs>State</rs>; the improvement of the soldier's welfare; the <hi rend="italics">cuares</hi> of the army placed on a footing in keeping with the exigencies of peace, the dignity of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>; the transformation of the fleet and of all our <hi rend="italics">metoric</hi> for the artillery; the restoration of our callings for public worship, and of our public monuments. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/> All these outlays have given a beneficial impulse to public labor throughout the empire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>Have we not seen cities re-embellished, companies enriched by the progress of agriculture, and our foreign commerce increase from <num value="2">two</num> milliards <num value="600000000">six hundred millions</num> to <num value="5">five</num> milliards <num value="800000000">eight hundred millions</num>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>In short, by the sole increase of public prosperity the resources of the <rs>State</rs> have increased by many hundreds of <num value="1000000">millions</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/> This numeration shows us the full extent of the financial resources of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>; and yet, whatever may have been the origin of the deficits &mdash; however legitimate may have been the expense.--It was prudent not to increase them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>With this object in view I have proposed a radical means to the <name>Senate</name>, which confers upon the legislative body a higher control, and associates it closer with my policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>But this measure was not, a may easily be supposed, an expedient to lighten my responsibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>It was a spontaneous and serious reform, of a nature to force us to be economical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>In renouncing the right to open supplementary and extraordinary credits in the interval between the sessions, it was nevertheless essential to reserve the power of providing for unforeseen necessities. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>The system of transfers provides the means, and it has the advantage of limiting that power (<hi rend="italics">faculle</hi>) to really urgent and indispensable wants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>The strict application of this new system will assist us in placing our financial system on the soundest basin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>I count upon your patriot sin and intelligence to <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> my efforts by your willing uppered. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>The Budget will be presented to you immediately on the opening of the session.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>It is not without regret that I have decided to propose to you a re-adjustment of certain taxes, but by the progress of our revenue I am convinced the increased burden of taxation will only be temporary. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/> You will <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> have to turn your attention to the project of law relative to the conversion of the <num value="4">four</num>-and-a-half per cents, the object of which is, by equitably conciliating the interests of the <name>Treasury</name> and those of its creditors, to prepare the consolidation of the debt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/> Gentlemen, I have frankly stated to you the actual position of affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>You are aware that whenever an opportunity of a useful reform has presented itself I have resolutely taken advantage of it. I shall not, nevertheless, maintain less intact the fundamental bases of the constitution which has already acquired for the country <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> of order and prosperity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>I am aware that it is the fate of all men in power to see their nest intentions misrepresented, and their most praiseworthy acts distorted by party spirit; but those who raise this outcry are powerless when the confidence of the nation is possessed, and when nothing has been neglected to deserve it. This sentiment, which displays itself on every occasion, is my most precious reward, and is my greatest strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>Should unforeseen events occur, such as the dearness of provisions and scarcity of labor, the people may suffer, but in their justice they will not hold me responsible for their sufferings, because they are aware that all my thoughts, all my efforts, all my acts incessantly tend to improve their condition and increase the prosperity of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/> Let us not delude ourselves as to what we still have to accomplish, but at the same time let us congratulate ourselves at having traversed <num value="10">ten</num> ears amid the quiet of satisfied populations and the union of the great bodies of the <rs>State</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/> The invasion which the <rs>South</rs> has most to fear is that which will cecur as soon as peece is made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>This is a subject eminently worthy the attention of Congress and of the <rs>State Legislatures</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>We confess that on this point our apprehansions are great, and that we sometimes fear that, after hostilities have ceased the <rs>South</rs> will come again as completely under the commercial domination of the <rs>North</rs> as it ever was before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>It is unnecessary to say that, in this event, the <rs>Union</rs> will have ceased to exist only in name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>It would still be a Union of the powerful and the weak, of the independent and the dependent, leaving the <rs>South</rs> as completely at the mercy of the <rs>North</rs> as she ever was under the former Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>If the <rs>North</rs>, after this war, is still to conduct our commerce, trade, and manufactures, we shall always to week, less and less capable of selfdefenes, and the question of our nominal, as well as actual subjection, be only a question of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>We have heard the prediction from <num value="1">one</num> of the most <unclear>nagactions</unclear> and dispassionate observers of men and things in the <rs>South</rs>, that, as soon as peace is declared, a whole legion of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> commercial and manufecturing agents will appear in every Southern city, town and neighborhood, each of them with an enormous pile of documents under his arm proving that he had nothing whatever to do with the present war; that he had been persented and maltreated on account of his strong Southern sympathies, and respectfully requesting <q>&#x0022;a share of Southern patronage.&#x0022;</q> Men whose hands have not fire to Southern houses, demolished Southern property, and are redwith Southern blood, will be here by <num value="1000">thousands</num> and tens of <num value="1000">thousands</num>, smiling, smirking, bowing, cringing, fawning, protesting, and proving by documentary evidence that they had always opposed the war, and inwardly gicating over the felly and credulity they can be so easily imposed upon by the smooth congue of flattery and deceli. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/> The people of the <rs>South</rs> are natursily shocked at the idea that atter the stupendon, crimes and herrors of a war whose unparalleled barbarities have called down the solemn reprobation of every civilized country in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, we should ever permit ourselves again to become hewers of word and drawers of water for these maliguant and murderous tyrants &mdash; It would be <unclear></unclear> far better, to be subjugated in name as well as in fact, than to be guided by the hunbug of independence, and become real and <unclear> tary</unclear> slaves to a hideous despotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>In the <num value="1">one</num> case, cur vassalage will not be our degradation, because we shall have resisted it with all the courage, power, and islents the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of Heaven has praced at our disposal, and we shall throw it off at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> opportunity, and <unclear></unclear> our wrongs to posterny for redress and retribution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>We have become convinced of the necessity of some legislative action to check the growth of the evil complained of, only by an examination of the startling facts recently developed in connection therewith, some of which lave already been laid before our readers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>A highly respectable citizen of <persName n="Floyd,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00436" reg="mostcommon:Floyd,nomatch:0"><surname>Floyd</surname></persName> writes that the committee appointed by the <rs>Court</rs> of that county to supply the families of volunteers, are even now unable to procure grain for the purpose; yet the smoke of more than <num value="50">fifty</num> distilleries blackens the horison, while the wall of the indigent mother and helpless infant goes up for <q>&#x0022;bread.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/> This, we are assured, is not alone the case in <placeName reg="Floyd, Kentucky, United States" key="tgn,2000789">Floyd county</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>That there will be violent opposition to the measure has already been indicated; but if members lack courage to come up to the work like men, and fail to ensot the law, the responsibility, a <num value="1000">thousand</num> times more fearful than that which they now shrink from will be upon their own heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>If we neglect all the warnings of the past and the present, and make no provision for an inevitable and obvious future; if, either from a bigoted attachment to the rules controlling trade in ordinary times or a seckling to neighborhood sentiment, our legislators exclude from their minds the most practical and imperative elements of safety; if they fail to use their power for the real benefit of the <num value="1000">thousands</num> through a hope to futher some miserable personal aims; then assuredly their sin will be as great as that of the disulters themselves, and their punishment as certain as that of the unsuspecting victims of an inordinate appetite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>Whatever other qualities he may possess, if he want personal integrity, truthfulness and benevolence, and, in fact, the elements of the <rs>Christian</rs> character, he cannot be a statesman in the nighest sense, nor a safe ruler.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/> I have before stated that some of the private soldiers, from the upper rooms, were employed in the officers' quarters, a service which they gladly accepted as affording superior rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>Among these was Corporal a &mdash; a of New York, a young man of wealthy pacentage, of attractive manners, good interlectual endowments and with as <q>&#x0022;handsome as <persName n="Apollo,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00522" reg="mostcommon:Apollo,nomatch:0"><surname>Apollo</surname></persName>.&#x0022;</q> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>While thus passing through <num value="1">one</num> of the main thoroughface, M &mdash; I was a costed by a little girl, who presenced him with <unclear></unclear> at the same time pointing to a young lady on the other side of the street as the donor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>The Corporal acknowledged the <unclear></unclear> a polite bow, and proceeded upon his mission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>The lady, apparently fascinated, followed him at distance to his prison, and as he entered it she reciprocated his bow and leisurely walked away. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/> For some inexplicable cause the <rs>Corporal</rs> was not again permitted to go out, and a negro &mdash; I should have mentioned that quite a number of servants were in prison &mdash; was dispatched in his stead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/>The negro had not proceeded far when he was met by the young lady referred to and the sequel to the interview was developed in a package with which be returned to the officers' quarters, and delivered to Corporate.--It was found to contain a new suit of clothes, and upon <num value="1">one</num> garment was pluned a small card, nearly <unclear></unclear> with the name of his benefactress. </p> 
<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head>&#x0022;Only this and nothing more.&#x0022;</head>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/> <rs type="role">Corp.</rs> M &mdash; I <unclear></unclear> addressed himself to the <unclear></unclear> of <unclear></unclear> composition, in which he gracefully acknowledged his receipt of the gift, and expressed his heartfelt thanks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>This was delivered by the negro on the <sic>the</sic> day following, and he returned with a package containing a number of <rs n="pocket handkerchiefs" type="product">pocket handkerchiefs</rs>, socks, and shirts! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="868"/> As in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instance the only communication which accompanied the gift was the donol's card.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="869"/>The corporal again acknowledged his coligatrous by a police note, which was duty delivered through the same medium. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="870"/> Thenceforth the <rs>Corporal</rs> was in daily receipt of the choicest dainties, and a regular epistolary correspondence was carried on until the day of his release, which occurred on the <date value="01-03">3d of January.</date> A <unclear></unclear> engagement had been made during the interval, with the understanding that the parties would meet in <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> on the <date value="03-01">1st of March</date> next. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="871"/> I have omitted to state that the <rs>Corporal</rs> had been sent back to his old quarters, but having ascertained that his <hi rend="italics">fair tha norata</hi> daily promenaded with a view of the officers' quarters, he obtained employment as a cook, and was thereafter unfailingly at his post to reciprocate the loving smiles of his borothed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="872"/> She had sent him her daguerrotype, which he frequently exhibited to me. It was a lovely image, and <num value="1">one</num> that would have required <unclear></unclear> to carry captive the most frigid and lethargic fancy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/>I learned that she was of a wealthy family, and of as good blood as was to be found among the S. F. <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Va.</placeName>, and her letters, I was assured, evinced that she was no less intelligent and <unclear></unclear> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/>The intelligence was quickly conveyed to his yearning admirer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/>We saw nothing of her, however, as we marched through the streets of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, though the <rs>Corporat</rs>'s longing vision was strained at every animate object. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/> But when a hart was ordered, a fine carriage driven by a negro, suddenly made its appearance, and harted at a short.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="878"/>Istance from our ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/>A lady descended &mdash; there was a brief but carbest <unclear></unclear> among the <rs>Confederate</rs> officers of our guard, and the next moment the enraptured twain (Corporal M &mdash; a and his affiance) were face to face: A few words, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> they had ever exchanged, in <unclear></unclear> yet metting <unclear></unclear>; their faces were for a moment gured, as with a flame &mdash; the engagement was stered renewed &mdash; there was a fervent, thrilling pressure of their hands, and they separated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/> A circumstance is connected with the daguerreotype above referred to which deserves a passing notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>Before it left the prison the picture was taken from the case and a small slip of paper, of sely written, and addressed to <persName n="McClelian,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00523" reg="mostcommon:McClelian,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McClelian</surname></persName>, was deposited therein, and the daguerreotype then replaced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>It was safety delivered to the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs>, a meeting of the <rs>Cabinet</rs> was called, and the day following there was a leak stopped a mysterious leak from high official circles, and which had inestimably benefited the rebels for many months. </p> </div4> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
