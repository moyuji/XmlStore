We were kept under fire for some time without being allowed to fire a shot, as our <orgName n="Flying Artillery" type="artillery">flying artillery</orgName> had not taken its position, and it was important that the enemy should be kept in ignorance of the extent and position of our brigade, until the artillery had commenced playing upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>They turned and fled for their lives, throwing down their guns, knapsacks, and everything that would encumber their flight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>We are not of that opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The reserve which so unexpectedly turned the table had undoubtedly been prepared beforehand, as to the part it was to play in the engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>This is quite evident from the general progress of the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>The only object of the <rs>Confederates</rs> was to allure, as it were, the enemy to the most favorable point, and, at an opportune moment, to rush upon him. This will be fully apparent when we consider their prolonged silence, in not returning the fire of the assailants, their gradual retreat, and the continuance of the fight until nightfall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The late hour of the evening when the attack took place, is doubly explained by the intention of finding their adversaries much more exhausted, and of adding to the defeat the confusion of darkness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> We consider, as being equally improbable, that version of the fight which attributes the disaster of the <rs>Federal</rs> army to a motiveless panic, which, beginning with the teamsters and followers of the camp, had spread to the ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Such incidents are not of rare occurrence; but they seldom attain great proportion and are of short duration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>It is more than probable that this cause exerted some refluence upon the extent of the rout; but, under no hypothesis could it have given rise thereto. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> The details which will be read below will show that the proportions of this disaster surpass, by far, under any circumstances, the preceding events of the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>A loss of <num value="2500">2,500</num> or <num value="3000">3,000</num> is conceded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The whole <orgName n="Federal Artillery" type="artillery">Federal artillery</orgName> fell into the hands of the conquerors, and it may possibly be the case with a greater portion of the baggage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The prisoners must also be counted by the <num value="1000">thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>In the a word, not only have <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName> and <placeName reg="Fairfax Court-House">Fairfax Court-House</placeName> fallen into the hands of the <rs>Confederates</rs>, but the routed regiments quivering under the goading of fear, made <num value="1">one</num> straight dash towards the fortifications of <placeName reg="Arlington Heights, Weber, Utah" key="tgn,2137140">Arlington Heights</placeName> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> If <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00033" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> had it in his power to follow up his advantages and making good this immense rout, all the advanced camps must have fallen in his power, and the safety of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> itself would be doubtful.--This has been, moreover, fully appreciated at the seat of Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>All the reinforcements within reach, both in men and guns, were ordered at once to the <rs>Virginia</rs> shore, to stop the progress of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>These new troops, protested by the entrenchments at <placeName reg="Arlington Heights, Weber, Utah" key="tgn,2137140">Arlington Heights</placeName>, will alone be able to face the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>After such a rout, an army cannot be reorganized in <num value="1">one</num> day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/> It would be superfluous and impossible to attempt a description of the consternation produced by this news &mdash; the more dreadful in its effects that it followed without transition the glad tidings of a false victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>With the emotions of the public event, is blended the peculiarly terrible anguish that the soldiers who fell to-day were the citizens of yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/><num value="1000">Thousands</num> of families are thrown into the deepest anguish, awaiting the sad confirmation of the fate of dear ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>The same feelings must have pervaded the entire <rs>North</rs>, and the <rs>South</rs> itself will not drain the cup which victory has filled with blood, without mixing with it the tears of sorrow. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/> The cry of surprise and of public woe re-echo to the voice of recrimination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>The inefficiency of the commanders, and the fatal impatience of the <rs>Cabinet</rs> strategists form the burden of complaint, for by the exertions of these latter was <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00035" reg="mostcommon:Scott,Winfield,,,:2"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName> forced to abandon the dilatory policy which he had adopted &mdash; The Tribune, which has specially contributed in precipitating measures, by its irritating and provoking policy, was, for a time, the object of the menaces of an excited populace. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/> These tardy reproaches will not remedy the evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>The fruits of the bloody lesson of the <num value="21" type="ordinal">21st</num> must be sought elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>It may now be conceived to what results civil war will lead us &mdash; and these disasters seem to have been placed on the very threshold by <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, as a warning against further progress. </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/> The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> explosion occurred in a large mortar, suspended from the ceiling, in which there was a quantity of fuse powder, and a large copper ball for crushing the composition when the pot was swung to and fro.

Fortunately, a barrel of powder, and several boxes of cartridges which were in the room, escaped explosion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>The roof of the building was lifted clear from its place, the windows all blown out, and the brick walls cracked in several places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>The workmen in the yard were quickly on the spot, and extinguished the fire before it had made much headway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>The cause of the explosion is not known, but it is supposed that the ball in the mortar became heated by constant motion, so as to ignite the composition. </p> </div3> <milestone unit="column" n="4"/>

<head>The latest line of the programme.<lb/>[from the <orgName n="New York Daily News" type="newspaper">New York Daily News</orgName>.]</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/> The earnestness with which the war journals have gone to work during the last few days to stimulate the anti-slavery feeling, gives conclusive evidence that their object in this war is abolition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>They have concluded that the hour for unmasking has arrived, and we may soon expect to see a negro rampant and shattered fetter lock, <hi rend="italics">noir</hi> on a field of <hi rend="italics">gules,</hi> blazoned to the world as their device.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>It is fortunate for the people that the impatient fanaticism of these experimentalists has thus early got the better of their prudence, or rather of their cunning, for prudence as <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>, its antecedents and its consequents have demonstrated, is not of their vocabulary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>The people will now be able to draw a line distinctly between the <name>Peace</name> party and War party.--Hereafter those who still lay <q>&#x0022;that flattering unction to their souls,&#x0022;</q> that they are fighting for the <rs>Union</rs> and its flag, will be behind the age; they will resemble Doblin on the treadmill, who fancies he is getting along finely on his journey, while he is simply grinding his master's corn. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/> The Abolition journals will not now cease to urge their panacea upon the <rs>North</rs>, until it has been swallowed or emphatically declined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>Like the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> <rs type="role2">Senator</rs> who, devoted to a single object, said only, <foreign lang="spa"><q>&#x0022;Delenda est <placeName key="tgn,7016143" n="1.000 10" reg="Carthage,Wilayat Tunis,Tunis,Africa">Carthago</placeName>&#x0022;</q></foreign> in debate, whatever might be the subject under consideration, we shall have nothing now but the reiteration of <q>&#x0022;Slavery is doomed&#x0022;</q> thrust by these mock philanthropists upon the public car. They have hinged their moral upon their political code so cleverly that the point of separation is undiscernible to their own vision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>It is an undoubted fact that many who heretofore have entertained no thought of Abolitionism have been gradually coaxed, by the sophistries of these arch mischief makers, to seriously regard the application of that detestable doctrine as a necessity in the present strife. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/> Such proselytes are of that class whose sectional jealousy has been inflamed past endurance by the late defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>Without strength of character sufficient to bear with manly fortitude the humiliation of a reverse, they are glad to catch at any suggestion, however sinful or impracticable, that seems to yield a chance of turning the tables upon their victors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>But with the masses of the <rs>North</rs> the experiment will fail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>They will be neither driven nor entrapped into antagonism with justice and their own interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>When once fully convinced of what to the keen observer is a palpable fact, that from the bead of the nation down to the pettiest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>Abolition scribbler, the partisans of Black Republicanism are in league against the <rs>Southern</rs> constitutional privilege, and are prosecuting the war with that ultimate design, the elements that have provided money and men for this Administration will evaporate like dew drops beneath a scorching sun. Let the people know, as they soon will know, that the spirit of Abolitionism stalks in the van of their armies, and the war is at an end. Money chests will be closed and swords will be sheathed with a sudden decisiveness that will leave <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00098" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, like a political <persName n="Selkirk,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00099" reg="mostcommon:Selkirk,nomatch:0"><surname>Selkirk</surname></persName>, sublime in the extremity of his solitude. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/> The <rs>North</rs> cannot be so utterly deficient in perceptive faculty as not to understand at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thought, if not instinctively, that to continue this war in the spirit of a crusade against slavery is to confirm the separation of the sections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>It seems like listening to the ravings of an opium cater, to hear these dreamers talk of rebuilding the fabric of the <rs>Union</rs> with the very instruments that have accomplished its destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>To conceive that <num value="1000000">millions</num> of freemen will live in concord with us after we shall have robbed them of their property to the amount of hundreds of <num value="1000000">millions</num>, is a stretch of the imagination that must have reduced that quality in the conceivers to a condition of dangerous tension.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>Even <persName n="Greeley,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00100" reg="mostcommon:Greeley,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName>'s expansive idealism might be expected to collapse after such a desperate strain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>It reminds <num value="1">one</num> of <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00101" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName>'s couplet: </p> <cit><q> <lg type="stanza"> <l>&#x0022;If to go in. Sir, you go out-- </l><l>The way you take is strangely round about.&#x0022; </l> </lg> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/> If chastisement and subjugation be the only objects of the war, then, indeed, it may be well enough to aim at this tendon <persName n="Achilles,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00102" reg="mostcommon:Achilles,nomatch:0"><surname>Achilles</surname></persName> &mdash; this <q>&#x0022;most vulnerable spot.&#x0022;</q> as the <name>Abolitionists</name> say of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>But chastisement, <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> events have proved, is likely to be a some what costly and dangerous luxury; and as to subjugation, it admits of disputation whether the victors of Big Bethel and <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName> will ever bond very meekly beneath the chariot wheels that are to be sunk into their soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>This Abolition Administration and its creatures know that, in attempting to conquer the <rs>South</rs>, they have assumed an Augean task, for the accomplishment of which they have no <persName n="Hercules,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00103" reg="mostcommon:Hercules,nomatch:0"><surname>Hercules</surname></persName> at their command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>They should know that, although in point of valor we are on an equality with the <rs>South</rs>, yet where it amounts to an invasion of the soil of free-born <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs>, discomfiture will be our portion in the end &mdash; As surely as the <rs>North</rs> strikes <num value="1">one</num> blow at slavery, so surely will that blow recoil upon itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>Shame upon the howling fanatics who insist upon thrusting their poison into the life-blood of the country at such a time as this ! When the last hope of reconciliation shall have vanished, when the dismemberment of the <rs>Union</rs> shall be an accomplished fact, as it will be should Abolition be made a feature of this war, let those who set the hounds upon the scent of slavery remember that the detestable deed was theirs. </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> </div3>
