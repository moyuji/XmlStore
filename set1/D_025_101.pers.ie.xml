<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> We have interesting news from <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>, some account of which you have doubtless received ere this by telegraph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>In this, as in the matter of <persName n="Wheeler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Wheeler,nomatch:0"><surname>Wheeler</surname></persName>'s expedition, however, I can only furnish you with a general account, leaving it to some <num value="1">one</num> who was present to supply the details. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> I learn from a well-informed source that <num value="2">two</num> dispatches have been received by <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName> from our cavalry forces operating on the line of the <orgName n="Eastern Tennessee Railroad" type="railroad">East Tennessee Railroad</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>These forces consist of <num value="2">two</num> brigades, commanded respectively by <persName n="Morrison,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Morrison,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Morrison</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Colorado" key="tgn,7007158">Col.</placeName> <persName n="Dibbrell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Dibbrell,nomatch:0"><surname>Dibbrell</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> dispatch states that they attacked the enemy's cavalry on the <dateStruct value="--21"><day reg="21">21st inst.</day></dateStruct> at <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, about <placeName><distance reg="60miles">sixty miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName></placeName> by the railroad, capturing <measure n="400" type="prisoners">400 prisoners</measure>, their artillery, small arms, camp equipage, &#x0026;c. The <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> dispatch states that the <rs>Confederates</rs> pursued the remainder of the <rs>Federal</rs> forces to their defences at <placeName reg="London, Madison, Ohio" key="tgn,2080432">London</placeName>, some <placeName><distance reg="5miles">five miles</distance> beyond <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName></placeName>; where they made additional captures, amounting altogether at both places to <measure n="700" type="prisoners">seven hundred prisoners</measure>, <num value="50">50</num> wagons, loaded with stores, <num value="10">ten</num> ambulances, <num value="6">six</num> pieces of artillery, a lot of mules and horses, and other property. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> No particulars have been received, as far as I can learn, of the casualties on either side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Nor is it known what the strength of the enemy is, or the character of his defences, at <placeName reg="London, Madison, Ohio" key="tgn,2080432">London</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>This latter place is situated on the <placeName key="tgn,2715022" n="1.000 335" reg="tennessee river, united states, north and central america">Tennessee river</placeName>, where the railroad crosses it, and the forces stationed there constitute, probably, the advance guard of that wing of the <rs>Federal</rs> army which is operating from <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName> as a base.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Our success will doubtless cut off the supplies which it is reported <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="nearbymention:Rosecrans,Sunday,,,"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> has been receiving from that quarter, and to that extent add to the perplexity of his situation at <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> Turning towards <placeName reg="Bridgeport, Cocke, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098103">Bridgeport</placeName>, it is reported that our pickets are <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> this side of <placeName reg="Trenton, Dade, Georgia" key="tgn,2024539">Trenton, in Dade county</placeName>, Gd., and that the enemy's pickets occupy <placeName reg="Sand Mountain, Catoosa, Georgia" key="tgn,2642000">Sand Mountain</placeName>, the foot of which on this side is represented to be <placeName><distance reg="13miles">thirteen miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Bridgeport, Cocke, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098103">Bridgeport</placeName></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>It is by this route, it is believed, that the enemy would advance by the rear upon <placeName reg="Lookout Mountain, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100143">Lookout Mountain</placeName>, the possession of which is an object of the greatest interest to him. It is reported that he is engaged rebuilding the bridge at <placeName reg="Bridgeport, Cocke, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098103">Bridgeport</placeName>; but neither the bridge nor the railroad thence to <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, would be of any avail to him unless he could wrest <placeName reg="Lookout Mountain, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100143">Lookout Mountain</placeName> from us. The <orgName n="Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad" type="railroad">Nashville and Chattanooga railroad</orgName>, as you are aware, runs between the <placeName key="tgn,2715022" n="1.000 335" reg="tennessee river, united states, north and central america">Tennessee river</placeName> and the mountain, which approach so close in many places that it was necessary to blow out a road-bed along the rocky sides of the mountain before the ralls could be laid down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/> The <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> once remarked, in commenting on the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> complaints about the building of the <rs>Alabama</rs> in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> did not furnish the <rs>Confederates</rs> the seamanship and enterprise by which the <rs>Alabama</rs> had been made such a dreadful grievance to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/> That is very true, and it is a source of consolation to us now that we are at all events not dependent upon <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> for the naval energy and heroes qualities which have almost driven the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> flag from the ocean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>There will be no difficulty in getting ships; even in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, according to <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName>'s own statement, ships like the <rs>Alabama</rs> may be built, and we are inclined to think that such ships may be of more value to our cause than the rams, which are, after all, a problem so far as sea-going qualities are concerned, and which might never have come up to the expectations of the people in breaking the blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>But our naval heroes, like <persName n="Semmes,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00194" reg="mostcommon:Semmes,nomatch:0"><surname>Semmes</surname></persName> and <persName n="Maffit,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00195" reg="mostcommon:Maffit,nomatch:0"><surname>Maffit</surname></persName>, are of our own manufacture, and if they cannot burn down New York, <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, they can effectually destroy the commerce from which those cities derive their chief support.

They perform their glorious deeds under disadvantages which are unknown to their brethren of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>They are alone upon the &#x0022;wide, wide sea;&#x0022; they are uncheered by a sight of even the heavens of their native land; they have only at intervals faint echoes of that national applause which falls in full blast upon the ears of our successful soldiers; they never return to walk our streets and see in every eye the admiring flashes which grateful <num value="1000000">millions</num> cast upon their champions and deliverers; they are not encouraged by the physical and moral strength of a vast army of armed men. A few solitary ships, hunted by vast navies, they maintain in foreign seas a warfare that requires not only the loftiest courage, but the most consummate skill, the most sleepless vigilance, and the most perfect self-reliance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>We are proud to believe that we have among our naval officers many more such men &mdash; men who pine for the opportunity of distinction, and who only lack the opportunity to be equally celebrated with <persName n="Semmes,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00198" reg="mostcommon:Semmes,nomatch:0"><surname>Semmes</surname></persName> and <persName n="Maffitt,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00199" reg="mostcommon:Maffitt,nomatch:0"><surname>Maffitt</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>Even in our own limited circle of acquaintances in the navy, we know more than <num value="1">one</num> who, if he had but the chance, would make as great a name for his country and himself as either of these illustrious heroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>For such materials as these we are not dependent upon <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> or any other nation, and if they will only let us have the ships, they may sacrifice the rams, and we will ask them no other favors. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/> --I have the honor to acknowledge your letter of the <dateStruct value="--21"><day reg="21">21st inst.</day></dateStruct>, enclosing a report and resolutions, adopted by the <orgName n="House of Delegates" type="government">House of Delegates</orgName>, on the subject of details by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> Government. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/> I am reluctant to suppose the <orgName n="House of Delegates" type="government">House of Delegates</orgName> contemplated asserting any jurisdiction or right of supervision over the disposition by the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> of the soldiers and conscripts enrolled in its service; yet, to avoid all misconstruction from the broad terms of the report and resolutions, it behooves me, as an officer of that Government, respectfully to remind you that it possesses exclusive control over the whole subject, and to say that my answer is dictated by no recognition of other authority in the matter, but solely by the consideration which I am happy to feel for the opinions of the representatives in <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Houses</rs> of the <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>I have preferred to consider the report and resolutions as evincing only of the deep interest felt by the <orgName n="House of Delegates" type="government">House of Delegates</orgName> in the common cause, and of its desire to afford counsel and assistance in the discovery and removal of hindrances and abuses tending to lessen the strength and efficiency of our armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>Viewed in this light, I accept the report and resolutions with satisfaction, and acknowledge my obligations for the information and suggestions sought to be given by them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>I will not deny they might have been more acceptable had they been couched less in the language of complaint and stricture, but I shall not on that account fail to seek from them the benefits of which they may be susceptible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>In furtherance of that end, I may be pardoned for requesting that the <orgName n="House of Delegates" type="government">House of Delegates</orgName>, in substantiation of the somewhat vague and general charges of the report and resolutions, will require the committee to submit to the <name>Department</name> the proofs before them of the cases of imputed fraud and abuse, with the names of the parties committing or participating in them, on which they have founded their statements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>In my limited experience in the <name>Department</name>, I have too frequently found general charges, when sought to be probed and investigated, unsustained by the facts; but I cannot doubt that adequate evidences were possessed by the committee and the <rs type="place">House</rs> before they embodied in the form of a report and resolutions such grave charges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>When furnished with such evidences, I may be enabled, as I shall be prompt, to investigate and correct the supposed abuses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>I cannot indulge the hope that where so many interests and temptations exist, abuses and excesses to some extent have not prevailed, but I have been ever anxious to guard against and remove them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>It would be tedious to enumerate the orders and measures which have been from time to time adopted by the <name>Department</name> to restrict details to the industrial operations indispensable to the <rs>Government</rs>, and which could not otherwise be carried on. It has been earnestly sought to withdraw as few men as possible from military service in the field, and none when it was not confidently believed they could be more beneficially employed for the common cause in works of production than in arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>The resolutions of the <rs type="place">House</rs> found me engaged in urgent measures to effectuate such restrictions, and I am happy to be assured of the cooperation of the <rs type="place">House</rs> in attaining them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>It is with some surprise, however, as well as satisfaction, that I find myself, by the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> resolution of the <rs type="place">House</rs>, urged to adopt such measures as will in my opinion substitute men over the conscript age and able bodied free negroes, by draft, for details from the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>It has been my earnest wish to do this, and so far as temptations to voluntary engagements could be presented to the classes referred to, they have been liberally offered, but I have not been invested by the <orgName n="State Legislature" type="legislature">Legislature of the State</orgName> with the power of compulsion in the premises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>Whenever any effort of the kind, even under the stress of military necessity, has been essayed, it has been at once met by discontent and remonstrance, which members of your <persName n="House,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00224" reg="mostcommon:House,nomatch:0"><surname>House</surname></persName> have, on some occasions, been the organs to express.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>In the resolution of the <rs type="place">House</rs>, I trust, is to be found a purpose, so far as depends on them, to afford, by appropriate legislation, the command of the resources they recommend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>When so afforded, I shall promptly seek to bring them into efficient use, and manifest my appreciation of the confidence reposed by the <name>Legislature</name> in the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities by a zealous effort to employ the instrumentalities your <persName n="House,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00225" reg="mostcommon:House,nomatch:0"><surname>House</surname></persName> has desired. </p> <closer> <salute>Very respectfully, your ob't serv't,</salute> <lb/> <signed><persName n="Seddon,,James,A.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00226" reg="default:Seddon,James,A.,,"><foreName>James</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName>  <surname>Seddon</surname></persName>,</signed> <lb/> <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>. </closer> </div4>
