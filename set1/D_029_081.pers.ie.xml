<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> From the time when the tolling and patient philosophy of induction and experiment, inaugurated by <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Bacon</foreName></persName>,</hi> came into favor, physics, arts, utility and progress have ruled the thoughts of men, and developed with amazing rapidity their producing powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The barren disputations of the schoolmen and the absurdities of astrology and alchemy receded before the advance of natural science and mechanical construction, and the arrangement and adjustment of natural forces took their place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>If the great master who taught the world to investigate, step by step, and process by process, the laws to govern them in their efforts to subdue matter and combine forces could view the gigantic results of enterprise, production and consumption which distinguish our modern civilization, his soul would swell with a triumph such as never thrilled the heart of the grandest and most successful of military conquerors. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> Now that war has ended and peace resumed its away; now that <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> has entered upon a new era, we feel profoundly solicitous that the mechanical arts and manufactures should enlist the interest and energies of her people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The war itself bore striking testimony to their value and importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The genius of the country was only quickened and invigorated by the excitations of the time, and the creative and constructive forces played a part as influential as the armies in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The development of mechanical skill in the <rs>South</rs> was among the most noticeable phenomena of that wonderful period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>We had been a purely agricultural people; and, in the midst of an age and country of mechanism, had left to others the rich prises of mechanical and manufacturing industry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The war having disclosed to us capacities which we did not know ourselves that we possessed, let us now apply them to the restoration of our fallen fortunes and the development of the wealth and greatness of our State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The influence of the mechanic arts upon political and social progress is conspicuously inscribed upon every page of modern history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>It was among the most powerful agencies that undermined the institution of feudalism and paved the way for the triumph of liberal ideas and the fusion of social classes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The philosophical historian, <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Hallam,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:Hallam,nomatch:0"><surname>Hallam</surname></persName>,</hi> in classifying the periods and the causes of the deliverance of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, has ascribed <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> degrees of progress to the introduction of woolen manufactures into Flauders, nearly <measure n="600years" type="date">six hundred years</measure> ago. This new dispensation of industry made that little district <num value="1">one</num> of the wonders of the world, and attracted to it merchants from all the kingdoms of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Mechanical skill and production spread from <persName n="Flanders,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Flanders,nomatch:0"><surname>Flanders</surname></persName> to the free cities of <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>; and <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>'s great <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><foreName>Edward</foreName></persName></hi> conferred upon her a boon, by introducing emigration from the manufactories of the continent, which has rarely been equalled by her most glorious military and naval victories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>It has been justly observed that, aided by the practical arts, the democratically interest gained the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> modern triumph; for while, in an earlier day, <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Tyler,,Wat,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="default:Tyler,Wat,,,"><foreName>Wat</foreName> <surname>Tyler</surname></persName>'s</hi> powerless rabble fell easily before the knights in their armor of steel, <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,nomatch:0"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName></hi> gathered from the houses of mechanics and merchants those steady soldiers whose backs were never seen by the foe. The progress of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> since she emerged from the middle period exposed her to the taunt of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName></hi> that she was a nation of shop-keepers; but she was, and is, equally a nation of mechanics; and it was the wealth which trade and manufactures produced that proved too strong in the end for even the genius of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>.</hi> It has been said, and we dare say with truth, that <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Arkwright,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Arkwright,nomatch:0"><surname>Arkwright</surname></persName>,</hi> who placed cotton spinning in the sisterhood of national powers, bore the <rs>English</rs> nation triumphantly through the wars of the <rs>French</rs> revolution; and that <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Watt,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Watt,nomatch:0"><surname>Watt</surname></persName>,</hi> who organized the steam engine, was the conqueror of the conqueror of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>At a later period, when a plain <placeName reg="Northumberland, England, United Kingdom" key="tgn,7008165">Northumberland</placeName> mechanic inaugurated the grand railroad experiment of the age, <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Arnold,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Arnold,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Arnold</surname></persName>,</hi> of <placeName key="possibilities=13" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Rugby</placeName>, looking from <num value="1">one</num> of the bridges at the flashing train, exclaimed: <q>&#x0022;<num value="1">1</num> &#x0022;rejoice to see it, and to think that <hi rend="italics">feudality is &#x0022;gone forever.&#x0022;</hi></q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> The development of the mechanic arts in the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> colonies awakened, at an early period, the jealousy of the mother country, and gave rise to a repressive, and, occasionally, prohibitory policy of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, intended to impoverish the industrial resources of the colonists, and drawing from <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Burke,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Burke,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Burke</surname></persName></hi> the remark that the <rs>English</rs> nation seemed to act upon the thought that <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> was becoming her rival in the department of handicraft, This legislation aroused a corresponding spirit in the colonies, so that, as has been justly remarked, when the time came for rupturing the tie of empire, the question of taxation was rather the occasion than the primary cause of the wars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The mechanical genius thus early and prominently displayed in this country has stamped itself indelibly upon the national character and progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Even <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, the workshop of the world, with her <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> <rs n="steam engines" type="product">steam engines</rs>, driven with a power equal to <num value="2000000">two millions</num> of men, trembles at the mechanical energies of a country which, in the very infancy of its existence, has reclaimed an empire larger than <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> from the wilds of barbarism, which has constructed <measure n="30000miles" type="distance">thirty thousand miles</measure> of railroad, and <measure n="25000miles" type="distance">twenty-five thousand miles</measure> of electric wire. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> We invoke <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to embark with promptness and energy in those mechanic arts which are, in these modern days, the chief agencies of national wealth and power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>We have neglected too long, in former days, this patent and practical highway to greatness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The undoubted energies of the <rs>Virginia</rs> character has been unprofitably expended in barren political fields, yielding only the thistle bloom of glory, but nothing that could afford sustenance to either man or beast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>If the mechanical arts, with which manufactures may be considered synonymous, and the enterprises of commerce had engaged as much and as persistently the attention of our people as the prizes and harvests of political renown, she would now be the foremost State of the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName>, We have now an opportunity to retrieve our error and to lay the foundations of the most prosperous and powerful Commonwealth of the <rs>Western Hemisphere</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>We should rejoice to see some movement to that end inaugurated by the <name>Legislature</name> &mdash; the establishment, for example, of an institution similar in design to the late <orgName n="Mechanics Institute" type="institute">Mechanics' Institute of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName></orgName>, but with a more comprehensive plan, and more enlarged capacities of usefulness. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> Nations, as well as individuals, who have seen much of war are very safely disposed to engage in it snow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>It is the greatest of all human calamities, and can only be excused in cases of extreme emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The people of these Southern States have seen it in all its horrors; and had they their choice in future, we are confident that nothing could ever induce them to engage in it again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>It is a calamity, let it result as it may; let it be crowned with victory or marked by defeat. &#x0022;A great victory,&#x0022; said the <rs>Duke</rs> of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Wellington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Wellington,nomatch:0"><surname>Wellington</surname></persName>, </hi> &#x0022;is the most terrible of all calamities except a great defeat.&#x0022; In the same spirit, <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> is said to have expressed the hope that he should never see any more fighting. &#x0022;War is only sweet to those who never tried it,&#x0022; says the old beggar in <persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Scott,Burr,,,:1"><surname>Scott</surname></persName>'s novel of the <name>Antiquary</name>, who had been a soldier during many years of </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> his life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>But to persons of that description it seems to be peculiarly and unnaturally sweet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The people of the <rs>South</rs>, for example, who have experienced all the horrors that war can bring in its train, pray day and night that they may never again be visited by it. The people of the <rs>North</rs>, on the other hand, who have but a very dim perception of what it actually is, seem always ready to plunge into it. We speak of the body of the people, not of the military class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Soldiers are always inclined to peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Civilians are the men who, in <measure n="9cases" type="mass">nine cases</measure> out of <num value="10">ten</num>, bring on war. As soon as it comes they get out of the way and leave the toll and danger to the soldiers, who never have anything to do with producing it, and whose duty is confined to fighting it out. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> The people of the <rs>South</rs>, having had war at their doors for the last <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>, are extremely desirous to pass the rest of their lives in peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>For that reason, without knowing anything further of the relations existing between <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> and this country than what can be gathered from the newspapers, they universally cherish the hope that they may be of such a nature as to permit the continuance of peace without a loss of honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Besides the enormous sacrifice of life entailed upon them by the late war, they are literally ruined in fortune to such an extent that an exception to the general rule can scarcely be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>They wish leisure, to restore their shattered finances and support their beggared families; and they cannot hope for it if we are to have a foreign war so soon after that domestic war which has left them so desolate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Besides all this, there are few families in the <rs>South</rs> who have not lost some of their members in battle, and they all shudder at the chance of losing those that remain in the same way. The voice of the <rs>South</rs>, however, can no longer be heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>or, at least, if heard, it can no longer command attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Unfortunately for us, the voice of that portion of the nation which has the power to order all things according to its will seems to be opposed to the wishes of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>We judge so from the tone of the <rs>Northern</rs> papers and of the preachers who figured on Thanksgiving day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> The difference of tone in the <num value="2">two</num> sections is easily accounted for on the principle we have laid down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>A burnt child dreads the fire; a people who have just been suffering all the horrors of a bloody war cannot be expected to desire its immediate renewal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>At least <num value="1">one</num> generation must pass away, and be replaced by another that shall know nothing of what its predecessor suffered, before the <rs>South</rs> will ever be clamorous for another war. <measure n="6years" type="date">Six years</measure> ago, no doubt, it would have been as eager for it as the <rs>North</rs> appears to be now. But a mighty change has come over the spirit of all its dreams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>However, if the alternative of war or national dishonor be clearly presented, there can, of course, be but <num value="1">one</num> choice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>In our view of the position of the <num value="2">two</num> parties, the issue can hardly be doubted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> are here upon the same continent with <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, whose boundary is conterminous with theirs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>It has just shown its power to send any number of men into that country that may be required to effect the expulsion of the <rs>French</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>They employed a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men in the subjugation of the <rs>South</rs>: they can employ quite as many &mdash; nay, twice as many, if necessary &mdash; in the war with <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/><placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, on the contrary, lies <measure n="3000miles" type="distance">three thousand miles</measure> off, on the eastern side of the <rs>Atlantic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>She must send here all the men on whom she can rely by means of ships.

<head></head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/> it is our purpose to furnish our readers regularly with reports of the state of the <rs type="place">Richmond markets</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>The difficulty of performing this task is by no means inconsiderable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>While there is a good deal of uniformity in the retail prices, the wholesale prices are affected in so great a degree by the large sales held by the extensive auction houses that quotations made by any of them indicate rather the rates at which the goods are offered privately than the sales made by auction; so that, though it may be true of any given article that it is held at a certain price, yet it does not follow that the same article was not sold by auction on the very day the quotation was made for a higher or lower price.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>And, indeed, sales by auction in former times were not taken into the account, for the sufficient reason that they constitute but a small proportion of the entire sales. &#x0022;but we have changed all that.&#x0022; the largest houses in the city &mdash; or, rather, we should say, some of the largest &mdash; have regular sale days, and &#x0022;knock down&#x0022; to the highest bidder immense quantities, not only of such articles as were formerly so disposed of, but of staple goods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>It is true that many of them are like <rs type="color">silver</rs> and <rs type="color">gold</rs> in their purchasing capacity, and always bring just about the <rs type="place">Market</rs> price; yet, as half a cent per pound on sugar, or a cent per pound on coffee, is accounted a good margin for a wholesale dealer's profit, and as this difference between private and <rs n="auction sales" type="product">auction sales</rs> frequently occur, the reporter of the markets will often find that his reports of the markets are supposed by the trade not to be exactly accurate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>Again, dealers from the interior, where competition is not so pressing as to compel them to hesitate long before bidding a cent per pound, or yard, or dozen, frequently give a decidedly upward tendency to such articles as they need by making bids which alarms the retailers in the city and its neighborhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>Of course we cannot report these unusual fluctuations in prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>Our reports will be of prices at which the articles named are sold privately in the regular way of trade; and we shall try to make them reliable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/> <hi rend="smallcaps">the money Market.</hi>--here, as elsewhere, gold has declined since the policy of the <name>Treasury</name> was developed; but that decline has not rendered the money Market any easier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>Whether caused by &#x0022;the supposition that the sub-treasury is supplying a large amount&#x0022; of gold in the open Market, or by any other cause whatsoever, the lower price of gold seems here merely to indicate the higher price of good paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>Those who advocate usury laws would hardly believe us if we should tell them that here in this city, where the law prohibits the taking of more than <num value="0.06">six per cent</num>, as interest, good substantial paper is exchanged for greenbacks less from <num value="2">two</num> to <num value="0.05">five per cent</num>, a month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>The fact is, money is scarce &mdash; very scarce &mdash; and timid people always make it more scarce by unusual and unnecessary precautionary measures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>We are hopeful, and would fain believe that our business men will not be affected by a temporary scarcity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>But a truce to our speculation; we proceed to quote wholesale prices, where not otherwise specified. </p>
