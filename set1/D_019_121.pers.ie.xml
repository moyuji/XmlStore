<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> How many so-called informed men have read the debates in the <rs>Federal Convention</rs> of <dateStruct value="1787--"><year reg="1787">1787</year></dateStruct>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>How many in the enlightened, progressive, intellectual and <persName n="North,,Free-Soil,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="default:North,Free-Soil,,,"><foreName>Free-Soil</foreName> <surname>North</surname></persName> have formed their opinions of the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> upon such reasoning?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>In relation to the question of coercion and force, which the vulgar and coarse-grained Ape of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> is attempting to make a practical <num value="1">one</num>, <q>&#x0022;<persName n="Madison,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Madison,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Madison</surname></persName> [in that Federal Convention] observed that the more he reflected on the use of force, the more he doubted the practicability, the justice and the efficiency of it, when applied to people collectively, and not individually.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>A <orgName n="States Union" type="union">union of the States</orgName> containing such an ingredient seemed to provide for its own destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The use of force against a State would look more like a declaration of war than an infliction of punishment, and would probably be considered by the party attacked as a dissolution of all previous contracts by which it might be bound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>He hoped that such a system would be framed as might render this resource unnecessary, and moved that the clause be postponed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The motion was agreed to, <hi rend="italics">nem con,</hi>&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> But then, the ape who has been elected by the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> vandals, wishes to ascertain <q> &#x0022;whether we have a Government&#x0022;</q>--a National, Consolidated Empire-- himself its head &mdash; such as the <name>Governments</name> of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> or <placeName reg="Rossiya" key="tgn,7002435">Russia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>And in order to this he has waged war not against <num value="1">one</num> State, but several States, assuming the powers of an Autocrat and a Dictator; and, sustained in his purpose by the demoralized sectionalism which has elevated him to the seat once occupied by a Washington and a Jefferson, whose shoes latchet he is unworthy to unloose. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> has proclaimed at the ballot-box that she will never submit to such a trampling upon the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and such a usurpation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>She has now severed herself forever from the unholy alliance, and is now belligerent, ready, as she has ever been, to sacrifice all in the cause of liberty, and the right of a people to choose their own rulers and their own form of Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>But not only has the warning of <persName n="Madison,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Madison,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Madison</surname></persName> been disregarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>He warned the <rs>Convention</rs> against <q>&#x0022;pushing the experiment too far&#x0022;</q>--the experiment of emasculating the <rs>State Governments</rs>, and the formation and establishment of a centralized and consolidated Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/><q>&#x0022;Some people,&#x0022;</q> he said, <q>&#x0022;will support a plan of vigorous Government at every risk.&#x0022;</q> Such are the <rs>Illinois Ape</rs> and his equally apish supporters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/><q>&#x0022;Others of a more Democratic caste,&#x0022;</q> he concluded, <q>&#x0022;will oppose it with equal determination, and a civil war may be produced by the conflict.&#x0022;</q> Such was the prophetic language of <persName n="Gerry,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Gerry,Eldridge,,,"><surname>Gerry</surname></persName>, and such is the war now existing.--But, I must back to the present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>An ignorant and misled man, by the name of <persName n="Ballentine,,Charles,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="default:Ballentine,Charles,,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Ballentine</surname></persName>, came to me yesterday morning and begged intercession for him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>He seemed much grieved &mdash; said he could not read, and had voted a ticket handed him by <num value="1">one</num> in whom he placed confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/><q>&#x0022;Do you think,&#x0022;</q> said he, &#x0022;I would fight against our people &mdash; no sir, never.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/><q>&#x0022;I have been deceived.&#x0022;</q> Perhaps there are other cases among the <num value="75">75</num> of this character. </p>

He was drilling his company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The men were in position to resist a charge &mdash; the front rank kneeling and the rear standing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>He approached to give instruction to <num value="1">one</num> of his men in the front rank, as to the proper position in which he should hold his musket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>In doing so, the bayonet of the man in the rear pierced his eye. At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> the <rs>Captain</rs> felt no inconvenience, regarding it as a slight pricking, and even continued the drill, but, after retiring to his tent, so intense became the pain, that he was brought in the city in a hand-car, and is now at the <rs type="place">Ocean House</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>It is to be hoped the brain was not penetrated, as is feared, and that he will, in due time, recover. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>I observe that the volunteers in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> have been told they will have to wait for their pay until after the meeting of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>I hear that things at the <rs type="place">Navy-Yard</rs> are now in a way to work well, and that in a short time order and efficiency will reign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Progress has so far been made with the <term type="ship">sloop-of-war</term> <rs type="ship">Preble</rs> as to render <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of her port-holes visible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>In a short period she will be raised, and in due time docked. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>He visited the <rs type="place">Navy-Yard</rs>, and will assume the command of the forces here to-morrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>He is a sprightly, active, and energetic looking man, and no doubt will fulfill the public expectations which his reputation as a soldier justly warrants. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>He is a young man, animated by a noble emulation, and bears with him the good wishes of the whole community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>He is a native of this city, and no doubt feels that its honor and reputation are now allied with his own. He will bear himself well wherever his lot may be cast. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> I send you a line from this good old secession county.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Our election passed off very quietly on yesterday, although there was polled in the county a much larger vote than usual, and the people are very deeply interested in the great question of the day. All of the precincts, except <num value="3">three</num> small ones, have been officially heard from and unofficial returns have been received from them, so that the result in the county is pretty well ascertained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>We had no vote in opposition to the <name>Ordinance</name> of Secession &mdash; <persName n="Holliday,,A.,R.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="default:Holliday,A.,R.,,"><foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Holliday</surname></persName> received almost a unanimous vote for the <orgName n="Public Works Board" type="board">Board of Public Works</orgName>--there was a decided majority in favor of <hi rend="italics">ad valorem</hi> taxation, and <persName n="Nelson,Mister,William,T.,B.," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="default:Nelson,William,T.,B.,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName n="William">Wm.</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Nelson</surname></persName> is probably elected to the <orgName n="House of Delegates" type="government">House of Delegates</orgName>, though the official returns from the <num value="3">three</num> precinets yet to be heard from may alter the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/><persName n="Nelson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="nearbymention:Nelson,William,T.,B.,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Nelson</surname></persName> was the only candidate in the field, but many of the friends of <persName n="Ambler,,William,M.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="default:Ambler,William,M.,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Ambler</surname></persName>, <rs type="role">Esq.</rs> unwilling to lose his services from the councils of the <rs>State</rs>, determined to vote for him, notwithstanding he refused to declare himself a candidate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The result is, that in spits of the fact that no polls were opened for him at several of the largest precinets in the county, and he lost many votes at others from his not being a candidate, there was given such a spontaneous expression of the affection of the people for him, that he is defeated by a very small majority-- if, indeed, he is defeated at all. Had it been generally known in the county that he would be voted for, he would have undoubtedly been elected by an overwhelming majority. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> The ladies of the <rs type="place">Court-House</rs> and vicinity have been busily engaged making up uniforms, knapsacks, tents, &#x0026;c., for our volunteers, and the ladies in other parts of the county have been at the same good work.

To suppose that she cares a baubee for the <name>North</name> or <name>South</name>, as such; to fancy that Governments indulge personal loves and hates like individuals, is simply nonsense; to imagine that nations have consciences, and are governed by convictions of right or wrong, is contradictory to all history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>We see what the whole <rs>North</rs> is doing at this moment purely from interest, or what it considers such, and its interests are the only principles which any nation recognizes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/> Certainly, thus far, the tone of her press has wonderfully altered from any it has ever held before.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/> The necessity of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> for the peculiar kind of cotton raised in the <rs>Southern States</rs> is the great fact which will control her policy upon <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>We observe that the only mode of obviating the difficulty suggested in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and confidently maintained in the <rs>Northern States</rs>, is, that cotton will be shipped up the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, and thence by railroad to the seaboard &mdash; an onerous and expensive process at best, but <num value="1">one</num> which the <rs>North</rs> hugs to its bosom with frantic assurance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>Thus, a Northern paper remarks: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/> <q>&#x0022;This year's cotton crop, which will be ready for exportation about the beginning of winter, will be shipped up the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, and thence by railroad to the seaboard, thus transferring to the <rs>North</rs> the principal branch of Southern commerce, and benefitting our great lines of transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>The articles of necessary consumption which the <rs>South</rs> must purchase with the proceeds of the cotton crop, must come to them during the blockade of their ports through the <rs>Northern</rs> cities.--True, the war will diminish their ability as buyers, but the <rs>North</rs> will be benefitted by their trade as far as it goes, whether it be little or much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>Business will readily adapt itself to the new condition of the country, confidence will begin to revive with the termination of suspense and uncertainty, and the industry and trade of the country will be suffcient to give us resources for conducting the war to a successful termination.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/> If the <rs>South</rs> permits <num value="1">one</num> bale of cotton to go Northward, it will deserve subjugation. --But it has not the most remote idea of surrendering an advantage which is more important to it than an army of <num value="0.5">a half</num> <num value="1000000">million</num> of men, and, which in fact, may compel the most powerful empire of modern times to vindicate its independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>The Northern dreamers are reckoning without their host when they suppose the <rs>South</rs> capable of such folly.--They know nothing of the temper of the <rs>Southern</rs> people, who have made up their minds to sacrifice everything on the face of the earth,--cotton, labor and life,--before these scoundrels shall subjugate their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>The <orgName n="Memphis Appeal" type="newspaper">Memphis <hi rend="italics">Appeal</hi></orgName> declares that this whole Northern project of getting cotton by railroad-- </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/> <q>&#x0022;Is just what we have determined at every hazard to circumvent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>Cotton will be raised as usual for foreign markets, but we believe that we only scho the voice of a fixed and irreversible public opinion when we assert that not <num value="1">one</num> solitary bale will be allowed to pass North of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> line, until the <rs>Abe Lincoln</rs> raid, like that of his worthy predecessor, <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00114" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>, shall meet with some other than a &#x0027;successful termination.&#x0027; --The cotton crop for the present year may fall short of the usual amount owing to the extraordinary quantity of provisions, breadstuffs and other army supplies that are being raised throughout the <rs>South</rs>; but those whose conduct brought on the circumstances necessitating this deficit, must endure the privations which it may occasion.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/> The <orgName n="Savannah Republican" type="newspaper">Savannah <hi rend="italics">Republican</hi></orgName> says every bale of cotton, and every cotton- field in bloom, will be burnt before Southern cotton shall leave the <rs>South</rs> except through Southern ports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>This is the true spirit of men who deserve to have a country, and who, we hope in Heaven will make the whole land a desert before it shall pass into the hands of those mercenary cities of the <rs>North</rs> who are seeking our destruction. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/> With such a determination on the part of the <rs>South</rs> made manifest to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, that country will soon throw the weight of her sword in the balance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>Whilst she has everything to gain, she has nothing to lose by such a course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>She is not dependent in any way upon the <rs>North</rs>; the <rs>North</rs> is her commercial and manufacturing rival, whose wings would be clipped forever by an alliance of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> with the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>Moreover, such an alliance would relieve <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> from her galling dependence upon a powerful rival for the supply of an article essential to her own power and prosperity, and which has compelled her, and, as long as the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> remained <num value="1">one</num> people, would continue to compel her, to endure insuits and indignities, simply because she could not afford to resent them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>Never was there such an opportunity as <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> now has, to preserve, promote and perpetuate her manufacturing, commercial and political greatness. </p> </div3> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="868"/>The <q>&#x0022;<num value="10">Ten</num> Jolly Drovers&#x0022;</q> was a gem of a country inn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="869"/>Why, she was a gem of a country landlady, to be sure. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="870"/> I mentioned, when my pen <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> touched this paper, that it was nearly dark when I reached <placeName reg="Deepwater Station">Deepwater Station</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="871"/>A drive of <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> with <persName><foreName>Jim</foreName></persName>, the coachman, had made it still more near, and by the time I entered the red-tiled porch every owl had gone to roost, and lamps were twinkling in the kitchen and the hall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="872"/>Candles had been taken into a room at the right, just beyond the bar, for me, and the sight of a tempting table for a meal, half supper and half tea, made me so hungry that I at once <q>&#x0022;fell to,&#x0022;</q> feasted like a king, and then went to bed and slept without the least incursion of nightmare. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/>The week which I had allotted for my holiday passed rapidly away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/>I congratulated myself on having found this happy valley &mdash; this home where no shadow of care brooded &mdash; these friends whose lives had more of sunshine and less of shadow than any I had ever had before. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/> But <q>&#x0022;call no man happy till he dies,&#x0022;</q> says a wise Eastern proverb; and I rejoin, call no place a paradise till you see its angels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/>For places, like people, have their good and bad attendant spirits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/>I found it so before my sojourn at the <num value="10">Ten</num> Jolly Drovers was over. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="878"/> On the last night of my stay I sat late in my little parlor below stairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/>When I took my candle to go up stairs, the house was shut up. <persName n="Bell,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00437" reg="mostcommon:Bell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Bell</surname></persName> had retired to her bed-room on the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> story, and I could hear my friend <persName><foreName>Jim</foreName></persName> snoring on his settee in the kitchen, where he always slept, with the house dog at his feet, ready to defend the place if burglars should take a sudden fancy to visit it during the small hours of the night. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/>The dog growled, but hearing my voice, gave a kind of satisfactory snort, and betook himself to slumber again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>I stole cautiously up the creaking stairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>A gust of air coming from the landing place, nearly blew my light out, and, shading it with my hand, I saw that a small, arched door opposite the stairs, which I had never noticed before, stood ajar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>It seemed to lead into a narrow passage &mdash; and wondering much how it could have escaped my notice, I stepped in. Another door, strongly barred with iron, was just before me. I hesitated a moment &mdash; but something stronger than mere curiosity &mdash; a kind of breathless interest, that startled me, led me on. I opened it. Not easily, however,--till it was suddenly wrenched from my hand by some <num value="1">one</num> inside &mdash; so suddenly that I almost fell into a large, square room, hung with dark curtains, and only lighted by an iron lamp, in a wire case, that hung high up on the wall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>The door closed gently behind me, but I could see no person in the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/>Yet something certainly wrenched it from my grasp. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/> I suppose I felt afraid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/>I remember I was very much inclined to whistle or sing &mdash; just as I used to be when in my boyhood I had to pass a lonely church-yard at night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/>I walked into the middle of the room, and put my lamp down on the floor, because there was no chair or table on which I could leave it. Then I took a long look at my surroundings, feeling more and more like whistling every moment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="889"/> Not a picture hung on the wall &mdash; not an article of furniture made the place more home- like.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="890"/>A low divan ran around the room; at <num value="1">one</num> end it widened, and was furnished with blankets, counterpanes and pillows, now tossed into a confused heap.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="891"/>The windows were heavily shuttered and barred &mdash; the gate was also barred in, and wired &mdash; the shovel, poker and tongs had been removed, also the fender &mdash; the floor felt strangely beneath my feet, and I bent down to examine it. It was <q>&#x0022;padded&#x0022;</q> and covered over with elastic matting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="892"/>I touched the walls, they were not hung with black drapery, as I had <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> imagined, but padded also, and covered with a cloth looking and feeling like leather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="893"/>What a strange mystery is this, in this quiet, out of the way place?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="894"/>Who dwelt in this room where safety was evidently the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing studied, where even the solitary lamp twinkled, like a star, far out of reach?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="895"/>I sat down on the divan and wondered at my discovery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="896"/> At last, as my eyes grew accustomed to the darkness of the place, I saw something stir near the bed &mdash; a moment later, I heard a low sigh. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="897"/> <q>&#x0022;Who sighs so?&#x0022;</q> I asked with a beating heart. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="898"/> A tall, dark figure rose from the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="899"/>It sounds romantic at this distance of time, but it seemed anything but romatic then. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="900"/> I was almost frightened to death, and had no power to speak or stir, as it advanced slowly toward me. Clad in a long, dark robe, like the habit of a monk, a man stood before me, pale, wasted and with long, white hair, and a beard like snow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="901"/>He gazed at me a moment in silence, and then sighed again heavily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="902"/>I gathered up my courage and said to myself that I must be dreaming, and that my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> word would scare the illusion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="903"/> <q>&#x0022;Who are you, and how came you here?&#x0022;</q> I asked. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="904"/> <q>&#x0022;I am a lost soul,&#x0022;</q> he said in a melancholy voice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="905"/><q>&#x0022;Lost forever, and forever, and forever.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="906"/> Again he sighed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="907"/>Heaven knows that I am as matter-of fact as any lawyer can very well be, and have little faith to spare for visions and hallucinations; but there was something so awful in his look and tone, that my blood ran cold; and for the moment I believed that what I had heard was true. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="908"/> <q>&#x0022;But why do you seek me?&#x0022;</q> I managed to say. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="909"/> <q>&#x0022;You were to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="910"/>You came,&#x0022;</q> said the sad voice; <q>&#x0022;but will you help me?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="911"/> <q>&#x0022;How can

<milestone unit="sentence" n="912"/>I?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="913"/> He drew nearer, and bent down, clasping and unclasping his hands in a strange nervous way. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="914"/> <q>&#x0022;There was blood upon the stairs to-night, I suppose, when you came up?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="915"/> <q>&#x0022;Upon the stairs?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="916"/>Why &mdash; no!&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="917"/> <q>&#x0022;No.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="918"/>Are you sure?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="919"/> <q>&#x0022;Quite.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="920"/> <q>&#x0022;No blood!&#x0022;</q> He kept repeating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="921"/><q>&#x0022;It is very strange.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="922"/>It is all because I did not go myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="923"/>If I had been out I should have cut her throat from ear to ear, you know; and that would have made a beautiful path to walk in&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="924"/> I nodded, though my heart died within me. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="925"/> <q>&#x0022;You know her blood is like the carmine,&#x0022;</q> he went on. <q>&#x0022;I cut her once &mdash; before she put me here &mdash; and you might have painted a house with it. You would be charmed to see the color &mdash; would you not!&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="926"/> <q>&#x0022;No doubt, sir.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="927"/> <q>&#x0022;Well, then, I promise you some.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/>I can find my way to her, only you must lead me through the passage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="929"/>I can't go through there alone &mdash; I always see him if I do.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="930"/> <q>&#x0022;Who?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="931"/> <q>&#x0022;<persName><foreName>Charles</foreName></persName> &mdash; my <persName><roleName n="Brother">brother</roleName> <foreName>Charles</foreName></persName>, you know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/>It is very odd,&#x0022;</q> he added in an injured tone; <q>&#x0022;the minister said he was in heaven; and, if that is the case, I don't see why he should always stay in that passage, and keep me from going out.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933"/> <q>&#x0022;Shall I go and see if he is there now?&#x0022;</q> I said, fancying a chance of escape. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/> <q>&#x0022;No,&#x0022;</q> he answered, in a terrible voice, while his eyes began to gleam.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/><q> &#x0022;On <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> thought, I shall not go to her &mdash; she shall come to us &mdash; I know how I can bring her.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936"/> He snatched up the lamp I had left on the floor, and held it so that the flame touched the padding on the wall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="937"/>In another moment it would have been on fire, but the real danger drove the imaginary out of my head, and I sprang upon him. He dropped the lamp and caught me in his powerful arms; I managed to trample out the flame, and then gave all my strength to the task of keeping his talon-like fingers from my throat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="938"/>Up and down the padded room we struggled, fighting for life and death, yet making no noise and uttering no cry. The stillness terrified me. What would I not have given to have heard the sharp bark of Towser below. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="939"/> It seemed an hour &mdash; I suppose it was not really more than <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure>. But the maniac's strength seemed to increase as mine gave way; he held <num value="1">one</num> of my hands behind me, and, though I kept him off for a time with the other, he fastened upon my throat at last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="940"/>We had struggled down to the barred door; it was not quite shut, and in utter desperation I cried aloud for help.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="941"/>The maniac ground his teeth, and uttered a strange cry; the blood rushed to my head as his hands tightened about my neck; my eyes seemed <unclear>ting</unclear> from their sockets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="942"/>I was just <unclear>gasp</unclear> last prayer for mercy, when I heard <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> a noise upon the stairs, the door burst open; the great dog flew in with a low growl, and after him came <persName><foreName>Jim</foreName></persName>, who flung himself upon the madman, and loosened his grasp in an instant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="943"/>I saw no more, for I went into a long swoon then that was almost like death. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="944"/> When, with much pain and anguish, sense and reason came back to me, I opened my eyes, and saw <persName><foreName>Jim</foreName></persName> bending over me, bathing my lips and temples with brandy and water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="945"/>I was lying on the kitchen settee; the grey dawn was stealing through the window, and Towser was sitting bolt upright in the middle of the floor, watching for my recovery with an anxious eye. He whined and wagged his bushy tail when I spoke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="946"/><persName><foreName>Jim</foreName></persName> held the brandy to my lips; he was pale, and a contused mark over his eye showed that he had not rescued me without danger on his part. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="947"/> <q>&#x0022;In the name of Heaven, who was it, <persName><foreName>Jim</foreName></persName>?&#x0022;</q> I asked. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="948"/> <q>&#x0022;Take some more brandy, sir. How in the world did you come to be in there with him?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/> I told him how the outer door was ajar, and how the other <num value="1">one</num> had been opened for me. He gave a long, low whistle, and shook his head. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="950"/> <q>&#x0022;It's missus' fault &mdash; and I often tells her we shall all be killed in our beds some night, if she will go on visiting him. It always drives him wild.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="951"/>And to-night she must have gone off crying, as she often does, poor thing &mdash; and so forgotten to see that the doors were quite safe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>It's a living mercy I heard you, sir.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/> <q>&#x0022;But who is he, <persName><foreName>Jim</foreName></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="954"/>And why is he here, instead of being in a proper mad-house?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="955"/> <q>&#x0022;That's her fault, too, as I tells her often enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="956"/>You see, sir, he was taken this way not long after they were married.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="957"/> <q>&#x0022;Good Heavens, is he her husband?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="958"/> <q>&#x0022;Yes, sir, I may say it to you &mdash; though every <num value="1">one</num> thinks he's dead, except the parson.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="959"/>He knows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="960"/>And the doctor, he knows too. It's a long story, and not over and above pleasant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="961"/>He went mad <num value="2">two</num> year's after she married him, and killed his <persName><roleName n="Brother">brother</roleName> <foreName>Charles</foreName></persName>--leastwise he stabbed him in that little passage, and he never got over it. But it was all hushed up &mdash; and the people thought he went to a mad house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="962"/>Afterward they thought he died.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="963"/>But missus had that room fitted up, and has always kept him there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="964"/>I mean to see to the bolts myself after this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="965"/>He's fast enough now &mdash; and I've got the key of the passage in my pocket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="966"/>I'm main glad missus didn't hear you, though.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="967"/> <q>&#x0022;And so am I.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="968"/>But, <persName><foreName>Jim</foreName></persName>, I wouldn't stay under the same roof with him another night for <num value="1000000">millions</num>.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="969"/> He smiled. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="970"/> <q>&#x0022;Oh!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="971"/>it's nothing when <num value="1">one</num> gets used to it. Look at missus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="972"/>Who would fancy she had a raving maniac in charge?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="973"/> Who, indeed?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="974"/>I drank some more brandy, and going up to my own room, packed my port-manteau, and prepared for my journey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="975"/>At <num value="7">seven</num> I came into the breakfast room, and lo!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="976"/>there was <persName n="Bell,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00438" reg="mostcommon:Bell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Bell</surname></persName>, fresh and smiling as the morning, hovering about me with a <num value="1000">thousand</num> attentions, little dreaming that I had by chance discovered the tragedy of her life, and nearly paid my own in forfeit thereby.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="977"/>I shook hands with her as <persName><foreName>Jim</foreName></persName> brought around the fly, and looked at her wonderingly, waving her 'kerchief, and smiling as gaily as a girl of <measure n="16years" type="date">sixteen years</measure>, when we drove away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="978"/><persName><foreName>Jim</foreName></persName> looked at her too &mdash; then at me &mdash; and whistled <q>&#x0022;Jock o' Hazledean.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="979"/> <q>&#x0022;Strange things happen every day, if we only knew them,&#x0022;</q> he said, as he acknowledged the gratuity I presented him at the station.--<q>&#x0022;But for all that, I hope we shall see you and <persName><roleName n="Master">Master</roleName> <foreName>Hartington</foreName></persName>, too, next summer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="980"/>I'll take good care you'll not be troubled yonder again.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="981"/> But I never went; <num value="1">one</num> visit to <placeName key="tgn,2058529" n="1.000 2" reg="deepwater, henry, missouri">Deepwater</placeName> was quite enough for me. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
