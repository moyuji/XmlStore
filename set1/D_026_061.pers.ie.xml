<head>&#x0022;Running the <rs type="place">Churches</rs>.&#x0022;</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> In a late epistle of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> upon ecclesiastical matters, he states that he is not capable of &#x0022;running the <rs type="place">Churches</rs>,&#x0022; and that he does not intend to take charge of any Church on any side. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> What the creature means by &#x0022;running the <rs type="place">Churches</rs>,&#x0022; we were at a loss for some time to comprehend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>His letter is a reply to a petition from <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName>, requesting that a certain clergyman of that city be reinstated in his pulpit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The rail-splitter demises to do it, and says he &#x0022;cannot undertake to <unclear></unclear> the churches.&#x0022; As he has found no difficulty in running his armies, and has got them to such a perfection of speed that nothing on <num value="2">two</num> leg can overtake them, we marvel that he don't try his hand on the <rs type="place">Churches</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>If they didn't run when they saw him coming, it would be because they are better Christians than we think they are, and go on the principle of resisting the <name>Devil</name> and he will flee from <unclear></unclear> <orgName>office of President</orgName>, once filled by statesmen and gentlemen, he said he &#x0022;intended to run the machine as he found it.&#x0022; It is in the same sense that he talks of &#x0022; It is in the same sense that he talks of &#x0022;not running the <rs type="place">Churches</rs>. &#x0022; He means that he will not undertake to regulate and govern them; that he will not add the <orgName>office of Bishop</orgName> to that of <rs type="role2">President</rs>, that he will not wear a cassock over his coat of mail; that he will not wear the livery of Heaven while be is engaged in the work of Hell, and be canonized upon the calendar as <persName n="Abe,Right-Reverend,David,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="default:Abe,David,,,"><roleName n="Right-Reverend">the Right Reverend</roleName> <foreName>David</foreName> <surname>Abe</surname></persName> If he don't mean this, we are at a loss to know what he does mean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> ought to organize a bureau for the interpretation of <persName><foreName>Abraham</foreName></persName>'s vernacular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The illiterate vulgarian has a slang of his own which is almost as difficult of comprehension as the dialect of the <rs>London</rs> thieves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>What a creature for a President ! If a romance should represent the <rs type="role" reg="Chief Magistrate">Chief Magistrate</rs> of a great country delivering himself in the style of <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, it would be condemned as violating all the laws of probability and nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>But in this instance, as in many others, truth is stranger than fiction. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> Nevertheless, we think we understand the policy which is indicated in this letter declining to reinstate the <rs>St. Louis</rs> clergymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The Confederate clergy are to be turned out of their pulpits, as in <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> and <placeName reg="Portsmouth, Portsmouth, Virginia" key="tgn,7014278">Portsmouth</placeName> and, perhaps, set to work in the streets, like <persName n="Wingfield,Reverend-Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Wingfield,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Reverend-Mister">Rev. Mr.</roleName> <surname>Wingfield</surname></persName>, with a ball and chain, and when the <rs>President</rs> is petitioned to restore them to their sacred offices he vulgarly and cunningly replies that he can't &#x0022;undertake to run the churches.&#x0022; He runs the <rs>Southern</rs> clergy out, and runs Abolitionists in, but he can't take charge of any church on any side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>His subterfuge is as vile as his language is vulgar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Need any man wonder at the brutalities of his underlings, when the prince of all blackguards sits in the <name>Presidential</name> chair of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>? </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The orders was issued by <rs type="role">Gen.</rs> <unclear> </unclear> who expressed himself highly honored in being appointed to lead these time-honored veterans, and as he placed implicit confidence in them he hoped they would give the same to him. Great satisfaction is manifested in this turn of our affairs, as no doubt the bickering and ill-feelings of the contest for the <rs>Major Generalcy</rs> will now cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> Everything is beginning to wear a busy and mystified aspect, as if some movement of the enemy was influencing our own at present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Our pontoons had been laid across the <rs>Holston</rs>, <num value="2">two</num> brigades of infantry thrown across, with some cavalry, towards <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName>, to guard the work of the pioneers building a bridge over Flat <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">Creek</rs>, on the way to <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName>, and there were other signs of a forward movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>This I offered to send him at once; but as he expressed a preference for purchasing it with his own funds, which were in the possession of <persName n="Winder,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00205" reg="mostcommon:Winder,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Winder</surname></persName>, I had the order procured and placed at his disposal.--He did not use it, and, in a subsequent interview, attempted an explanation, but so confused in its character that I changed the conversation to relieve his embarrassment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/> At a later date he sent for me to show me a letter which he had received, informing him of the illness of his father and brother, and of their great desire to see him, and asked me to try and procure his parole for this purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>He urged this on the ground of his being a non- combatant &mdash; assuring me that he had not joined the army from any <unclear></unclear> the <rs>South</rs>--but that, being with support in the line of his profession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>He replied that, under existing difficulties, which had arrested the exchange of prisoners, he did not feel authorized to yield to the sympathy which the case involved, unless by so doing something could be effected towards a general exchange of surgeons and chaplains; but if <rs type="role">Dr.</rs> G. could and would visit <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> for this purpose, and use his own and such other influence as he could obtain to promote this and the plan proposed by <persName n="Ould,Judge,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00207" reg="mostcommon:Ould,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Ould</surname></persName>, then the parole might be granted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>I asked for these conditions in writing, and handed them to <rs type="role">Dr.</rs> G. for his consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>He then signed an agreement to this effect and took a copy for himself.--By the next flag of truce he was permitted to return to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and carried with him the funds which, during his imprisonment, had been in the keeping of the <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">Provost Marshal</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>In parting, I took the liberty of stating to him that my ability to be of service to others would depend very much on his course after his liberation, and expressed the hope that nothing would occur to make me regret my agency in procuring his parole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>And yet, this man, with a worthy name, which he should have changed before prostituting it by ingratitude and false hood, had scarcely reached his home when he began to utter the grossest misrepresentations as to the treatment to which his fellow prisoners and himself had been subjected &mdash; hastened to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, not to comply in good faith with his engagements as an agent for effecting a humane arrangement; but to widen the existing breach &mdash; inflame revenge by his report of cruelties which he knew had never been practiced; and then boast that his statements had stimulated his Government to severe retaliation upon the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldiers in their prisons. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/> As I was connected with his parole, which afforded him the opportunity for attempting to increase the sufferings of others, I deem it a duty to make this statement to correct the false impression which his uncontradicted representation may have produced, and to prevent the misery which might ensue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>My own testimony is as follows: During my visits to <placeName reg="Libby prison">Libby prison</placeName>, to minister to its inmates as need might require, I have often appealed to them, individually and in groups, to know if they had any cause to complain of the treatment which they experienced, assuring them of my readiness to secure the redress of any real grievance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/> Reports were received in the city yesterday of the appearance of a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> force on the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>, which proved to be true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>From passengers by the <placeName key="tgn,7017623" n="1.000 8" reg="york, virginia, united states">York River</placeName> road yesterday afternoon, we get some particulars of this movement, which appears to be merely a raid for the destruction of property.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/> The reported burning of the <rs type="place">Court-House</rs> is not credited by other passengers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>They say that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> came into the county on Monday and camped at <persName n="Armistead,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00277" reg="mostcommon:Armistead,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Armistead</surname></persName> a farm, taking all his corn and provisions.

<head>The force our troops will have to fight this spring.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/> While the armies of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> have been strengthened by the recent conscription and the men already put in the ranks, the <rs>Federal</rs> armies will be much weaker than those they fought last year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>But a few weeks since the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> papers published <num value="2">two</num> important facts--<num value="1">one</num> that the last draft had not added <num value="50000">50,000</num> men to the ranks of their army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>This was official from the <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal-General">Provost Marshal General</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>The other was a statement made by letter writers, that not <num value="40000">40,000</num> of the veterans had re-enlisted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>This last important fact caused alarm in Congress, and in the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>, a few days ago, a resolution was passed calling on the <rs>President</rs> to furnish a list showing &#x0022;the number of re-enlisted veteran volunteers from each State, and other information in this connection.&#x0022; On the <dateStruct value="--1"><day reg="1">1st instant</day></dateStruct> <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00278" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,A.,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> replied to this call, enclosing a letter from the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, who said that, in his opinion, it would be &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">prejudicial to the public service</hi>&#x0022; to transmit to the <rs type="place">House</rs> at the present time the information requested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>The fact is that the drafts in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have proved utter failures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>They have brought paper money in computation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>Paper money won't fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>There is very little personal danger to be apprehended from a bank note, and there is no case on record of a man having been bayonetted by a <measure n="1dollars" type="currency">$1</measure> bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>The new draft, which commenced in the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> States yesterday, will result as all the others have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>The <measure n="300dollars" type="currency">$300</measure> commutation clause is still in force, and the green backs will pour in.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>The commutation might be advanced to <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">$600</measure>, and it would be cheerfully paid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>With our strengthened armies in the field, let our people take courage and do all in their power to sustain them in comfort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>The stage is cleared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>The curtain is slowly rising on the spring campaign.
