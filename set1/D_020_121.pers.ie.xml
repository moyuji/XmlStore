<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> <hi rend="smallcaps">Adversity</hi> is a severe, but healthful discipline for individuals and nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>No man can become truly great who has basked all his life in the sunshine of good fortune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>No man deserves to be called a man who is disheartened by reverses, and who does not know how to gather fresh energy and strength from misfortune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Hope and faith are essential to success in things temporal as well as in things eternal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>It is with a nation as with individuals.--For <num value="7">seven</num> long years did our ancestors struggle through the war of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>They wrestled single-handed with the colossal power of the <rs>British</rs> empire; they were harassed and tormented by <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indians</rs>, by tories, and by traitors; their finances were in a wretched condition; their armies indifferently equipped and disciplined; their personal privations and discomforts were universal and often distressing; they lived on coarse food; wore plain clothing, and submitted without a murmur to the prolonged interruption of the arts, enterprises, and luxuries of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Their armies suffered disaster after disaster, and defeat after defeat; barefooted, cold, hungry, weary, they fought and fell back, fell back and fought, whilst not a ray of light gleamed upon their torn and tattered banners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>With bleeding feet they traversed wintry snows, and with bleeding hearts they toiled on and on through such a winter of discontent as no people ever before passed through and survived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>How often in that long <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure> they must have asked, will this bitter struggle never end?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Are these privations, these perils, these defeats, these midnight storms, to endure forever?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Will the sky never clear up?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Will the morning never come?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>But, in those manly hearts there was no such feeling as despair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>They had put their hand to the plough and they looked not back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Their struggles and wrestlings with adversity only made them stronger and more resolute, and by their fortitude even more than by their valor, they fairly wearied out the most obstinate nation under Heaven, and wrung from her reluctant hands the golden prize of liberty and independence. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>They have not yet been called upon to show that they can endure as well as dare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>War is in general an alternation of victory and defeat of good and bad fortune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>We have hitherto enjoyed a succession of triumphs almost unparalleled in the history of wars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Our military achievements have been brilliant and prodigious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>At the beginning of the contest it seemed as if the <rs>South</rs> must be crushed like an egg-shell by her gigantic adversary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>The enemy had the national exchequer, the national army, the national navy, the capital, the wealth, the manufacturing industry, the vast preponderance of arms, munitions, and equipments of war, and a population outnumbering us <num value="3">three</num> to <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>What have we to discourage us?

If we are, if, in defence of our soil, our homes, our wives and children, our honor and independence, we cannot endure discomfitures and defeats when they occur, with as much patience and hopefulness as our enemy exhibits in a bad cause, then we shall not achieve our liberty, and are not worthy of it. We cannot expect to be always victorious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Such slight reverses and misfortunes as have occasionally occurred to our arms, have scarcely been sufficient to show to ourselves, or to the world, the real pith and endurance of Southern character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Hitherto our brilliant sky has only been chequered now and then by an April cloud, yet there are those who look upon every passing vapor as the presage of eternal night, and who imagine, with every shadow that tempers the heat of a glorious sun, that midnight has come, and fill the air with owl-like hootings.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/> It is considered in military circles that the taking of the forts by the naval vessels is a great achievement indeed, for it has generally been held that guns on shipboard could not contend, except at great odds, with batteries on shore protected from shells by casemates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>The movement of the vessels prevented accurate sighting for the guns in the batteries, and as the latter were constructed with reference to a land attack as well as <num value="1">one</num> at sea, their guns were hardly brought to bear. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/> In respect to accuracy in sighting guns, it may be stated that not only the captain and <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> captain of every gun on board ship are good gunners, but nearly every seaman and ordinary seaman are habitually exercised in sighting.
