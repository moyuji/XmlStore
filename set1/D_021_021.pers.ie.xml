<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> <measure n="6months" type="date">Six months</measure> ago last Tuesday the great <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">battle of Manassas</rs> was fought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>If we may regret that it was not followed up by the capture of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, which would have fallen into our hands without resistance, it is some consolation to reflect that the memorable Southern victory of the <date value="07-21">21st July</date> administered a blow to the enemy from which they have not recovered to this day. It has been productive of results such as have rarely flowed from a single great victory in the outset of a war. Who could imagine any great <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> power, boasting the immense resources of the <rs>North</rs> in men and munitions, which after <num value="1">one</num> great defeat could not be able to take the field again in <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>? It is true that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have since organized an immense army, numbering, they pretend, <num value="200000">two hundred thousand</num> in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and <num value="600000">six hundred thousand</num> in all, thoroughly drilled and disciplined, and provided with an enormous amount and endless variety of warlike weapons, and yet this gigantic host has not dared to this day to make an advance upon the old battle ground, where <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> ago they met the <rs>South</rs> in that fatal trial of a <sic>ma.</sic> This fact alone is more damaging to there prestige and their cause than if the <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">battle of Manassas</rs> had been followed up by the capture of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The world has looked at their colossal preparations and their pig my performance, at the mountain in labor and the mouse which it has brought forth, and has drawn conclusions more fatal to their reputation than if they had lost a <num value="100">hundred</num> battles. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> The beautiful weather, reaching into the very heart of winter, has invited them to some on, but its allurements have proved too weak for their discretion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The convulsive attempt at <placeName reg="Leesburg, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2112647">Leesburg</placeName>, which-resulted in more terrific destruction, in proportion to the numbers engaged, than the <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">battle of Manassas</rs>, or almost any battle on record, could not provoke <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> to retrieve the eclipse which had come upon his sun in the very act of amarging from the horizon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>With everything in the machinery of war that any General could desire, the steam for propelling the massive mechanism was wanting, and it still lies stranded, like some huge hulk, on the shores of the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>But, incentive as it is towards its enemies, it has been a huge millstone around the neck of its friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>It has eaten out the very vitals of the <name>Treasury</name> and bankrupted the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">battle of Manassas</rs> has thus demoralized the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in both purse and honor; and, if we have patience and perseverance, will yet compel it to succumb to the manifest destiny of the establishment of Southern independence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> Its effect upon the world at large has been equally great and remarkable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>It has given us a hearing at the tribunal of the nations, and proved to the satisfaction of the most incredulous, as <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Lyons</foreName></persName> pertinently and wittily observed, that the <rs>South</rs> is a belligerent power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>It has elevated the military prestige of the <rs>Southern</rs> people in the eyes of all mankind, and convinced them that the people capable of such things have a cause worth fighting for, as well as a patriotism and perseverance equal to the maintenance of their cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>It has given the <rs>South</rs> itself new confidence in its energies, in the courage of its soldiers, and in the capacity of its <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The heroic blood that was shed there has consecrated the great cause of Southern independence in the hearts of every man, woman, and child in the land, and the immortal victory has illuminated our triumphant heroes with a light which will inspire and guide generations to new and perpetual devotion to liberty and independence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> All honor to the heroes who <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> ago achieved such magnificent results, and who still stand with swords unsheathed to maintain the cause which they have won. All honor to the sons who there defended their mothers, and to the mothers who bore such sons and gave them to their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>All honor to the glorious <rs>Beauregard</rs> and <rs>Johnston</rs>, and to the heroic <rs>President</rs> who presented himself at the altar of that battle and shared its undying renown. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>At all events, he at <num value="1">one</num> time wrote to a prominent Southern officer, indicating his desire to bear arms under the <rs>Southern</rs> flag; and not until he was tempted by the high prize held out to him by the <name>Federalists</name>, did he relinquish a purpose which had all his sympathies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>We do not believe that, even if his abilities are as great as they are represented, he can employ them to the best effect when his head only, and not his heart, is in the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>On the other hand, our own <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, in his front and elsewhere, are not only his superiors in soldiership, but have given their whole souls to the cause in which they are engaged.--They are patriots as well as soldiers; their hearts, as well as their heads, are in the work, and whatever their hands find to do, they will do it with their might.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>This is <num value="1">one</num> cause of the almost uninterrupted stream of Southern victories which has flowed on in a majestic current from the beginning of the war. We do not underrate the magnificent courage of the <rs>Southern</rs> soldiers, but even their unrivalled devotion would have been of no avail unless guided and directed by the splendid military genies of our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Cold stormy weather, chilly winds morning through leafless tress, sweeping in boreal blasts along barren mountain and meadow; fitful showers drizzling destruction on the fair snow; thick fog stealthily looming up from the semi thawing earth; gurgling troubled streams swelling o'er dessicate fields; sad and timid stars lured by <q> &#x0022;the momentary blue sky;&#x0022;</q> struggling frowning clouds giving dismal glimpses of the pale sky moon; dying campfires emitting spasmodic sparks and a great gloomy silence prevailing all around are the chief features that marked my journey from our out-posts line to this my resting place this night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>His behavior towards her after her arrest was coarse and rude &mdash; just such as might be expected of a Lincoln detective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>He took great delight in alluding to her as she passed a crowd on the street, as a <q>&#x0022;Secesh&#x0022;</q> prisoner, and in various ways endeavored to offend the refined and delicate creature, whom the authority of a base miscreant had made his captive. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>These stories have led us to believe that, thus far, <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> has the better of other seats of hostility for the real romance of war. Most assuredly the fight there has been waged with fiercer earnest than almost anywhere else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>The remote geography of the country, the rough, unsewn character of the people, the intensity and ferocity of the passions excited, and the general nature of the complicity reduced to a warfare essentially partizan and frontier, gave to its progress a wild aspect, peculiarly susceptible to deeds, and suggestive of thoughts, of romantic interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>None of these struck us more forcibly than the story of Norah McCartey, the <rs>Jeanie Deans</rs> of the <rs>West</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/> She lived in the interior of <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>--a little, pretty, black-eyed girl, with a soul as huge as a mountain, and a form as frail as a fairy's and the courage and pluck of a buccaneer into the bargain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>Her father was an old man &mdash; a Secessionist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>She had but a single brother, just growing from boyhood to youth hood, but sickly and lamed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>But even then her beauty, wit, and devil-may-care spirit were known far and wide; and many were the stories told along the border of her sayings and doings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>Among other charges laid to her door, it is said she broke all the hearts of the young bloods far and wide, and tradition does even go so far as to assert that, like <hi rend="italics">Bob Acres,</hi> she killed a man once a week, keeping a private church yard for the purpose of decently burying her dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>Be this as it may, she was then, and is now, a dashing, fine looking, lively girl, and a prettier heroins than will be found in a novel, as will be seen if the good natured reader has a mind to follow us down to the bottom of this column. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/> Not long after the <rs>Federals</rs> came into her neighborhood, and after they had forced her father to take the oath, which he did partly because he was a very old man, unable to take the field, and hoped thereby to save the security of his house hold, and partly because he could not help himself; not long after these <num value="2">two</num> important events in the history of our heroine, a body of men matched up <num value="1">one</num> evening, whilst she was on a visit to a neighbor's, and arrested her stockily, weak brother, bearing him off to Leaven work City, where he wan lodged in the military guard- house. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>Although the mists were falling, and the night was closing in dark and dreary, she ordered her horse to be re-saddled, put on a thick surtout, belted a sash round her waist, and, sticking a pair of ivory-handled pistols in her bosom, started off after the soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>The post was many miles distant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>But that she did not regard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>Over hill, through marsh, under cover of the darkness, she galloped on to the headquarters of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>Our position was such as to enable us to overlook them, and it makes my heart aches when I think of the number of human souls who were hurried into eternity on that day.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/> The defeat which we have sustained in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> is a misfortune to be deplored; but which may be repaired, and, indeed, improved to our advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>The particulars of the battle are as yet too meagre to warrant a safe conclusion as to its causes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>It seems that our army, under command of <persName n="Crittenden,Major-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00093" reg="mostcommon:Crittenden,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>Crittenden</surname></persName>, attended by <persName n="Zollicoffer,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00094" reg="mostcommon:Zollicoffer,Felix,K.,,:1"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</roleName> <surname>Zollicoffer</surname></persName>, marched forth from its entrenchments and attacked the enemy fortified in a strong position on the other side of a stream of water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>The fight seems to have been severe for some time, the enemy acknowledging <measure n="75" type="killed">seventy-five killed</measure> in a single <num value="1">one</num> of his regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>But at an evil moment <persName n="Zollicoffer,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00095" reg="mostcommon:Zollicoffer,Felix,K.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Zollicoffer</surname></persName> was shot down, and then our forces lost all confidence, fell into disorder, and fled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>It is quite plain that they relied upon <persName n="Zollicoffer,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00096" reg="mostcommon:Zollicoffer,Felix,K.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Zollicoffer</surname></persName> in the fight, and that when he fell, they would put no trust in his superior in command, <persName n="Crittenden,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00097" reg="mostcommon:Crittenden,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Crittenden</surname></persName>, and gave up the contest. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/> The report is, that <persName n="Crittenden,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00098" reg="mostcommon:Crittenden,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Crittenden</surname></persName> was in full retreat on the road leading to <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville, Tennessee</placeName>, distant a <measure n="100miles" type="distance">hundred miles</measure> by road from <placeName key="tgn,2041357" n="1.000 4" reg="somerset, pulaski, kentucky">Somerset</placeName>; and the inference cannot be avoided that his army was much disorganized and incapable of a bold stand against the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>The Government here will doubtless take prompt steps to reinforce the retreating army with regiments to form a nucleus for a rally, and with a few batteries to make good a stand in the passes that occur so frequently along the road to <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>A few artillery, <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> competent engineer officers, and another <rs type="role" reg="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</rs> in whom the troops have confidence, will at once put our affairs in that quarter again on their legs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/> The only serious danger resulting from this defeat is the possibility that the enemy may be able to reach the railroad at some point near <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName>, and cut off our communications with the <rs type="place">Mississippi Valley</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>The imminence of this danger is fully appreciated by the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities, and the exigency will be promptly met by the proper measures. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/> There is little danger of any immediate advance of the enemy in the direction of Cumberland Cap, which is a <placeName><distance reg="100miles">hundred miles</distance> from <placeName key="tgn,2041357" n="1.000 4" reg="somerset, pulaski, kentucky">Somerset</placeName></placeName>; and if he should under take such an advance, we have force there strong enough, with the aid of the formidable fortifications guarding its passes, to keep an army at bay. The real danger is of his advance along the route of our own discomfited army, and of his reaching the railroad in the neighborhood of <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName>; but this danger may be very easily guarded against. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/> Unfortunate as this defeat is at this juncture, it may result in great advantage to our cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>An alarming spirit of apathy had taken possession of our people, and to some extent had begun to characterize the action of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>We were not devoting ourselves to the great business of this war like men in earnest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>The only thing that could have occurred to rouse us all to our duty was just such a disaster as this in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>Fortunately, it has occurred at a distance from any vital point, affording time to prepare against evil results that may come from it, and if it but arouse all to their whole duty, it will really prove a godsend to us at a most critical period of this struggle. </p> </div3>

<head>The Northern War debt.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/> The financial condition of the <orgName n="Northern Union" type="union">Northern Union</orgName> presents some of the most remarkable features ever witnessed in public indebtedness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>The amount of debt already incurred, including that which existed before the war began, is at least <num value="750000000">seven hundred and fifty millions</num> of dollars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>There are <num value="600000">six hundred thousand</num> men under arms, and the cost per man of foot soldiers in time of peace has for many years been a <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">thousand dollars</measure>. It would not be extravagant to place the cost at this time, in the midst of war, for infantry, cavalry, and artillery, at <measure n="1500dollars" type="currency">fifteen hundred dollars</measure> per annum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>The peace estimate for a single year at sea is <measure n="60000dollars" type="currency">sixty thousand dollars</measure> a gun; for a single gun on land, <measure n="4000dollars" type="currency">four thousand dollars</measure>. The cost of a cavalry charger, including original price and the keep, under the high prices of war, cannot be less on the average than <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">five hundred dollars</measure> a year; for the average duration of army horses in actual service is less than <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure>. It is therefore a reasonable estimate to put the cost per man in the <rs>Northern</rs> army at <measure n="1500dollars" type="currency">fifteen hundred dollars</measure> a year, including all branches of the service, and counting in the whole naval force as a part of the round <num value="600000">six hundred thousand</num> men under arms in pay of the <rs>Washington Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>This would bring the aggregate cost per annum of the war establishment of the <rs>North</rs> to <num value="900000000">nine hundred millions</num> of dollars, and we have no doubt that when all the settlements come to be finally made in the years succeeding the war, the expenditures will be found to have reached that annual sum. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/> Hostilities have gone on to such a length that it will be impossible to bring peace about at any time short of a year from now, even if vigorous efforts to that end were at once set on foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>And even if peace could be concluded within that period, it would require a long time after its consummation to disband the troops not intended to be retained in the permanent military service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>In fact, the war sealed of expenditures would continue necessarily for several months after the conclusion of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>It would be, therefore, quite in vain to calculate on a cessation of war expenditures within less than <measure n="18months" type="date">eighteen months</measure> from this period, and the <rs>Federal</rs> debt, now <num value="750000000">seven hundred and fifty millions</num>, will have been swollen to <num value="2000">two thousand</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/> The <name>British</name> people enjoy the reputation among their fellow-men of being the most heavily taxed population in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>They number in the <num value="3">three</num> kingdoms and the colonies hard on to <num value="40000000">forty millions</num> of souls, besides the dense native population of several of the countries subject to the <rs>British Crown</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>The <name>British</name> debt chargeable upon this <num value="40000000">forty millions</num> of people is about <num value="4000">four thousand</num> <num value="500000000">five hundred millions</num> of dollars, bearing interest at the rate of <num value="0.03">three per cent</num> per annum. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/> The <orgName n="Northern Union" type="union">Northern Union</orgName> numbers <num value="22000000">twenty-two millions</num> of people, and the debt to which they are already committed and cannot now escape, though not yet all actually incurred, is at least <num value="2000">two thousand</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num> of dollars, bearing interest at the rate nominally of <num value="0.06">six per cent.</num> per annum as to part and <num value="7">seven</num> and <num value="30">30</num>,100ths.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>per cent as to the residue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>If, as will soon be the case, they be compelled to sell their bonds at less than parricides &mdash; say <measure n="85cents" type="currency">eighty-five cents</measure> in the dollar, or less &mdash; then the percentage of interest actually paid, on the amount realized, would be proportionally enhanced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>In fact, it would be a moderate estimate to put the rate of interest on the <rs>Northern</rs> debt at <num value="0.07">seven per cent.</num> The interest on <num value="2000">two thousand</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num> of debt at <num value="0.07">seven per cent</num> is greater than that on <num value="4500">forty-five hundred</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num> of debt at <num value="0.03">three per cent</num>; and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are already committed to a public debt requiring as heavy a taxation as that of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>To meet this taxation, they have but <num value="22000000">twenty-two millions</num> of population, while the <rs>British</rs> empire has <num value="40000000">forty millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>The wealth of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> is proverbial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>Where the <rs>North</rs> boasts their <num value="1000">thousands</num>, the <rs>English</rs> can boast their tens and hundreds of <num value="1000">thousands</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>These facts are sufficient to show the very ugly scrape into which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have got themselves by this unholy war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/> It is impossible with these prospects before them for their finances to stand up. They must break down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>It is the worst state of things ever before presented in the history of public indebtedness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>And here is at least the true solution of the war. It cannot go on without money, and what becomes of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> credit in the face of facts such as the foregoing? </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>Many of them were very noisy and intemperate, and it was found that unless they were placed under strict orders, it would be impossible to keep them under any kind of control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>After they were marched aboard the cars, <persName n="Ander,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00101" reg="mostcommon:Ander,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Ander</surname></persName> on issued orders that none of them should leave the cars; in case any <num value="1">one</num> should disobey the order, he should <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> be hailed, and should be refuse to deed the summons, he should be shot.--Before the train moved off, however, some of the men became very heatless, and evidently showed intentions to run the blockade, if possible, heedless of all consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>His body was removed to <orgName n="the Poor House" type="org">the poor-house</orgName> for burial. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/> The engine shortly afterwards moved some distance down the road, to make room for the incoming train from <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>The spot where <persName><foreName>George</foreName></persName> fell was marked by a pool of mingled blood and brains, which afforded the crowd a lively theme of conversation until near <time value="4oclock">four o'clock</time>, when the firing of muskets was heard in the direction of the train, and a rush made thither.
