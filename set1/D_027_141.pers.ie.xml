<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/> Gentlemen who move peace propositions in Congress and the various Legislatures ought to be very thankful to <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00112" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>His late message must have relieved them of a vast deal of doubt and anxiety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>Determined as they seem to be to have peace on any terms, <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00113" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> has made it quite plain that they can have it on <hi rend="italics">some</hi> terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>Nay, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <rs type="role2">President</rs> goes so far as to state specifically the terms on which it can be had. The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> have only to submit, unconditionally, and such of the inhabitants as have not been <hi rend="italics">active</hi> in rebelling against <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00114" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> will be allowed to breathe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>To this there can surely be no objection on the part of those peace-loving gentlemen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>The ancient <hi rend="italics">dogma</hi> that it is better to lose life and worldly goods than to sacrifice honor, can have no influence, of course, upon enlightened gentlemen of this class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>A small condition is annexed to this gift of life, which, of course, does not impair its value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>The recipients must acquiesce in all the legislation of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Congress and all the proclamations of <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00115" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>They are to be left no property of any kind whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>Their estates, real and personal,--the whole vast territory of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>. --has been declared confiscated, and Congress is called on to abolish slavery by the <num value="2">two</num>- <num value=".333">thirds</num> vote, which it requires to change any clause of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>But your real <hi rend="italics">peace loving</hi> submissionist rather prefers all this. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/> There can be no difficulty now as to the means of making ourselves heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>Before there was some doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/><persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00116" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and his Cabinet positively refused to hear anything the rebels had to say upon any subject whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>Some very wise and very notable schemes have been broached to get over that obstacle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>The principal was, to call a convention of all the <name>States</name>, Confederate and <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>, to confer about the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>But the re-election of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00117" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> by <num value="800000">800,000</num> majority has pretty effectually stopped all that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>Besides, the taking of the peace-making power out of the <rs>President</rs>'s hands and putting it in the hands of a convention was the overthrow of the <rs>Confederate Constitution</rs> and the secession of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>Now, however, there is no necessity for all this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>The States can instruct the <rs>President</rs>, or, it not, they can <hi rend="italics">request</hi> him, to make their submission in form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>He will be heard, no doubt, on that subject, though not upon any other. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/> But the chief benefit afforded by the message, so far as we are concerned, is that it will show the reconstructionists in their true colors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>It affords a test which is absolutely infallible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>The man who offers peace propositions <hi rend="italics">now,</hi> after this, is a <hi rend="italics">reconstructionist,</hi> and can be nothing else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>The object of these men, heretofore, has been to render the <rs>President</rs> unpopular by throwing upon <hi rend="italics">him </hi> the odium of continuing the war. They very well know that no proposition he can make will be officially entertained, or even <hi rend="italics">received,</hi> by <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00118" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>They require him to do what is impossible, and rail against him because he does not do it. <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00119" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> now says that he will receive no proposition but of unqualified submission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>If gentlemen, then, expect their peace propositions to be heard, they must found them upon absolute submission. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
