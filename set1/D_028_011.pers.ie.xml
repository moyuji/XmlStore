<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> The issuing of letters of marque by <persName n="Juarez,ex-President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Juarez,nomatch:0"><roleName n="ex-President">ex-President</roleName> <surname>Juarez</surname></persName> to <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs>, against <name>French</name> ships, and especially against steamers of the <rs>French Trans-Atlantic Company</rs>, is said by the <hi rend="italics">Shipping Gazette,</hi> in a paragraph copied in this journal some days ago, to be confirmed by advices from <placeName key="tgn,7008482" n="1.000 3" reg="nantes,loire-atlantique,pays de la loire,france,europe">Nantes</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/><num value="1">One</num> of these steamers, having on board &#x00A3;<num value="200000">200,000</num> in specie, was convoyed from <placeName reg="Veracruz, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,7005599">Vera Cruz</placeName> by a French man-of-war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> If this be a fact, it is <num value="1">one</num> of no inconsiderable interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>We are surprised that <persName n="Juarez,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Juarez,nomatch:0"><surname>Juarez</surname></persName> has not before adopted this obvious mode of harassing his enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The example of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> has shown that a few fast ships can drive a larger commerce than that of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> from the face of the ocean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The ships of war of no nation can afford adequate protection to its merchantmen, and <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, powerful as she is on land, has never been distinguished by naval aptitude and enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>We can only conclude that <persName n="Juarez,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Juarez,nomatch:0"><surname>Juarez</surname></persName> must have been hitherto dissuaded by the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States Government</orgName> from adopting a means of annoyance and retaliation which, effective as it is, might ultimately lead to a collision between the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, Whether that opposition, for reasons best known to itself, has been withdrawn by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, or whether <persName n="Juarez,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Juarez,nomatch:0"><surname>Juarez</surname></persName> has determined to consult only his own inclinations, and accept the ready aid of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> privateers, remains to be seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>In any event, the issuing of letters of marque is a measure which will give <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> a fresh annoyance, and which may lead to serious complications between the <num value="2">two</num> Governments. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> The gusto with which <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> privateers would avail themselves of such license may easily be imagined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/><persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Seward,W.,H.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName> could not restrain them, even if he had the disposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Such prospects of wholesale plunder would be too tempting for the sternest <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> virtue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>It would be useless to point out to them that by embarrassing the relations of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> it might prevent the rebellion, which is now positively making its last appearance on any boards. &#x0022;A bird in the hand,&#x0022; in the opinion of that practical people, &#x0022;is worth <num value="2">two</num> in the bush.&#x0022; If <persName n="Juarez,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Juarez,nomatch:0"><surname>Juarez</surname></persName> has, in reality, issued letters of marque to <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> ships every <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> harbor will swarm with fast-going vessels, now unemployed in consequence of <persName n="Semmes,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Semmes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Semmes</surname></persName>; and they will make up the losses inflicted by that enterprising pirate by imitating his example with astonishing energy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>To do them justice, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, as privateers and pirates, have few equals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/><persName n="Kidd,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Kidd,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Kidd</surname></persName>, in his palmiest days, never approached them in dash and rapacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>They will carry off <name>French</name> merchantmen from under the very guns of their men-of-war, and in <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> from the time they begin operations a French trading vessel will not be seen on the ocean. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> We fear the thing is too good to be true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>But, if so, where will <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> find protection for her commerce?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Will she have to resort, as the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have done, to the <rs>English</rs> flag?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>That would be too sore a humiliation for the grand nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>But it would be no refuge. --<rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> privateersmen, though honest and scrupulous as their nation in general proverbially is, might make mistakes.--Laboring under the delusion that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> has been the real privateer of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and is the responsible party </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> for all the damages they have suffered, their eyes might be blinded and their bitter principles overcome by the combined influence of revenge and rich cargoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>They might choose to consider the <rs>English</rs> flag, whenever they met it, a mere cover for fraud and humbug--<num value="2">two</num> things which are especially abhorrent to <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>In this way they might render the ocean as unsafe a highway for English as <name>French</name> commerce, and make the whole maritime world pay tribute to their enterprise. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> If <persName n="Juarez,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Juarez,nomatch:0"><surname>Juarez</surname></persName> has adopted this policy, he is a very sensible man for a <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The commercial acquisitions which the <rs>Emperor</rs> sought in obtaining <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> would be reduced by <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> privateering to a very fine point indeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>He would either have to give in to the <rs>Monroe</rs> doctrine, as interpreted by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>, and take himself out of the country, or be drifted into a war with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>If it were <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Palmerston</foreName></persName>, we should have no hesitation in predicting his course.--He would immediately make a profound obeisance to <persName n="Seward,,W.,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="default:Seward,W.,H.,,"><foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>, pack up his <rs n="carpet bag" type="product">carpet bag</rs> and be off. But there is some national and military pride in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>She is never unprepared to fight, and therefore may be disposed to risk conclusions with <persName><roleName n="Brother">Brother</roleName> <foreName>Jonathan</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The only mischief the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> can inflict is upon her commerce; and if she must suffer that without a war, there could be no great hazard in attempting a little retaliation. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> It may well be doubted whether the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, with all its braggadocio, can ever raise again such armies as those which have already taken the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The half-<num value="1000000">million</num> draft of last year yielded only <num value="70000">seventy thousand</num> effectives, and it is the opinion of the most intelligent Northern men that a resort to conscription would break down the war. If our own affairs are wisely conducted, and our resources of men and material judiciously husbanded, we have no reason for discouragement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>If we are conquered, it will not be by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, but by ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Most of the misfortunes we now suffer are the results of our own faults and blunders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>It would be a miserable fate enough to be overwhelmed and subjugated by sheer force; but to perish by our own folly and mismanagement is too horrible to think of. Every public man, every official, high and low, in every branch of the service, should realize the fearful weight of responsibility that now rests upon those to whom the country has entrusted the success of its cause. </p> </div3>
