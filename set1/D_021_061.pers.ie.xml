<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>We are not surprised to hear that it is decidedly the sentiment of delegates of the <rs>Southern States</rs> now here in Congress, that laws for the exemption of printers from militia service should be enacted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>To refuse this, is to deprive the <rs>Southern</rs> people of the press, to shut them out completely from all intelligence of affairs in which they are deeply interested, and to take away from them incentives to patriotism and energy which the press daily pours forth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> exhibit a vast amount of indifference in regard to the slaughter of their soldiery by the <rs>Confederates</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>At the very beginning of the war, they exulted in the idea that they had a large surplus of foreign and vicious population, which it would be a blessing to be rid of, and which would make excellent food for powder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>Their policy towards the foreign population has been as adroit as the stupidity of the imbeciles who are the luckless victims of their selfishness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>They have always regarded the foreign population as a curse, and only <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure> ago got on foot a political crusade to deprive them of all civil and religious rights, which, but for the interposition of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, would have been eminently successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>They had willingly employed the foreign labor upon their canals, railroads, and farms, and in their warehouses and kitchens, but had no idea of permitting them to rise above the condition of virtual serfdom which they occupied in their own country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>They accordingly organized a powerful party to put them down and keep them down in the same relation to their superiors that they held in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/><placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and the whole <rs>South</rs> resisted that notable scheme, and resisted it successfully, not from any peculiar admiration of foreigners, or from any red <rs n="Republican" type="political">republican</rs> notions of universal equality, but on the ground of principle and justice.--The South had no interests to subserve by taking this course, for there are few foreigners in the <rs>South</rs>, and she had labor enough without their aid, and a kind of labor which she prefers to any that could be imported &mdash; That the foreigners of the <rs>North</rs> should become the chief agency employed for her destruction, is <num value="1">one</num> of the most flagrant examples of ingratitude that history records; but it was not for the men, but the principles of the <rs>Government</rs>, that the <rs>South</rs> contended, and she has, therefore, no reason for self-reproach. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/> It is not to be wondered at that the <rs>North</rs>, which so short a time ago would have deprived foreigners of all political and civil rights, should now manifest the most supreme indifference to their slaughter on the battlefield.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>The only need she has of them is to perform her labor in peace and fight her battles in war. She has a supply so large that the places of those who fall can at once be filled, and the greater the number that is slain the less powerful becomes an element in her society which the mass of her population look upon with aversion and distrust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/> You have aptly remarked in <num value="1">one</num> of your recent editorials that the &#x0022;entire South is in a blaze of patriotic enthusiasm.&#x0022; There is not a city, town, village or hamlet that is not now responding to the call upon it for all men capable of bearing arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>New volunteer companies are springing into existence every day; the old are being strengthened by fresh recruits, and the spirit of resistance begins to resemble the fervid, whole-souled aspirations of our revolutionary forefathers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>Every hand in the community is doing something to aid the cause, even though it be but the widow's mite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>The women are praying and working, and the men are bucking on their armor for the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>Homespun has taken the place of silks and satins, and every house is a manufactory where, from the gray-haired grandmother to the child of <num value="10">ten</num>, all are united in the labor of fabricating garments for the soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>Such is the aspect of social affairs in every State of the <rs>South</rs>, and particularly in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/> Not less promising is the military aspect of affairs, and especially so with reference to the condition of defences in and around <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>While traveling hither I found everywhere an impression prevailing that the city could not possibly withstand a serious attack of the enemy, and would fall almost of its own accord.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>In fact, absurd as were many of the statements made, their continual repetition from various sources had imbued my own mind with a similar belief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>You can, therefore, judge of my gratifying surprise on arriving here and finding how totally different was the reality from the rumor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>There is no city in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, with the same means at its disposal, better fortified than <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>If possible, it is even stronger than <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, and any <num value="1">one</num> acquainted with the defences there is aware of its comparative impregnability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>The water defences on the <placeName reg="Savannah River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,2645404">Savannah river</placeName> are daily being improved in strength; the best of military skill and ingenuity is employed upon the work; guns are mounted and ready for action; the movements of the enemy are carefully watched; and, in a word, we are ready for the long-expected demonstration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>The same may be said of the fortifications on land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>Entrenchments completely environ the city and guard the avenues of approach; strong batteries protect the assailable <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creeks</rs> and inlets; the troops are all disposed and ready for action; the woods for miles around, containing their encampments, and even the marshes, have been prepared to play their part in the coming drama. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/> The great delay of the <rs>Federals</rs> has led to the supposition in many military minds that their presence off <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> and <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> is merely a feint to prevent reinforcements from being sent from <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> and <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> to other points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>But on the other hand, the high authority of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00232" reg="nearbymention:Lee,N.,M.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> has pronounced the belief that the enemy will make an advance, and endeavor to secure these <num value="2">two</num> localities, which they so bitterly despise, and that they are only awaiting reinforcements, and the completion of operations in the <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creeks</rs>, by which they expect to be able to get into the <placeName reg="Savannah River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,2645404">Savannah river</placeName>, and thence to the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>If they know the difficulties they will have to encounter at every step of the undertaking for miles before they reach even the suburbs, they would hesitate long before engaging in an attempt which can only prove disastrous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>Let no <num value="1">one</num> judge of the future by the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>If the misapprehension has gone forth that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> can remove other obstructions as easily as they have done the piles planted in the smaller channels, let it be forgotten.--These were intended to obstruct, delay, and give us time, and they have fully answered our purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>To defend these obstructions was a matter of impossibility; <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, because they were miles beyond the reach of our guns; and, secondly, because the nature of the surrounding marsh prevented the erection of batteries for the purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>Complaint has frequently been made by those unfamiliar with the facts, that we did not keep open the communication with <placeName key="tgn,2024563" n="1.000 48" reg="tybee island, tybee island, chatham, georgia">Fort Pulaski</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>Our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> did all in their power to effect that object, but the very topography of the country was against them, and a formal consultation decided upon the military necessity of concentrating the troops more nearly around <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, and leaving <placeName key="tgn,2024563" n="1.000 48" reg="tybee island, tybee island, chatham, georgia">Fort Pulaski</placeName>, with its <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> of provisions, to the mercies of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>Time will show the wisdom of this step. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/> The question may be asked by many, what have the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> accomplished since they invested <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>The reply is a very brief <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>They have seized <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> islands of no earthly consequence to any body, and less so to themselves, for they are the breeding spot of every foul disorder incident to malarious soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/><num value="1">One</num> of these is <placeName reg="York Island, Lee, Florida" key="tgn,2785817">York Island</placeName> in the <placeName reg="Savannah River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,2645404">Savannah river</placeName>, and divides the north from south channel leading to <placeName key="tgn,2024563" n="1.000 48" reg="tybee island, tybee island, chatham, georgia">Fort Pulaski</placeName>.--On this is planted a battery of <num value="7">seven</num> guns, and thus the blockade of that stronghold is completed, without the aid of ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>Opposite to this, about <measure n="500yards" type="distance">five hundred yards distant</measure>, is <placeName reg="Jones's Island">Jones's Island</placeName>, on which another battery of <num value="5">five</num> guns is planted for a similar purpose.--The next Island to <placeName reg="York, York, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014650">York</placeName>, and nearest <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, is <placeName key="tgn,7006197" n="1.000 46" reg="isola d' elba">Elba</placeName>, a stretch of marsh <num value="2.5">two and a half</num> or <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> in length and half a mile or more in breadth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>The lower end of this is only a rifle shot from <placeName reg="York Island, Lee, Florida" key="tgn,2785817">York Island</placeName>, and has been alternately visited by Federals and Confederates, but only for purposes of reconnaissance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/> I understand that yesterday a detachment of our men applied the torch among the tall reeds at this end, and in an hour, with a brisk wind blowing, the entire marsh was swept clear of all obstructions to the vision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>The distance from the upper end of <placeName key="tgn,7006197" n="1.000 46" reg="isola d' elba">Elba</placeName> to <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Fort Jackson</placeName>, which is <measure n="2.5miles" type="distance">two and a half miles</measure> below the city, on the right bank, is about <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure>--may be, a little less, but within easy shelling distance with mortars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>I understand that the <rs>Federals</rs> have secured <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> flats between the <num value="2">two</num> islands above named, and my fear is that on some dark night a force of men will cross the island, land <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> heavy mortars from these flats, and put up a battery which can open upon us in the morning. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/> When you remember that each mortar is protected by a huge mound of earth in front of it, and occupies a space not much larger than <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <measure n="20feet" type="distance">twenty feet</measure> square at the most, you can readily imagine how little would be the execution we could do at that distance with so small a mark, and how great might be their own when directed against our more extended line of work. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/> Beyond these demonstrations, which are as yet purely imaginary, there is no danger to anticipate, and I believe I speak the minds of the <rs>Generals</rs> in command when I say that they feel the utmost confidence in their ability to check any <sic>ufrther</sic> advance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/> How it will be done, it is of course improper to state, but the means are already in process of creation, and will be effective. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/> You might well suppose that a city surrounded as is <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> with soldiers, must necessarily be a lively place; but I have been surprised during my stay here to see upon the streets comparatively few among the <num value="1000">thousands</num> encamped so near.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>Straggling from camp is not permitted, and even the officers are brought under a rigid discipline which restricts them to their lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>There are no drunken people to be seen, and the whole town wears a sober, serious, earnest face, as if it was prepared for the emergency with which it is threatened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>There are no parties, few evening gatherings, little visiting, and little or none of the galley for which, in times past, the beautiful capital has been celebrated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>The deposits in the banks have, to a great extent, been removed, old wares and family plates have taken a similar direction, and some of the ladies who are more frightened than hurt have gone into the interior; but the majority of the residents still remain, and the wheels of trade revolve as usual. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/> Of course in this attitude of affairs, every man in the city capable of bearing arms, and not legally exempt, is in service, and when the striking hour approaches, the old men too are prepared to fall into the ranks and fight by the side of their sons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>Georgians have not yet run in this revolution, and you may be sure they will never leave their homes while a drop of their blood remains to consecrate the soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>Among those whom I have found under arms and doing effective, active service on the outposts, is <persName n="Wiltberger,,W.,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00233" reg="default:Wiltberger,W.,H.,,"><foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Wiltberger</surname></persName>, <rs type="role">Esq.</rs>, well known for the last <num value="30">thirty</num> or <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> as &#x0022;mine host&#x0022; of the <rs type="place">Pulaski House</rs>, and the proprietor of the beautiful &#x0022;Bonaventure&#x0022; estate.
