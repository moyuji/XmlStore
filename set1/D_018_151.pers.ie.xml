<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> --There is a peep today for those who had rather secure the rights of the <rs>South</rs> in the <rs>Union</rs>, than go out of it to seek them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The dawn comes from <placeName reg="New Jersey" key="tgn,7007565">New Jersey</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>I do not know how you are upon the question of disunion, but I take it for granted that you think, as I believe a large majority of the people at the <rs>South</rs> think and hold, that matters have now come to such a pass, between the <name>North</name> and <name>South</name> that they must be settled &mdash; in the <rs>Union</rs> if we can, but if we cannot, then out of the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> Supposing these to be not only your sentiments, but the sentiments of the great body of the <rs>Southern</rs> people, it gives me pleasure to inform you of a move which is now on the tapis in <placeName reg="New Jersey" key="tgn,7007565">New Jersey</placeName>, the effect of which, I am persuaded, will be not only to secure to the <rs>South</rs> her rights in the <rs>Union</rs>, but to give the <rs>Union</rs> itself a new lease upon time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> <placeName reg="New Jersey" key="tgn,7007565">New Jersey</placeName> is <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>Old</rs> <num value="13">Thirteen</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>No State North of <placeName reg="Mason, Sussex, Virginia" key="tgn,2495710">Mason</placeName> and <placeName reg="Dixon, Lee, Illinois" key="tgn,2027503">Dixon</placeName>'s line has been more faithful, loyal and true to the <rs>Constitution</rs>; and none has been more mindful of the rights of the sister States under it than she; and there is not <num value="1">one</num> among them all that commands more of the respect and confidence of the <rs>Southern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Availing herself of the proud position which she occupies, the plan proposed is that she shall undertake the office of mediator between the sections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>As far as I understand it, the outlines are these: She is to send a Commissioner to the <name>Conventions</name> of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, etc., to ask of the sovereignties, there assembled, for a statement of the terms and conditions upon which they will be content to remain in the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Having thus obtained from the people of the <rs>South</rs> acting, those of each State in their sovereign capacity, their ultimatum, she is to bring it before her sister States of the <rs>North</rs> for their action, with the request that those who are willing to accede to it will instruct their <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> and request their Representatives to go for and act, incorporating the terms of it as amendments to the <rs>Constitution</rs>, to be thence referred, according to its provisions, back to the <name>States</name> for ramification. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> Thus our friends at the <rs>North</rs> will have something tangible to go upon, and something around which the solid men, the quiet men, of the country, both <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, <name>East</name> and <name>West</name>, may rally. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> Having thus fully ascertained directly from the people of the <rs>South</rs> what will satisfy them in this Union, it will remain for those of the <rs>North</rs> to accede to it, and save the <rs>Union</rs>, or to refuse it, and so break up the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>But there is no fear of any such alternative; for the people of the <rs>South</rs> are not going to require anything that the <rs>North</rs> should not right fully yield.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The South does not want the <rs>North</rs> to do anything that is inconsistent with either Northern honor, true dignity or propriety. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> Of course the <name>Conventions</name> in <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName> and <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, which are the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> that the <placeName reg="New Jersey" key="tgn,7007565">New Jersey</placeName> <rs type="role2">Commissioner</rs> can now reach, will each leave in existence a commission, with power to make such modifications as to the details of their ultimatum as may be agreed upon by their sister States. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> There is no power but the people, in these Conventions assembled, that can say what will satisfy the <rs>South</rs>; and to settle the difficulty between the <num value="2">two</num> sections, without knowing this in plain and distinct terms, to be stated by the <rs>South</rs> herself, would be like attempting to negotiate between <num value="2">two</num> armies, without a proposition from either, or to settle a dispute between your neighbors without knowing what the aggrieved party had to complain of. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> Such, hastily sketched, are the general outlines of the plan which I understand, from sufficient authority, is now being discussed in <placeName reg="New Jersey" key="tgn,7007565">New Jersey</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>I go for any plan which will draw from the people of the <rs>South</rs> a statement of the terms and conditions upon which they will be content to remain in the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>This appears to be most simple, expeditions and direct, and <placeName reg="New Jersey" key="tgn,7007565">New Jersey</placeName> has it in her power to do more to save the <rs>Union</rs> than any State in it; and I, for <num value="1">one</num>, hope she will not be slow to avail herself of the glorious privilege. </p> <closer> <salute>In haste, but always<lb/>Yours, truly,</salute> <lb/> <signed><persName n="Maury,,M.,F.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="default:Maury,M.,F.,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <foreName>F.</foreName>  <surname>Maury</surname></persName>.</signed> </closer> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> <hi rend="italics">Follow-Citizens:</hi> I return you my sincere thanks for the very kind and cordial manner in which you are pleased to receive me. If there is anything calculated to sustain me in the critical and difficult situation which I am called upon to occupy, it is the consciousness that I am supported by a brave and patriotic people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>[Applause.] Allow me to say to you, fellow-citizens, that the <orgName n="South Carolina Convention" type="convention">Convention of South Carolina</orgName> has placed this State in a proud and a glorious position before the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>[Tremendous applause]. That Convention is now assembled, and, under existing circumstances, it would be obviously improper in me to make any lengthy or protracted remarks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>[Cries of &#x0022;Go on!&#x0022; &#x0022;Go on!&#x0022;] But, fellow-citizens, allow me to say to you that I hope and trust I am in possession of information that, perhaps, there may be no appeal to force on the part of the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities.--[Cheers.] But if I am mistaken in this, at least as far as I am concerned, we are prepared to meet any and every issue.--I hope and trust that under existing circumstances there will be no imprudence &mdash; no rash appeals to counsels caught under the impulse of false rumors; that we will prove to the world that we are not only free and independent, but that we are entitled to be so by our virtues and our character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The Convention, in all human probability, will, in a few days, send the <name>Ordinance</name> to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, which proclaims you to be, as you have a right to be, a free and independent Republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>[Applause.] And, until they present the claims of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> to your forts and your public places now in possession of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, it is our duty to sustain that Convention by showing that we are ready to await a free and fair demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>But if, in the meantime, there is any attempt to increase the forces that now garrison them, so far as I am concerned, it shall not be done without an appeal to arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>[Loud and prolonged cheering] </p> </q><bibl n="The Marsellaise"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> I sincerely desire that so far as am concerned, we shall triumphantly go through this great controversy without this appeal to arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>But, if it be necessary to vindicate the independence of my country, I vow to you here, that all the power that I have shall be exerted to maintain to the last extremity the independence of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>[Great applause]. Allow me to say that there is nothing at present, in the present issues, to excite the slightest alarm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Be firm, be united, be true to your country, and your country is safe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>I beg you to remember that it is not the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time in the history of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> that she has stood alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>On a memorable occasion she stood alone before even the <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>She fought &mdash; and triumphantly fought &mdash; the <rs n="Battle of Fort Moultrie" type="battle">battle of Fort Moultrie</rs>, before she was an independent State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>She fought it alone &mdash; she fought it upon her own resources and responsibility, and if needs be she can fight alone again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>[Applause.] I say to you, again on another memorable occasion, at the great battle of <placeName reg="Churubusco, Clinton, New York" key="tgn,2068513">Churubusco</placeName>, the glorious Palmetto Regiment was called upon for the most gallant charge in the history of that campaign, and when the New York and <orgName type="mil" key="PARegiment">Pennsylvania Regiments</orgName> failed to answer, and the <orgName type="mil" key="SCRegiment">South Carolina Regiment</orgName> was called upon, the gallant and glorious leader of that Regiment &mdash; his <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> in command, the brave and intrepid <persName n="Gladden,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Gladden,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Gladden</surname></persName>--marched across the field of <placeName reg="Churubusco, Clinton, New York" key="tgn,2068513">Churubusco</placeName> alone, to their immortal honor, and we can stand and march alone again.-- [Applause.] Fellow-citizens, I desire to say nothing that is imprudent or rash.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>I desire coolness and calmness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>I desire that every man shall be ready, standing at his post &mdash; ready to do his duty when the word is given to march.

<head>A Christmas story for the young.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/> My dear young friends, some of you may have read a beautiful story by a pious minister, about earth's angels; how day and night, week after week, and year after year, <num value="1">one</num> of the purest and brightest of the angels kneels ever before heaven, pouring tears of sorrow for the sins of men, and praying ever that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> will forgive them, and offering up his burning love and passionate tears to stone for our coldness and wickedness; and this angel sees so much sin and so little love upon earth, that he is always weeping most bitterly for the outraged honor of his dear <rs type="role2">Lord</rs> our Saviour, and lamenting the sins and sorrows of men.--All the angels in heaven have some particular province, that is, some particular work to do, and this is the work of this dear angel; and because he is always interceding for us, he is called earth's angel. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/> The tears of this dear angel form a bright limpid stream before the throne of the great <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, always pure and calm, but <num value="1">one</num> <dateStruct value="-12-24"><occasion>Christmas eve</occasion></dateStruct>, when all the happy angels in heaven were singing most beautiful hosannas, and the whole court of heaven were prostrate before the once Babe of <placeName reg="Bethlehem, Northampton, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7013416">Bethlehem</placeName>, this stream of the angel's tears was agitated, and its silvery sweetness was moved by little waves that sobbed and sighed mournfully; and dear St. Mary cast her sweet eyes upon the sad pleading waters, and she sent a bright messenger to inquire why earth's angel was so grieved on <dateStruct value="-12-24"><occasion>Christmas eve</occasion></dateStruct>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/> The dear angel said he grieved bitterly this night for the sorrows and miseries of little children; some were dying with hunger and cold, some poor little babies were dying un-baptized, and alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>for their little souls, others were growing older and learning to commit sin; the lips that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> made to love Him and praise Him were beginning to speak against him, to speak falsely and unkindly, and, oh!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>some to curse and swear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>The hands <name n="God" type="God">God</name> made to be raised in prayer and employed in good, kind deeds, were used in anger and in dishonesty, and, alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>the little heart <name n="God" type="God">God</name> made to serve Him, was learning to neglect Him and love His enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>Other children were good, but very miserable, and the dear angel's soul was sad on their account, and the tears dropped faster and faster into the overflowing stream. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/> Then St. Mary spoke to Him who had once been a little child, and she begged His mercy and compassion upon the suffering children of earth. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/> And <persName><foreName>Mary</foreName></persName>'s voice sounded through heaven clear and melodious, like the beautiful strings of a golden harp, or the sweet dreamy music of the wind on a summer's night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>When she ceased speaking there was silence in heaven, for the angels loved to hear the last echo as it softly died away. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/> Our <rs type="role2">Lord</rs> granted her prayer as soon as it was asked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>He always does so, dear children, and he took compassion upon some of the children and relieved their little sufferings, and then He sent an angel down to earth to bring the most miserable child he could find to heaven. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/> The angel bowed his bright head before his <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>, and hastened to obey his command.--The world was very fair, it wore its white robe of <persName n="Christmas,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00446" reg="mostcommon:Christmas,nomatch:0"><surname>Christmas</surname></persName> snow, but it looked dreary and dull, when compared with the beautiful golden heaven the angel left behind; and on his way he passed earth's angel, who gave him <num value="1">one</num> of his tears, and it was so large and bright that if he held the little finger on which he carried it near the heart of a child, he could see by its light all that was passing within. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/> He alighted in <num value="1">one</num> of the largest cities in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, because he knew there is always more misery in those great places than in small towns or villages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, the angel was almost bewildered by the busy crowds, as they hurried along the streets; for, under the rich dresses and poor rags, the warm clothing and thin, beauty covering, he could see the human hearts beating, and could read all their thoughts; and when he saw what was passing in the minds of some who were well to look at and fair to view, this dear angel sighed and turned away his beautiful head, and said, &#x0022;Alas!&#x0022; for the dear honor and wounded love of his blessed <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>He passed on through the light streets, filled with gay shop-windows, and thronged by busy men and women He came to some large, grand houses, all brilliantly lighted and full of festivity. &#x0022;I do not think I shall find a very miserable child here,&#x0022; said the angel, &#x0022;but I will go in and see&#x0022; So he went through a spacious hall, and up a large marble staircase, through magnificently furnished rooms, and he passed splendidly-dressed ladies on his way, until he came to the nursery &mdash; for every angel, when he enters a house, goes <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> where the children are. It was a large warm room, with a thick, soft carpet upon the floor, and crimson curtains to the window, which gave a rich, glowing color to the light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>No <num value="1">one</num> seemed to be in the room, until, looking in <num value="1">one</num> corner, he saw a little boy, about <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure> old, who had cried himself to sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>His toys were all laying about, as though he did not care for them; <num value="1">one</num> little hand grasped a small figure of a dog, <num value="2">two</num> great round tears lay upon his pretty cheeks, and every few minutes a deep sigh made his sweet lips tremble. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/> <measure n="3years" type="date">Three years</measure> ago this little boy had a dear mother, who loved him as all mothers love their children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>She used to nurse him and sing to him; and she had long golden curls that he used to play with; and every night she used to come and put his hands together, and teach him his prayers, and then draw the white curtains around his pretty bed, and kiss him many times over, and say, &#x0022;Good night.&#x0022; The little boy saw his mother's sweet face was very white <num value="1">one</num> night, and she kissed him so often that he wondered; and the next day she was ill, and after some time they carried him to her, where she lay so white and faint, that he was frightened, and began to cry, but she clasped him in her weak arms, and held him there until some <num value="1">one</num> gave a great cry, and the dear arms fell down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>And after that he never saw his mother again &mdash; they said she was gone to heaven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>Some time after, his father brought a new mamma home, but she was not like his own: she had dark hair, and such black eyes, and she did not seem to love him very much; so the little boy was very lonely: no <num value="1">one</num> came at night to kiss him or hear his prayers, only the nursemaid, and she was cross, and used to frighten him with foolish tales.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>And on <dateStruct value="-12-24"><occasion>Christmas eve</occasion></dateStruct> he sat and thought about his dear mother, with her sweet face and golden hair, until he cried himself to sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>The angel knelt by him, and saw by the light all that was passing in his breast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>It was not all sorrow; oh, no; for there was much love to cheer the boy for his mother in heaven, and while any <num value="1">one</num> who loves a mother in heaven he cannot be quite miserable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>So the angel blessed the pretty sleeper and left him. He then went down a narrow court, where the houses were so poor that you would think no <num value="1">one</num> could live in them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/>In the very poorest of these the angel went.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>The window was broken and stopped with rags, and the cold air came in; there was very little fire, only just a few dying embers, and no furniture but a heap of straw in <num value="1">one</num> corner, and <num value="1">one</num> old stool before the fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>By the light of the wretched candle the angel saw upon the heap of straw a child, fearfully ill, its face flushed and hot, and its eyes heavy and dull.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>On the stool sat a poor <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> woman cowering over the fire, trying in vain to get some heat or warmth from it. And every time the child moaned the mother crossed herself, as though otherwise she should despair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>And then the little weak voice said: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/> &#x0022;Oh, mother, give me some tea, I am burning with thirst.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/> &#x0022;I have not got it, darling,&#x0022; said the woman, with a passionate cry, as she fell upon her knees. &#x0022;I have nothing to give you but water.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/> Then the angel knelt and locked in the child's heart; poverty, cold, hunger, thirst, and sickness, had all tried their worst, and yet for that child there was a light in its darkness --In the midst of its pains and troubles it loved its mother, and had great pleasure in her tenderness and love. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/> &#x0022;The child is not quite miserable, I must go elsewhere,&#x0022; he said. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/> In another house, a little boy was pursing his little dying sister, and the poor mother was busy cleaning up the house for the doctor, and the little boy's tears fell hot and fast upon the pretty pale baby that he loved so dearly, and was so soon going to lose forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>But he was pleased, because he knew the dear, dying baby would soon be in heaven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>So the angel left him, and he looked up to the sky, where the stars were gleaming, and he heard the hosannas of the angels and the ripple of the stream of tears. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/> And while he was looking upwards he heard a sound of music near him,--it was a very old street organ, playing &#x0022;Adeste Fideles,&#x0022; (the <rs>Christmas Hymn</rs>) You would almost have smiled to hear how it groaned, and what labor and work it seemed to have to bring the tune out. The angel looked, and there was such a little boy, only about <measure n="8years" type="date">eight years</measure> old, turning the handle round and round.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>His face was pale with cold and hunger; his fair face was only half covered by an old cap; a thin dress did not half protect him from the sharp freezing cold; but still he turned on and on without stopping, for he had only <measure n="7d." type="currency"><num value="7">seven</num> pence</measure>, and he knew if he went home without a shilling he should get no supper, and perhaps worse than that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>All day long he had been in the streets playing over all his little tunes, and almost crying himself every time &#x0022;Adeste Fideles&#x0022; came around.--So many people passed him by; sometimes they stopped for a moment to look at him, and then his heart would beat high with hope, and he would eagerly watch their hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>Then they passed on, and the light would fade from his eyes, and &#x0022;his heart grow sad again.&#x0022;--Night came at last with its stars, and the snow was frozen, and the air blew keen and sharp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>The street lamps were lighted, and the gas in the show windows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>More and more people passed him by; they walked quickly because of the cold, and <sic>did did</sic> not stay to think of the poor little boy or his music.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>Still he turned round and round, and every now and then &#x0022;Adeste Fideles&#x0022; came in its turn.--None knew how the timid heart was shrinking from fear, or surely they would have given something from their abundance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>And as the night wore on, the hot, heavy tears fell down the pale face, and the tired arms almost refused to work. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/> &#x0022;Oh, mother,&#x0022; said the child, with a great sigh and sob, &#x0022;oh, if I might come to heaven to you.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/> Then the angel drew near; he held the light, and looked into the boy's heart. &#x0022;Ah!&#x0022; said he, when he saw what was there. &#x0022;but I will be sure <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/> Very slowly, very sadly the child turned his wearied footsteps home; lingering by the way, for he knew what would await him if he had not money enough, often staying to look in the shop windows, where the hot pies and cakes looked so tempting, and longing with all his hungry little heart for <num value="1">one</num>; then counting his money over and over again so carefully, hoping he might have made a mistake before, and turning all his pockets over to see if he had not <num value="0.5">one half</num>- penny left that he did not know of. No, there it all lay, only <measure n="7d." type="currency"><num value="7">seven</num> pence</measure>, and he had been all day in the cold and snow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>Wearily he lifted up his organ, and turned to go home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>Ah, me!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>what sad thoughts were in that poor little heart; how bitter were the tears that fell so fast; well might the angel fancy as he followed him, that he heard more distinctly and pitifully the ripple of the stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>While the child and the angel turn down streets and lanes and alleys, I will tell you who the boy was. His father and mother were poor <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italians</rs>, and many years ago they left their beautiful sunny land and came to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> to try to get their living.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>They only had this <num value="1">one</num> little boy, and he was called after the great and holy <placeName reg="Saint Bernard, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,2081723">St. Bernard</placeName>.--But he was so small and so pretty, with such fair hair and dark soft eyes, that he never went by any other name than Bernie.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>His mother died when he was very young, and left him to his father.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>And his dear kind father was everything to him. He amused him and played with him, and when Bernie was tired, he would take him in his arms, and sing songs of the beautiful <rs>Italy</rs> to him. Every morning the father used to go out with his organ and come home again in the evening, and the old woman where he lodged used to take care of Bernie.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>All day he was so quiet and good, and when evening was coming he would stand near the street door and watch for his father, and when he saw him would run to meet him, and the poor father would often go without butter to his bread, or sugar to his tea, so as to be able to bring his little boy a nice cake or a bun home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>Then Bernie's bright eyes would sparkle, and he would clap his hands for joy. Ab, I cannot tell you how passionately the father loved this little boy, and he, poor child, had no <num value="1">one</num> else to love; no <num value="1">one</num> else ever spoke a kind word to him; so all his heart was fixed upon his dear father. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/> <num value="1">One</num> cold winter poor Bernie's father was taken very ill, and could not go out with his organ.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>He grew worse and worse, and the doctor and the priest both came, and said he could never get any better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/><num value="1">One</num> day when he was alone with the boy, he called him to the bedside and said--&#x0022;My dear Bernie, my poor boy, have they told you I am going?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/> &#x0022;Going where, father!&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/> &#x0022;To heaven, I hope, my child.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/> &#x0022;Oh, yes, they told me, but I did not mind, because I knew you would never go anywhere without me. You will take me, too, won't you?&#x0022; and he fixed his eyes eagerly upon his father's face. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/> But the father could not answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>How could he tell the lonely little boy that he would leave him forever, and that he would be alone in the wide world without <num value="1">one</num> to love or care for him. He could only take him in his arms, and hold him to the heart so soon to be stilled for ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>The child felt his father's burning face and hands growing colder. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/> &#x0022;Bernie!&#x0022; &#x0022;Bernie!&#x0022; he said, groping with his hand as though in darkness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/> &#x0022;I am here, father,&#x0022; said the boy, wondering. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/> Once, oh, yet once more, such is the power of love, the dying arms clasped him once again, and for the last time those loving lips kissed the boy's fair brow, and then, oh, then, the dear hands grew colder, and an awful stillness fell upon the white face. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/> &#x0022;Father, father!&#x0022; cried the child, in wild terror. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/> No answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>For the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time the dear voice was silent to his cry; and when the priest came he found Bernie senseless from grief and fear, still clasping his dead father's hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>And the doctor said it was the great and sudden emotion at the child's question, of which Bernie told him, that had snapped the slender thread of the poor father's life. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/> Poor, poor Bernie, they took his father, away, and laid him in the cold ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>And he used to go every day to cry by his grave.--And sometimes he would lay his little head down upon the grass, and say so pitifully, &#x0022;Oh, father, please let me come to Heaven.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/> Some people wanted Bernie to go to the workhouse; they said it was the proper place for such children as he. But the old woman where he lodged, said &#x0022;No, if he will give me a shilling a-week, I will keep him, for he can go out with his organ.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/> So that was settled, and <num value="1">one</num> bright summer's morning they put his poor lost father's organ in his hands, and sent him out to play.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> it was a novelty to see such a little boy out playing, that people used to be very generous and pleased to give him a penny.--Then when they were quite used to it, they would pass him by without giving him anything. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/> The old woman, whose name was Bessy, was not cruel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>She rather liked Bernie, and would have been very kind to him if she had lived alone, but she had <num value="2">two</num> big idle sons, who were very bad men, and who led the poor child a miserable life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>They used to send him out in the morning with a bit of bread, to last him the whole day. And then they made a cruel rule that if he came home with less than a shilling, he should have no supper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>Oh, my dear children, think of what that boy suffered from hunger; think how he must have trembled all day, for fear he should not have money enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>So he went on for some time, and at last came <dateStruct value="-12-24"><occasion>Christmas Eve</occasion></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>He cried when he <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> got up in the morning, for he remembered how last <dateStruct value="-12-24"><occasion>Christmas Eve</occasion></dateStruct> his dear father had hurried home with a beautiful orange, and some warm pies, and had kissed him, and said, &#x0022;Here is your <persName n="Christmas,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00447" reg="mostcommon:Christmas,nomatch:0"><surname>Christmas</surname></persName> feast, Bernie.&#x0022; Alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>this <dateStruct value="-12-24"><occasion>Christmas Eve</occasion></dateStruct> no <num value="1">one</num> thought about him, or cared whether he lived or died, and he looked upon the snow, and then up to the stars, and asked, &#x0022;Our Father who art in Heaven,&#x0022; to take him home. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/> The angel and the child went through a great part of the city until they came to the house where he lived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>How his poor little heart beat with fear as he opened the door quietly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/> &#x0022;Well,&#x0022; said a gruff voice, &#x0022;and what have you got, young <num value="1">one</num>?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/> &#x0022;Only <measure n="7d." type="currency"><num value="7">seven</num> pence</measure>,&#x0022; said Bernie, trembling in every limb. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/> And well he might; for a heavy hand struck a severe blow upon his little defenceless head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>Ah, me!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>the same dear head that lay years ago upon his mother's heart, and lately upon his dead father's heart. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/> &#x0022;Oh, please don't beat me; I am very sorry, but I could not help it; no <num value="1">one</num> would give me anything.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/> &#x0022;Because you never asked,&#x0022; said the man, with another blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>Now, go up stairs, and remember, you have no supper; you do not earn your salt; go along, sir.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/> Very slowly the little fellow turned to go away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>The man was having a nice supper of hot meat, that smelt so savory and so tempting that it made the poor child more hungry than ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/>It was hissing and frying in a pan over <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> the fire, and how good it looked to his eager eyes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/> &#x0022;Oh, I am so hungry, and it's <dateStruct value="-12-24"><occasion>Christmas Eve</occasion></dateStruct>; might I have a bit of supper, please,&#x0022; he said, trembling, and timidly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/> &#x0022;I'll <dateStruct value="-12-24"><occasion>Christmas Eve</occasion></dateStruct> you, if you talk that nonsense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/>If you don't earn supper, you can't have it. Go up stairs.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/> So meekly and quietly he went, with such a look of hunger in his pale face, that the man's heart must have been harder than iron: as it was, when he returned to his comfortable supper after driving Bernie up to his garret, he seemed to try to satisfy his own conscience by saying-- </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/> &#x0022;Those boys are so idle, <num value="1">one</num> must be sharp with them.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/> &#x0022;You need not starve him, if you are sharp,&#x0022; said the mother, &#x0022;he looks bad enough now, without sending him hungry and cold to bed.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/> But the man went on eating, and the old woman durst not offer to take the child anything while he was about. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/> Wearily, wearily the poor boy mounted the steep stairs, until he came to his room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>And what a room it was, so cold, and so dirty, with a small iron bedstead, and a straw mattress with <num value="1">one</num> blanket, nothing else, not even a chair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>Bernie put his dear organ safe in <num value="1">one</num> corner of the room, said his prayers, and then lay down, faint and hungry and cold, on his miserable bed. Then, when he was quite alone, and he durst cry, he hid his little face in the blanket and cried, oh, such tears!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>Even there he could smell the nice supper below, and every time the door opened he thought Bessy was coming to bring him some, but she never came; and then his poor heart sank again. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/> Ah, well might the angel think he heard the ripple of the stream louder and more pitiful than ever. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/> A strange feeling came over Bernie, his head seemed to be lighter and yet all on fire, his hands were burning hot, and his eyes so heavy he could not keep them open, and every limb ached as though he had been tearfully beaten. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/> &#x0022;Oh, father, <rs type="role" n="Father">father</rs>,&#x0022; cried the lonely child, &#x0022;do come to me, or else fetch me to Heaven; do you know how ill and hungry I am?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/> The angel could bear it no longer, he drew near and held the light close to Bernie's heart; there could not be a more miserable child.--Nothing could be worse than this; poor, lonely, cold, hungry, alone, and no <num value="1">one</num> to love him or care for him; no <num value="1">one</num> even to speak a kind word to him; no <num value="1">one</num> had ever kissed him since his father died. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/> The angel came nearer, he knelt by the bedside for a moment, and then stood by Bernie; he laid his cool, soft hand upon his hot brow and flushed face; the boy opened his eyes, and there, in place of the cold, dirty room, he saw a most beautiful angel, with a bright, sweet face, and kind, loving eyes, and soft white wings; and upon <num value="1">one</num> finger there was something that looked like a large diamond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>Bernie was not afraid; no &mdash; those were the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> eyes that looked kindly on him for so long. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/> &#x0022;Bernie,&#x0022; said the angel, in a sweet, low voice, &#x0022;my poor little boy, you are very miserable&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/> &#x0022;I am, dear angel, the most miserable child in the world.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/> &#x0022;I am come to help you, Bernie.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/> &#x0022;Oh, angel, will you help me?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/>Oh, then, please do take me to my father.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/> &#x0022;I will take you to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and your father, too; and you shall see your dear mother again, Bernie.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/> &#x0022;Thank you, dear angel, now I am happy.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/> Then the angel took Bernie's hands, and folded them in his own; he breathed upon his face, and he felt no more cold or heat; he only saw the golden glory round the angel's head, and heard a faint distant sound of music; and something seemed floating through the room like fragrant incense. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/> &#x0022;Say, &#x0027;Our Father,&#x0027; Bernie.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/> &#x0022;Now say after me--&#x0027;Dear <persName><foreName>Jesus</foreName></persName>, who wert once a child, like me, take pity upon me, for I have known cold and misery, and hunger and thirst, and loneliness and sorrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>I am sorry with all my heart, for all my many sins; I repent most bitterly of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>I wish I had been a better boy. I offer to Thee all my troubles; and I beg of Thee, dear <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>, if it be Thy will, to let me come home to Thee.&#x0027;--Are you willing to die, dear Bernie?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/> &#x0022;Yes; I am very willing.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/> &#x0022;You wish to go to Heaven?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/> &#x0022;Yes; with all my heart.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/> &#x0022;But if <name n="God" type="God">God</name> willed for you to live much longer, and to suffer much more, would you be as willing?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/> &#x0022;Yes; for the love of Him, dear angel.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/> Then the angel drew nearer, and he laid <placeName reg="Bernie's head">Bernie's head</placeName> upon his kind heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>Whether he lay there moments or hours, the boy never knew; he only saw the glory bright, and the music sweeter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>He felt no pain, no care, only a dreamy longing to see something more glorious than he saw there. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/> Then the glory became so dazzling and bright, he could no longer bear it; and then the music, so sweet and near, he could distinguish the word &#x0022;Hosanna.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/> &#x0022;Close your eyes, Bernie,&#x0022; said the angel. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/> He did so; the angel gently pressed his hand upon them, something fluttered at Bernie's heart and on his lips, the light and music ascended, and the boy and the angel, together joined the &#x0022;Hosanna&#x0022; in Heaven. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/> There was a great sensation on the morrow, when the child was found dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>They held an inquest, but the doctors could scarcely agree as to how he died, or what was his disease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>But they all wondered at the fair, marble face, with its angelical smile, and the white hands crossed upon the little heart. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/> The poor old woman cried very much, and was very grieved for little Bernie; and the cruel man never forgot that pitiful pleading voice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/> Dear young friends, perhaps you think such tales are scarcely true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/>When you are older and can read the papers, you will see stranger things than these; cruelty to little helpless children is not rare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>Will you little ones do all you can to atone for it, particularly this happy Christmas time, when you have such abundance of good things and kind friends?--Think of the poor and the helpless, and give something to comfort and cheer them. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
