<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>In discussing this subject, on which men so warmly and so widely differed, he proposed to deal with facts without obtruding opinions or hazarding predictions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>He was well aware that he ran the risk of giving sectional offence in speaking on a question which <num value="20000000">twenty millions</num> on the <num value="1">one</num> side and <num value="10000000">ten millions</num> on the other were disputing at the point of the bayonet, and which rendered every drawing room a forum and every bar-room a battle field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>On that he had little to say &mdash; it was a question on which the greatest statesmen differed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>It was enough to say that the <rs>South</rs> had a religious belief in it, and most assuredly they had proved their faith by their acts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>The causes of disunion extended far back, reaching even beyond the foundation of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>In the first place the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> system was an incongruous system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>The universe itself could not remain entire with <num value="2">two</num> supreme powers at the head, and how could <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> with her <num value="74">seventy-four</num> sovereignties?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> movement of the practical assertion claimed by the <rs>South</rs> was the taking of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, in the harbor of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 4" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName>, and the voluntary union was disseized whilst the new doctrine of coercion was proclaimed at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>; and that new doctrine was now preached by Federal cannon and Federal bayonets. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/> The cause of secession dated far beyond the union of the old <num value="13">thirteen</num> States--beyond even the doctrine of self-government laid down in the cabin of the <rs>Mayflower</rs>, and signed by <num value="30">thirty</num> fugitive Pilgrims.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>Abolitionism caused the war &mdash; secessionism precipitated it. The peculiar form of abolitionism was political, not social.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>It was the free-soil party, and not the philanthropists of <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> and <placeName reg="Exeter Hall">Exeter Hall</placeName>, which had driven on secession. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>Sentimental abolitionism had very few advocates in the <rs>Congress</rs> and none in the <rs>Cabinet</rs> <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> wanted the manufactures of <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> duty free, and desired to pay for them in her own cotton, without having it clipped at New York on its way to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Manchester</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>Antagonism ripened into hatred, and the result was open war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>On the other hand, they showed a Sporran determination to spend their last dollar, and to shed their last drop of blood to resist invasion, and even the women stripped themselves of their jewels to equip the army of their defenders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>In some regiments it was not unusual to see <num value="3">three</num> generations, grandfather, father and son of the oldest families; and, perhaps, no army ever went into the field with so large a proportion of well educated and wealthy gentlemen. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/> Men like these went into battle as if they were entering on single combat; and perhaps no truer conception of the state of feeling in the <rs>South</rs> could be gained than from the words, <q>&#x0022;the spirit it of resistance is up to the duelling point.&#x0022;</q> Women, priests and bishops were enlisted in the cause, and even the slaves asked permission of their masters to go and fight the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> abolitionists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>It was no question of race, blood or religion on that divided them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>Let him now refer to the elements of the different armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>In the <rs>North</rs> there was a manufacturing and a trading people; the <rs>South</rs> was peculiarly agricultural.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>In consequence of emigration the population of the <rs>North</rs> embraced every nation, tribe and people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/> There were there swarms of convicts, paupers, and refugees, and there the right of free suffrage gave a power which was a dangerous element in the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>Unrestricted suffrage was the fallacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>When Pontins Pilate gave the franchise to the people they elected Barabas, and from that day to this there were <num value="1000">thousands</num> of instances to disprove the popular dogma that <q>&#x0022;the voice of the people is the voice of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.&#x0022;</q> The seceded States were comparatively free from the admixture of foreigners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>The Constitution of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> as granted was far superior to that of the <rs>Federal States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>It was particularly so in <num value="2">two</num> respects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/> Thus there was a check on office-seeking, and on the clamorous hounds for place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>By this system of place hunting the <rs>North</rs> had become a nation of politicians without a statesman being left, and thus it became worse than was conveyed in the description of the <rs n="Frenchman" type="propernoun">Frenchman</rs> who, having visited the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, exclaimed, <q>&#x0022;My <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, what a country--<num value="250">250</num> religious and only <num value="1">one</num> soup&#x0022;</q>--(laughter)--to which a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> journalist retorted on <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName> by saying, <q>&#x0022;My <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, what a nation--<num value="250">250</num> soups and no religion.&#x0022;</q> (Renewed laughter.)

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>Those who have anything to dispose of, and who can realize it, are investing the processes in gold or in foreign exchanges, so as to be prepared for what seems inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>It is evident that, unless Congress acts speedily and energetically, not only will we be overtaken by a financial revulsion, severer than any we have as yet encountered, but the credit of the <rs>Government</rs> will be destroyed, and our army, which is being brought into such fine condition, utterly demoralized.

<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/> --We are sorry to learn that a project has been introduced into Congress for establishing a military censorship of the press in the <rs>Southern States The</rs> arguments by which so pernicious a measure is supported are of course, the same that have been employed by arbitrary power in its resistance of liberal principles through all ages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>It seems that these arguments have been sufficient for accomplishing the purposes of despotism in the <rs>North</rs>--the same <rs>North</rs> where freedom of speech, of the pen, <unclear></unclear> the person are alike overthrown, and the <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Justice">Chief Justice</rs> himself is as powerless to vindicate the liberties <unclear></unclear> by the <rs>Constitution</rs> as a <unclear></unclear> It <unclear></unclear> too, that there are a few in the <rs>South</rs> with whom these same arguments have prevailed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/> It would insult the intelligence of the <rs>Southern</rs> people to examine and to expose them is detail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>They are too shallow and flimsy to deserve such pains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>The presence is that the press gives information of the movements of our armies and the schemes of our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, and that, therefore, this bulwark of popular liberty, this terror to evil doers, this gorgon dire to military martinets and despots, must be put under the collar, and that the chain must be handed to those very military officials from whom the greatest corruptions <unclear></unclear> abuses, and the greatest danger to liberty to this juncture, are naturally to be apprehended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>When all authority, all power, and all control of the persons and the treasure of the people are in the hands of the military class, is this the time to strike down the only protection the people have left against their authority, and the only weapon of assault they possess against the abases which are so apt sooner or later, to creep into their transactions? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/> The public ear is already full of rumored impending the frugality, if not the integrity, of officers connected with military departments of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>We believe that these rumors are in most of the cases exaggerated, and that a full knowledge of facts would show as upright an administration of affairs as the history of any war affords; but much of the integrity that marks the conduce of the war is due to the fact that the people's press is free and at liberty to speak out on there suspicion of peculation of abuse. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/> The only circumstance that has staggered our belief in the purity prevailing in the management of this war, is this recent effort from the outside to prevail upon Congress, under the specious pretense of military expediency, to establish a military censorship of the press.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>To deny to the press its right of speaking on army movements, on the number of troops in this and that quarter, and on the strategic policy or designed of the military authorities, is to strike down at <num value="1">one</num> blow its liberty to speak of army affairs at all. The particular time at which this proposition is made constitutes a very strong objection to the measure; for when the people are beginning to inquire into the numerous allegations of abuse that beset their ears, it is not meet to deprive them of their month piece and organ. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/> Better that the enemy should know all our military movements and plans than that the wholesome dread of exposure through the public journals should cease to keep in the paths of integrity and purity the business agents of our armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>The South could much better afford the loss of many battles than a loss of confidence in the honesty of her public servants, in a great straggle like the present. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/> The clamor of a few military persons against the press for its outspeakings on the movements and transactions of our <unclear></unclear> is quite puerile and senseless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>The enemy's general would be very weak indeed if they shaped their measures by the revelations of the <rs>Southern</rs> press.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>They have sources of information abundantly more expeditions and accurate than our newspapers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/><persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00154" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName> has a corps of hired spice dogging at the heels of our citizens even in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>Can any <num value="1">one</num> believe that the <rs>South</rs> is not also filled with his emissaries?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>Northern journals seem to derive information from the departments of our Government in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> which our own press have no means of obtaining.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>Are we to be fined and imprisoned for copying complete lists of our military <hi rend="italics">personal</hi> from the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>At a time when <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="200">two hundred</num> persons are going off to the <rs>North</rs> every week, (many bearing passports,) after exercising the largest liberty of observation while here, is it to be charged to the <rs>Southern</rs> press that the enemy is in full possession of all that occurs amongst us?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>The practices and expedients of despotism might indeed be wholesomely applied, at this time, to the real conveyors of information to the enemy; but it would be as unwise to lay the hand of despotism upon the sacred person of the press, as it would be unjust to make of it a scapegrace for the sins of a much more reprehensible set of men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/> The press have exhibited a commendable prudence throughout the war on this very subject of publishing intelligence to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>No man can point to a single catastrophe that has resulted from its revelations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>It has often been unjustly accused; but the sequel has shown in every case the injustice, and has vindicated it from the aspersions of its critics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>It was charged that the arrest of our Ministers on the <q>&#x0022;Treat&#x0022;</q> was in consequence of newspaper revelations of their debarkation; yet it is a fact that, though the press of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> knew of the departure of these gentlemen on the day they left this city, and, by request put out the decoy information that they were expected to go by way of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, their real exit from <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 4" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Charleston</placeName> was not divulged by it until they had reached <placeName reg="La Habana, Ciudad de la Habana, Cuba" key="tgn,7006453">Havana</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>On arriving in that neutral city, they, themselves, very properly threw off all disguise, and chose to go about openly in their true characters, rather than skulk, as if they had been infamous outlaws, in holes and corners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>The day of their intended sailing was known to everybody in <placeName reg="La Habana, Ciudad de la Habana, Cuba" key="tgn,7006453">Havana</placeName>, including the <orgName n="U. S. Consul" type="org">United States Consul</orgName> and the <rs>Federal</rs> naval officers in those waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>The Southern press did not know of their departure from <placeName reg="La Habana, Ciudad de la Habana, Cuba" key="tgn,7006453">Havana</placeName> until they were brought into <placeName key="tgn,2374406" n="1.000 34" reg="hampton roads, hampton, virginia">Hampton Roads</placeName> prisoners of <persName n="Wilkes,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00155" reg="mostcommon:Wilkes,nomatch:0"><surname>Wilkes</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>So much for this aspersion upon the press. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/> We were censured, by some persons ignorant of facts, the other day, for declaring that the enemy would burn <placeName reg="New River, West Virginia, West Virginia" key="tgn,1125392">New river</placeName> bridge, and blow up the <rs>Allegheny</rs> tunnel, if the <orgName n="Virginia and Tennessee Railroad" type="railroad">Virginia and Tennessee railroad</orgName> were left longer without protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>A dozen <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have been passing over that bridge, and through that tunnel, every week since the war commenced; and it is no news, <hi rend="italics">to them</hi> at least, that such a bridge and such a tunnel exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>So far from our paragraph having conveyed to the enemy in <placeName reg="Fayette, Kentucky, United States" key="tgn,1002371">Fayette county</placeName> the knowledge that there was such a railroad, having such a bridge and such a tunnel, we have reason to believe that they were much vexed and chagrined that <hi rend="italics">we informed our military authorities down here of the danger, before</hi> they were ready to strike the blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>In this case, at least, we conveyed valuable information against the schemes of the enemy, and not in their favor.
