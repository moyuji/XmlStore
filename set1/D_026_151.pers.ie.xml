<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The city was somewhat excited yesterday morning by a report that a general engagement was going on in front of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, and the sound of distant cannon, rapidly discharged, being distinctly heard in elevated positions, the report was generally believed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>As the day advanced, however, the press dispatches announced that nothing unusual was in progress, and our community became again quiet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The general belief now is that if a great battle takes place shortly it will be brought on by our troops making the attack; for it seems to be <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Gen,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s policy to <unclear></unclear> hard fighting for the present, while he resorts to the expedient of making <unclear></unclear> upon our railroads, and thus embarrassing transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>All the contests that have thus far taken place have proved that his troops are no match for the <rs>Confederates</rs> in valor, and their conduct shows that they are tired of &#x0022;butting against the rebel <unclear></unclear>&#x0022; They are content to dig dirt, in employment which suits them better than fighting, and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> lines in <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName></persName> will doubtless be protected by formidable fortifications, as they were in <placeName reg="Hanover, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2112147">Hanover</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The enemy having secured a lodgment on the <orgName n="Petersburg and Weldon Railroad" type="railroad">Petersburg and Weldon railroad</orgName>, proceeded to fortify as usual but they were not to be permitted to remain quietly in that position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>An attack was made upon them in <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, and after a sharp fight they were driven off, and some <num value="500">five hundred</num> of the blue rascals captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Our loss in this affair is represented to have been inconsiderable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>This handsome exploit <unclear>re </unclear> much credit upon the troops engaged. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> loss in the engagement of <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time> is estimated by competent, judges at something over <num value="4000">four thousand</num> in killed, wounded and prisoners; while our own, at the outside, did not exceed <num value="400">four hundred</num>, and some think <num value="300">three hundred</num> will cover the entire casualties. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> Events succeed each other in such rapid succession that a correspondent has no leisure, and little time to do more than merely chronicle results, without indulging speculations or entering much into details. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> Yesterday afternoon <persName n="Mahone,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Mahone,Gen,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Mahone</surname></persName>, who is <unclear></unclear> when work is to be done, was <unclear></unclear> by the &#x0022;cavalry people&#x0022; that the enemy, in strong force, had reached the <orgName n="Weldon Railroad" type="railroad">weldon railway</orgName>, <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure> below here, were <unclear></unclear> fortifying, and were spreading in every direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>This of course was behaved to be greatly exaggerated, if not entirely romantic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/><rs type="role">Gen.</rs> M., however, at once moved with his division, by order of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Lee,W.,F.,H.,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> and came up with the &#x0022;large force,&#x0022; which was engaged in the occupation of destroying the railroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>They proved to be cavalry, and fled at our approach, having destroyed about <measure n="150yards" type="distance">one hundred and fifty yards</measure> of the track, which will be repaired to day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> <rs type="role">Gen.</rs> M., however, did not stop here, but pushed forward, and about nightfall succeeded in overtaking a part of the <orgName type="corps" n="corps 6">sixth corps</orgName>, and captured about <measure n="480" type="prisoners">four hundred and eighty prisoners</measure>, including <num value="20">twenty</num> commissioned officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Our loss was quite small.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The affair was only a brilliant surprise, and our captures were made after a sharp but decisive skirmish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The enemy being surprised, their chief loss was in prisoners. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> Among the missing on our side during the fight on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time> was <persName n="Mills,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Mills,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Mills</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>His friends are very certain that he was captured, and not killed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> Last night about <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time> there was heavy firing, but it amounted to little or nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>A woman was killed by a shell thrown in the city on yesterday evening.--Very few shells have been thrown into the city to-day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> Advices from <placeName key="tgn,2037994" n="1.000 4" reg="burkesville, cumberland, kentucky">Burkesville</placeName> are to the effect that the enemy burnt it last night, about <time value="1oclock">one o'clock</time>. The high bridge is safe, and will not he destroyed I am quite sure. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> This morning about sunrise our batteries on the <rs>Chesterfield</rs> side of the <rs>Appomattox</rs>, opened a furious cannonade on the enemy's lines near <orgName type="battery" n="battery 5">battery No. 5</orgName>, on the <placeName key="tgn,2240477" n="1.000 1473" reg="city point, virginia, virginia">City Point</placeName> road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>After the cannonading had lasted about <measure n="30minutes" type="date">thirty minutes</measure>, <persName n="Haygood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Haygood,nomatch:0"><surname>Haygood</surname></persName>'s <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>They charged the enemy's skirmishers and drove them back, capturing some <num value="30">thirty</num> of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Their line of battle, however, was too strong for us, and so our troops had to retire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Our loss is not over <num value="60">sixty</num> in killed and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>We also lost, I think, a few prisoners, and captured about <num value="100">one hundred</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Since then nothing has been done. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>As we have heretofore announced, they left the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct>, and proceeded in the direction of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>It was subsequently ascertained that they struck the <rs>Chickahominy</rs> at <placeName reg="Porge Bridge">Porge Bridge</placeName>, and crossed to the south bank of that stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Our cavalry engaged them on Thursday on the <placeName reg="Charles City river">Charles City river</placeName> road, and <num value="1">one</num> account says they were forced back some distance by <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Chambliss,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Chambliss,nomatch:0"><surname>Chambliss</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>It is reported that another engagement took place on the same day, and that our troops, running short of ammunition, were compelled to fall back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>His expedition has been a series of disasters from beginning to end, and the command which started out from <orgName n="army"><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Gen,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> so fresh and lively, and with such high expectations, returns discomfited, broken down, and greatly depleted in men and horses. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> At a late hour last night it was reported that a courier had arrived with intelligence that our troops had an encounter with <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,nomatch:0"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName>'s forces yesterday, in which the latter were severely punished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>It is proper to add that we place very little confidence in stories brought by couriers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>There was no information at headquarters last night from this or any other point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>The only additional report we have is connected with the fight on <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>The idea has arisen that this vote might induce the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to adopt towards us a new attitude, of such a nature as to affect the cordial feelings existing between the <num value="2">two</num> countries, or, at any rate, to complicate the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> question by embarrassments arising from without.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>We need only, however, observe the circumstances under which the manifestation alluded to took place to understand that the vote is very far from possessing the importance imputed to it. It is doubtless the reflection of the feeling so carefully fostered by the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> press in the U States, which leads that people to consider as an indirect attack upon their rights the most legitimate intervention of a <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> Power, on any point of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> continent.
