<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The hostile armies have so strongly entrenched themselves and fortified their positions that it would seem sheer madness for either to attack the other in front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The amount of felled timber <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">cheraur de frise,</hi></foreign> stumps, ditches and embankments, that either would have to travel over in making an assault, appears sufficient to make it an absolutely hopeless undertaking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/> It is well known that, for some time past, the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> has been selling stooks, to an enormous amount, in <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, and that by the proceeds of these sales alone they have been enabled to sustain their finances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>Sales, it is believed, to the extent of <num value="80">eighty</num> or <num value="100000000">one hundred millions</num> of pounds sterling have thus been effected, the <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> purchasers being attracted by the low prices, and placing implicit faith in the solvency of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>If the purchasers were the only persons to suffer it would be a matter of great indifference to us whether they were swindled or not; or rather, we should say, we should be pleased to hear that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had cheated them out of every dollar and sent them all in a body to the dogs or the aims-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>Men who, for mercenary considerations, lend their funds to the support of a war against the liberties of a free people, deserve something worse than it is possible to give them this side of the grave, let alone the loss of worldly substance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>But unfortunately they are not the only persons who are to be injured by the transaction, for their funds furnish the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> with the means, and the only means, of carrying on the war upon us. Risk in financial affairs is always proportionate to profit, and he who lends his money out at double interest stands a double chance of losing both principal and interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>This principle is so simple, and so well ascertained, that it is surprising it never occurred to these <rs n="German" type="group">Germans</rs> when they were buying <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> stocks at a discount of <num value="50">fifty</num> and <num value="75">seventy-five</num> <hi rend="italics">per cent.</hi> It did not, however; and the trade continuing as brisk as ever, the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs> for the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, <persName n="Benjamin,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00239" reg="mostcommon:Benjamin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Benjamin</surname></persName>, in a dispatch to <persName n="Mann,Mister,A.,Dudley,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00240" reg="default:Mann,A.,Dudley,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>Dudley</foreName> <surname>Mann</surname></persName>, Confederate agent at <placeName key="tgn,7007868" n="1.000 1" reg="bruxelles,bruxelles,belgie,europe">Brussels</placeName>, undertakes to enlighten them by an analysis of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> financial condition derived from the statements of their own <orgName n="Treasury Department" type="department">Treasury Department</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>It is remarkably clear, comprehensive and pointed, and, if translated into <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> and widely circulated, cannot, we should think, fail to startle the <rs>Teutonic</rs> race. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/> It appears from the statements of the <orgName n="U. S. Treasury" type="org">United States Treasury</orgName> Department that the interest on the public debt, on the <date value="09-30">30th of September</date> last, was <measure n="81778648dollars" type="currency">$81,778,648</measure>, exceeding by rather more than <num value="5000000">five millions</num> the whole revenue of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, when they were all in the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>That revenue at that time was but <measure n="76752088dollars" type="currency">$76,752,088</measure>. The tables of the <orgName n="U. S. Treasury" type="org">United States Treasury</orgName> Department show that this debt is at this moment increasing at the rate of <measure n="2215000dollars" type="currency">$2,215,000</measure> <hi rend="italics">per diem,</hi> having attained that rate from <measure n="1962000dollars" type="currency">$1,962,000</measure> <hi rend="italics">per diem</hi> in the course of <measure n="200days" type="date">two hundred days</measure>, and that the rate of increase in still advancing, the whole increase having been upon the interest-basing debt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>The rate of interest on money now borrowed varies from <num value="0.06">six per cent</num> in gold to <num value="7">seven</num> and <num value="3">three</num>- <num value=".1">tenths</num> in paper, and none is borrowed for less than <num value="0.06">six per cent.</num> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/> If the present war continue, the public debt of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> will, in the next <measure n="212days" type="date">two hundred and twelve days</measure>, dating from the <dateStruct value="-09-1"><day reg="1">first</day> of <month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct> just passed and ending on the <dateStruct value="-05-1"><day reg="1">first</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> next &mdash; when active campaigning commences &mdash; have been increased by the addition of <measure n="477000000dollars" type="currency">$477,000,000</measure>. The campaign will then commence with a debt upon the shoulders of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> of, in round numbers, <measure n="2500000dollars" type="currency">$2,500,000</measure>, <num value="000">000</num>, and an interest of <measure n="113000000dollars" type="currency">$113,000,000</measure>. To this, add the pension list of the army and navy, to which the faith of the <rs>Government</rs> is pledged as sacredly as it is to the payment of interest upon any debt whatever, and it is a moderate calculation to say that <measure n="120000000dollars" type="currency">$120,000,000</measure> will cover it all. The appropriations made last <dateStruct value="-04-"><month reg="04">April</month></dateStruct> to pay the annual interest on the debt of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> was but <measure n="128000000dollars" type="currency">$128,000,000</measure>, although her debt has been accumulating for centuries, whereas this debt has been contracted in <measure n="3.5years" type="date">three years and a half</measure>. To the public debt of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> should properly be added the public debts of the several States still denominated loyal, which amounts to <measure n="200000000dollars" type="currency">$200,000,000</measure>, and, at an average of <num value="0.065">6&#x00BD; per cent.</num>, yields a further sum of <measure n="18000000dollars" type="currency">$18,000,000</measure>; so that, on the <dateStruct value="-05-1"><day reg="1">first</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> next, the entire interest will exceed that of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> by <measure n="10000000dollars" type="currency">$10,000,000</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/> Besides the money raised in this way, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have laid the heaviest taxes of which there is any account; and so far from appropriating any of the money, they spend it as fast as it comes to hand in prosecuting the war. <persName n="Fessenden,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00241" reg="mostcommon:Fessenden,nomatch:0"><surname>Fessenden</surname></persName> says the taxation is calculated to produce a <num value="1000000">million</num> a day, or <num value="365000000">three hundred and sixty-five millions</num> a year, thus exceeding the entire revenue of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> for the last year by more than <num value="30000000">thirty millions</num> of dollars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>Now, while the revenue of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> is collected from a population of <num value="30000000">thirty millions</num>, that of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> is collected from a population rated by themselves at <num value="23000000">twenty-three millions</num>, but certainly not so numerous by several <num value="1000000">millions</num> in point of fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>To this must be added the taxation of the several States, which is already enormously heavy everywhere, and promises to be heavier still.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>It must be apparent to the most casual observer that the utmost limit of taxation has already been reached, while it is certain that the war cannot be conducted further without adding at least <num value="2000000.25">two millions and a quarter</num> <hi rend="italics">per diem</hi> and probably a much larger sum. How these <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> gentlemen are to get their money is their lookout.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/><persName n="Benjamin,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00242" reg="mostcommon:Benjamin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Benjamin</surname></persName> does not think their prospects very bright, if we may judge from the <num value="2">two</num> subjoined paragraphs: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/> &#x0022;The facts thus presented demonstrate that, if the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> persist, as is now threatened, in carrying on the war for another year, the burthen of their public debt will be such as to render it absolutely impossible for them to pay, even if actuated, with entire unanimity, by a sincere desire to meet their obligations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>It may be left to others to speculate on the probability of such unanimity, but it is certain that <num value="3">three</num> of the largest, States have already repudiated, in part, their public debt by refusing to pay in coin the interest due in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, thus confiscating <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of the amount due to the <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> bond-holders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>The possibility of paying the debt already incurred is dependent solely upon a prompt cessation of hostilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>Without, therefore, entering into any discussion of the morality of furnishing to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> the means of waging a war so sarge, so monstrous, as that now raging on this continent, it would seem that the simplest dictates of self-interest should unite all those who have already ventured investments in the <rs>Federal</rs> funds in a concerted effort to cut off all further supplies, and thus to force that cessation of hostilities which alone can save the investments already made from entire loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>If the capitalist of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> withhold further supplies, the resources of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> are so far exhausted as to render the restoration of peace certain at no distant day. It is in the power of the same capitalists, by furnishing the means for the gratification of the insane passions of the <rs>North</rs>, to plunge the borrowers into irretrievable bankruptcy, and to render certain the loss of all their own investments, past as well as future. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/> &#x0022;In presenting the foregoing statement, reference has been intentionally omitted to the local debt contracted by the counties, pariahs and municipalities in the <rs>Northern States</rs> for the purpose of raising money to buy mercenaries in order to relieve themselves from the burthen, of the conscription.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>We have no means of estimating the amount.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>We only know that the price at which these human beings are bought for slaughter varies from <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">five hundred dollars</measure> to <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">one thousand dollars</measure> per man, and that the calls for men have amounted to very many hundreds of <num value="1000">thousands</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>Some of the <rs>Northern</rs> journals speak of this local debt as &#x0022;enormous&#x0022; but this term is too vague to justify us in hazarding an estimate of the amount.&#x0022; </p> </div3>
