<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> No new act in the drama so long upon the stage in the vicinity of <placeName reg="Cheat Mountain, West Virginia, West Virginia" key="tgn,2234058">Cheat Mountain</placeName>, has yet been enacted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>No war, or rumors of war, in our locality is (as might be expected) trippingly conveyed from tent to tent by the double-geared tongue of faithless rumor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>No news, or camp excitement is rife upon the electric wires of information; but a deep, dull stillness reigns unbroken, except by an occasional courier from our advance pickets reporting a shot or <num value="2">two</num> exchanged without up-to-date, the loss of a single man on our side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>On the <dateStruct value="--10"><day reg="10">10th ultimo</day></dateStruct>, however, the usual camp monotony was dispelled by bright <unclear>an tions</unclear> of an immediate engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/><q>&#x0022;A <unclear>y</unclear> of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>, probably <num value="100">one hundred</num>, and supposed by our pickets to be the advance guard of a larger column, had the audacity gave up within our lines, as though they had come to stay.&#x0022;</q> They were met by a shower of <unclear></unclear> from our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> stand of pickets who after firing fell back to the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>About this time our <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Rust,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Rust,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Rust</surname></persName></hi> came galloping up, inquiring--<q>&#x0022;What the hell is the matter here?&#x0022;</q> and, following quickly <unclear></unclear> the heels of our retreating foe with only <unclear></unclear> them no more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Whether fright <unclear></unclear> to might, or not, they can best answer at any rate, their feint didn't pay.--<unclear></unclear> make a respectable feint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/><unclear></unclear> when fired upon, they run like turkeys; <unclear></unclear> some puppets have done, publish <unclear></unclear> Yankeedom a victory, a brilliant <unclear></unclear> against great odds, &#x0026;c.

Further advice would be degrading. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> Owing to the recent heavy rains, mail transportation to and from <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName> is completely cut off. We have not had a <hi rend="italics">Dispatch.</hi> for <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="5days" type="date">five days</measure>--a grievous loss, I assure you for we <rs n="Kentuckian" type="group">Kentuckians</rs> are deeply interested in the events now transpiring in our native State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>After getting a <hi rend="italics">Dispatch,</hi> we almost fear to <unclear></unclear>--fear that the telegraph will <unclear>au </unclear> the imprisonment of father or <unclear></unclear>--fear that a home, the brightest spot in our boyhood recollection, has been has been desolated, our old mothers and sisters driven <unclear></unclear> by the accursed minions of the <rs>South</rs> and assisted by unmitigated thieves of our fights and honor living in our midst, nd who have grown fat on our charity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>We fear these worst of evils for <num value="2">two</num> <hi rend="italics">good</hi> reasons, viz. all we have on earth near and dear to man is on the <hi rend="italics">border,</hi> in sight of a State <unclear>(In </unclear> warring to the hill against us and our institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Our enemies, some of long standing, want only the guise of authority and the cover of darkness to pillage defenceless homes, steal negroes, and commit depredations and crimes that devils would blush to own the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> reason is, the possession of the country is being disputed by the <num value="2">two</num> powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Our homes, therefore, can have not the remotest assurance of safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Should we, the scattering few who rallied to the defence of our old mother State, under the circumstances be forced to endure this soul-harrowing fortune without the poor privilege of fighting for our own homes?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> I arrived here yesterday, and thinking you might like to hear from so important a place, I hasten to give you my impressions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The country around here is extremely lovely, and woods and fields look fairer than usually at this season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The town is improving rapidly, many new houses are going up in <address><street n="Main street">Main street</street></address>; handsome cottages rise on the outskirts, and the whole bears a well-to-do progressing air, as if the war had as yet done this great harm here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/><num value="2">Two</num> excellent hotels are filled to overflowing mainly with refugees from the threatened portions of the <rs>State</rs>, and some of the larger houses have been taken for hospitals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/><num value="1">One</num> of them is a fever hospital, under the excellent management of <persName n="Davis,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Davis,William,H.,,:1"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>A little way out of town lies a torture-looking building, called the <rs type="place">Delavan House</rs>, filled with sick soldiers, under charge of <persName n="Allen,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Allen,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Allen</surname></persName>, another <rs type="role" reg="Professor">Professor</rs> of the <rs type="place">University</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Around it men are busy erecting large hospital-houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>They look nice enough, airy, and scrupulously clean; but they are so crowded together, that the emanations must soon become injurious to the patients.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>They are built of the very slightest material, simple uprights, without any braces whatsoever, and covered with planks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The latter will warp, let the rain through, and will hardly withstand a heavy snow-fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The floor, also of single planks, is a few feet above the cold clay soil, and it is evident that no amount of fuel will ever be able to produce the proper temperature.--It is said that these slides will, when completed, accommodate a <num value="1000">thousand</num> patients.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>(I met here the <rs type="role" reg="Medical-Director">Medical Director</rs>, <persName n="Cabell,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Cabell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Cabell</surname></persName>, <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> <rs type="role" reg="Professor">Professor</rs> of the <rs type="place">University</rs>, and found in the stately, gray haired old gentleman, dressed in a curious blue flannel shirt,) a most courteous and well-informed surgeon. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> At the <rs type="place">University</rs> there was to my very great surprise, not a trace left of the hundreds of wounded men who had here received so generous welcome and so successful a treatment, <unclear>L </unclear> rooms and dormitories had all been carried out, the last sick man had been moved out weeks ago, and all was in readiness for the denouncement of studies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>There were <unclear></unclear> students here, as yet; I heard of about <num value="30">thirty</num>, but more were coming in every day. Only <num value="2">two</num> of the <rs>Professors</rs>, I learned, have left--<persName n="Bledsoe,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Bledsoe,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bledsoe</surname></persName>, who is employed in the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and <persName n="Coleman,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Coleman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Coleman</surname></persName>, who has raised a company of artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Lectures were to begin, as usually, and the <rs>Professors</rs> expressed their determination to stand by the institution and to see to it, as far as in them lay, that the interests of education are not entirely swallowed up by the eagerness for fighting in the young men of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>They will provide, I am told, for military instruction of the best kind, and thus enable those who desire to spend the winter in something better than the forced inactivity of camp <unclear></unclear>, to prepare themselves thoroughly for entering the army next summer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> Around the <rs type="place">University</rs> are many beautiful country houses, in some of which boarders are taken in lieu of the usual complement of students, and where already many families have found a pleasant and economical refuge from the dangers of the border or the turmoil of the <rs>Capital</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/> There are some persons in this curious world of ours who, if not allowed to talk a great deal, would in time most assuredly burst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>It is painfully amusing to see such persons, either sitting in the parlor or standing around the hotel doors, or in their counting-rooms, deliberately discussing the acts and finding fault with the sayings and doings of their superiors &mdash; superiors in thought, word, and deed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>My fault-finding friends, did the thought never come into your comprehensive and all-discerning minds that it is an easy and delightful task to fight a battle in the parlor, on win a splendid victory around the festive board?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Or have you never observed how clearly any <num value="1">one</num> can see a thing after it has happened?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Try to remember that the men whose acts you find fault with, and about whom you gabble so much, have as much interest in the country, and have as much at stake as you or I have, and if they are not as well qualified as they ought to be, and have not the perspicuity and forethought that you have, your fault-findings and your mutterings can never make them better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Cease grumbling, then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Don't talk so much, but do. If there are evils to be removed &mdash; and we know there are, abuses to be corrected &mdash; and where will you not find them, except in ourselves &mdash; then your duty, and mine is, to talk less, and to put our shoulders to the ponderous wheels of the governmental car and help to move it on over the rough and difficult road it is compelled to travel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>My warm-blooded friends, and all those of a nervous temperament who stand in danger of exploding unless relieved by talking and grumbling, we advise you to save your redundancy of steam-power &mdash; turn it into a different channel, and make it available for your own strength and locomotion, instead of blowing it off and wasting it in the faces of other people. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>It is proposed that New York should increase her quota to a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> men.
