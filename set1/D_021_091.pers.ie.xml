<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>The relative advantages of the rival forces have been not unfairly contrasted by Southern critics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>The Confederates have the advantage in the individual excellence of their troops, in the military aptitudes of their population, in the number of well-trained officers, and probably in the more resolute determination of the men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>His efforts can hardly have been thrown away, but his troops, after all, are but soldiers of <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> standing, so that, if discipline is to be their chief reliance, they can have but little to depends upon.--There is probably not a battalion in his army which would be considered in this country as qualified for active service. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>I possess in regard to the above named articles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>You noticed, without going into the details of the process, that salt could be made from the earth taken from the floors of smoke-houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>I fully tested it, and find that it yields abundantly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>Prepare a barrel as for ashes, with plenty of straw at the bottom, filling with the scrapings from the smoke-house floor, gently dripping it; fill a vessel, boil it gently down to the consistent dryness, then place the salt in a flannel or thin cotton bag, and drain it till no water will leave it; after which spread and dry in large dishes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>It proves very strong and excellent salt for ordinary purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>Some adheres to the sides of the vessel in which it is boiled; if ground, that makes a nice table salt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>It must be boiled some distance from the fire, so that it will not burn at the side next the fire, which make it too dark for culinary purposes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/> I have devoted much time and attention to this salt matter in order to test its value to myself and others, and can confidently say that it has exceeded my expectations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>Substitute for Soda. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/> I burned the corn-cobs to fine ashes in a large iron vessel; to <num value="1">one</num> pint ashes put <num value="1">one</num> pint boiling water, or equal quantities of water and ashes, simmer them for a short time over a slow fire, take off, let settle, pour off into bottles for use; to catch pint of flour put <num value="1">one</num> tablespoonful of the extract, and it makes a richer and as light bread as soda.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>I have tried it successfully in cakes, fritters, and puddings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>At such a time as this I becomes every lady to make an effort at independence, and how can we accomplish it better than by practicing home industry and economy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>The general opinion seems to be, that it is connected, in some shape, with the tobacco said to be owned by the <rs>French Government</rs>, and deposited in the warehouses here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>If there is <num value="1">one</num> sentiment which, more than another, deserves to be designated as unanimous among all classes of the community, it is opposition to the delivery of this tobacco.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>It was purchased with the full knowledge that the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName> would almost certainly join the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>The purchasers chose to take the risk, and let them abide by it. The French Government not only refuses to acknowledge the independence of the confederacy, but, with the treaty of <placeName reg="Paris, Henry, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100914">Paris</placeName> before its eyes, prefers to see its artisans starving for the want of the raw material, to setting aside a blockade which the very terms of that treaty describe as null and void.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>Anything rather than have aught to do with the despised and detested rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>We trust in Heaven that the errand may prove bootless, as it ought to do.--We are not worthy to be acknowledged, it seems.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>Rather than acknowledge us, the <rs>French Government</rs> will most shamefully contravene a solemn engagement made to all the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>Yet when its interests is concerned, it condescends to send its ambassador accredited to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to request that we will be as forgetful of <hi rend="italics">our</hi> obligations as <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> has been, in return for the scorn with which our proposals for recognition have been received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>After all, it may be that the tobacco does not belong to <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>We have seen it stated that it is the property of <persName n="Belmont,,Auguste,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00060" reg="default:Belmont,Auguste,,,"><foreName>Auguste</foreName> <surname>Belmont</surname></persName>, a member of the firm of Rothschilder and an alien enemy. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>Why should the <rs>French Government</rs> &mdash; or rather <persName n="Belmont,,M.,Auguste,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00062" reg="default:Belmont,M.,Auguste,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <foreName>Auguste</foreName> <surname>Belmont</surname></persName>, if the tobacco be his &mdash; be exempted from the effects of the blockade any more than any other person placed in the same predicament?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>There are hundreds of individuals owning tobacco in exactly the same situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>What claim has the <rs>French Government</rs> upon our courtesy, that they have not?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>To permit this tobacco to go away, would be playing into <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00063" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName>'s hands precisely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>Thus <persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00068" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName> will find the dearest wish of his heart gratified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>The markets will be furnished in spite of us, and he may sit down perfectly contented. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/> We commenced the attack at sunrise this morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>Our order of battle is said to be the strongest known to military science.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>We advanced in <num value="3">three</num> parallel lines or corps, each <num value="1">one</num> in line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> or front corps was led by <persName n="Hardee,Major-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00125" reg="mostcommon:Hardee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>Hardee</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>The batteries have been handled with consummate skill and effect throughout the day by their respective officers. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>The nature of the ground is exceedingly unfavorable for field operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>The woods are quite open, however &mdash; much more so than they are in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>; but they never the less interfere very much with the evolutions of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>The ground is rolling, and in many places quite wet and boggy near the water courses, several of which cross the field, and still further impeded the operations of the day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>The sun is just rising as his division is hurled against them like a thunderbolt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>The enemy was not expecting an attack, as was evident from the condition in which he received us. Indeed, he was not aware of our near presence; he never expected us to attack him, and was doubtful whether we would ever allow him to get near enough to attack us. <persName n="Hardee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00132" reg="mostcommon:Hardee,nomatch:0"><surname>Hardee</surname></persName> <q>&#x0022;set his squadron in the field&#x0022;</q> with great judgment, and led them most gallantly throughout the day.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>The enemy was at length driven from his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line of encampments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>Meanwhile he recovered from his surprise, and met our onset with firmness and resolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>The fighting now became hot and close, and raged with great violence and fury along our entire front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>The right and left wings, as well as our centre, were engaged, and the roar of artillery and the rattle of musketry fairly shock the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>But on <persName n="Hardee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00133" reg="mostcommon:Hardee,nomatch:0"><surname>Hardee</surname></persName> presses, backed up by <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00134" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName> and followed by <persName n="Polk,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00135" reg="mostcommon:Polk,nomatch:0"><surname>Polk</surname></persName> &mdash; each corps rolling onward like succeeding waves of the storm-lashed sea. <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Hardee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00136" reg="mostcommon:Hardee,nomatch:0"><surname>Hardee</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName> advances, but it is done slowly; for the enemy has rallied his forces, and is handling them with coolness and spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>We moved forward as it were by inches, but still we did move; and never at any time during the day did we lose <num value="1">one</num> foot of the ground we gamed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/> At length we reached the centre of the enemy's encampment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>He yielded his home in the woods with much reluctance, and disputed every foot of ground with courage and resolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>Thus far we have advanced through the woods, which are almost destitute of undergrowth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>Everywhere the trees bear the marks of the terrible conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>Limbs were carried away, and in some places trees a foot in diameter were cut off. In a few instances, the long, sharp rifled cannon balls passed entirely through the trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>The traces of the musketry fire are to be seen everywhere upon the trees and bushes, and also in the numbers of the dead and wounded over whom we advanced. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/> At <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time> the resistance had increased, and become more obstinate than at any time during the day. <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00137" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,A.,Sidney,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>, in order to make a sure thing of it, placed himself at the head of our attacking force and led the charge in person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>He tell and died soon afterwards, but not until the enemy had again given way all along the lines.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/> Thus a brave soldier and skillful officer has gone down before the red tide of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>He fell in the very arms of victory, with our flag upraised and advancing under the mighty impetus given to our attack by his own individual heroism and during.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>Let the <rs>Republic</rs> do justice to his memory, and repair the grievous wrongs which have of late been heaped upon him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>The fall of <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00142" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,A.,Sidney,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> did not in the least discourage our men; for they knew the gallant <rs>Beauregard</rs> was still left to them, with many other officers of skill and courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>On they press, therefore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>Only a portion of our reserves were ever brought into action, there being no necessity for it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/> At <time value="5:30oclock">half-past 5 o'clock</time> the enemy was in full retreat, and hotly pursued by the victorious Confederates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>He fled back to the <rs>Tennessee</rs>, and took shelter under his gunboats and river works, the fire from which was too heavy for our light field batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>Night, too, had come on, and our army returned to the enemy's camp, and are now occupying it &mdash; The Federal <unclear> left</unclear> their tents standing, together with all their camp equipage, quarmaster and commissary stores, private baggage, medical supplies and considerable ammunition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>The attack was so furious &mdash; it came so much like the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> clap of thunder when the storm begins &mdash; and the pursuit so close and unrelenting, that they had no time to remove anything, not even to gather up their records and half-finished letters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>The amount of property taken is immense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>Our men are now regaling themselves upon the ample supplies of excellent food everywhere to be found. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/> I am unable to speak with certainty of the number of the enemy's forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/><num value="1">One</num> of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> prisoners I encountered (a Lieutenant who formerly belonged to the old army) estimated them at <num value="120000">120,000</num> men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>again, at <num value="75000">75,000</num>, and some at <num value="50000">50,000</num>. <persName n="Prentiss,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00145" reg="mostcommon:Prentiss,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Prentiss</surname></persName>, who was captured about <time value="5oclock">5 o'clock</time>, says that the <rs>Federal</rs> army on this side of the river was composed of <num value="6">six</num> divisions, of about <num value="7500">7,500</num> each, which would make the forces of the enemy engaged about <num value="45000">45,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>They probably exceeded this number, without including the forces on the other side of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>At no time had we as many men engaged as the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/> Nor can I speak with certainly of the number of batteries or prisoners we have captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>It is too early after the battle, and too much confusion prevails for me to get at the precise facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>The number of prisoners is variously estimated; some say <num value="2000">2,000</num>, and others <num value="4000">4,000</num>; <num value="1">one</num> report has it that <num value="1">one</num> entire brigade has been captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>This is, doubtless, a mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>Among the prisoners are many officers, and the greater part of the <orgName type="regiment" key="7IWRegiment">Seventh <rs n="Iowa" type="nativeamerican">Iowa</rs> regiment</orgName>, who lately petitioned the <orgName n="Federal Congress" type="congress">Federal Congress</orgName> for permission to <unclear>lus ribe</unclear> upon their banner the victories of <placeName reg="Ladds, Marion, Tennessee" key="tgn,2479006">Belmont</placeName> and <persName n="Donelson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00146" reg="mostcommon:Donelson,nomatch:0"><surname>Donelson</surname></persName>. </p> </q><bibl n="The army correspondent"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>The number of batteries taken is said to be <num value="18">eighteen</num>, which, allowing <num value="6">six</num> pieces to the battery, would make <num value="108">one hundred and eight</num> guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>It is more probable that parts of <num value="18">eighteen</num> batteries were taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>Several stands of colors were also captured--<num value="3">three</num> by the <orgName type="regiment" key="1LARegiment">1st Louisiana regiment</orgName> alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>We took her crew off, except her captain, steward and cook, and sent her to <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> for adjudication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>There were <num value="5">five</num> vessels in sight at her capture, which will participate in the prize money; The <rs>Florida</rs>, <term type="ship">flag-ship</term>, <rs type="ship">James Adger Flambean</rs>, <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName>, and <term type="ship">ship</term> <rs type="ship">Onward</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/> This success has aroused us afresh, and we are on the alert constantly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/> During the daytime everything is quiet and goes on as usual, but as soon as twilight begins to deepen our watchfulness begins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>Our vessel is ready to slip anchor and steam away at an instant's warning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>Not a light is to be seen on deck or in the gangways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>At the masthead, yardarms, catheads, gangways, and on the paddle-boxes, are stationed sentries, relieved every <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>, peering into the gloom, on the lookout for lights or dark objects.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/> Guns are cast loose forward, and the quarter gunners and primers stand ready to point and fire at any suspicious object which the darkness may reveal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>Every night we are called to quarters, whether anything is in sight or not. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/> On the night of the <dateStruct value="--22"><day reg="22">22d ult.</day></dateStruct>, all was still on deck, as I have described, when suddenly, about half an hour after I had turned in, I heard the call to quarters, the anchor slipped, the chain splash as it fell into the water, and the bell strike <num value="4">four</num>; <q>&#x0022;go ahead fast.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/> A light had been seen some distance ahead, but had disappeared at the moment we slipped anchor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>We crowded on steam and shaped our course in the direction indicated by the lookout.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>In a few minutes the light was again reported from the masthead, and was soon seen distinctly from the paddle-boxes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>I looked for it in vain for a long time and strained my eyes in the dark until I saw half-a-dozen lights; but we soon came near enough for us to see the vessel itself, and we went after her with all the speed we could command &mdash; some <num value="7">seven</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> knots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>As we approached the object, though still <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> off, all hands were much excited, as we took her to be the <rs>Isabel</rs> trying to run in with a cargo of ammunition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>At length we got closer, and as we gained upon her our pivot gun was made to bear on the lights and fired, immediately followed by our forward battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>As the smoke cleared away the lights became dimmer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>Shot after shot were fired, still keeping up the chase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>Blue lights shone from the chase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/><q>&#x0022;Never mind that, keep on firing, if she is all right she ought to heave to; fire on until we see that we are gaining on her&#x0022;</q> The order was obeyed, and soon we found ourselves gaining, and the bright light showed us that the strange steamer was lying broadside on, have to. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/> Then we showed a light, and our captain asked, <q>&#x0022;What steamer is that?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/> <q>&#x0022;The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Oriental</rs>, with troops for <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName>.&#x0022;</q> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/> <q>&#x0022;We didn't know we were so close in shore,&#x0022;</q> was the reply. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/> <q>&#x0022;Send your captain aboard.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/> The captain of the <rs>Oriental</rs> then came aboard, and after he left we heard that they were very much frightened, for our shot came all around them, and the last shot we fired went directly over their quarter-deck, obliging every <num value="1">one</num> in that vicinity to dodge it to save their heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>They took us for the <rs>Nashville</rs>, and that was the reason they did not stop at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>The casemates of the fort could be counted with the naked eye, and the colors of the flags on <placeName reg="Castle Pinckney">Castle Pinckney</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Fort Moultrie</placeName> were vastly distinguished without a glass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>We saw <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> steamers and several sailing vessels in there. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/> This morning just after daybreak, we discovered a chance close alongside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>We took from it <num value="5">five</num> contrabands, among whom was a woman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>They left <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> at <time value="12am">midnight</time>, and passed <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> without being discovered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>They were almost frozen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>We put them in the engine-room, and when thoroughly thawed out they gave a great deal of information of such importance, that the captain sent them to <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName> at once, and also sent with them the prisoners taken from the <rs>Emily St. Pierre</rs>, who had been on board since her capture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/><num value="1">One</num> of the negroes is a blacksmith and the woman is his wife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>He was at <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName> when we attacked that place, and has been engaged in the rebel Government machine shops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>He was inside of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>He says they have <num value="80">eighty</num> guns there, of which the largest calibre are <measure n="8inch" type="distance">eight-inch</measure>. So our <measure n="11inch" type="distance">eleven-inch</measure> guns are better than any they have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>He also says that they are building a ram at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, and have been working on it night and day for some time, and expect to finish it in <measure n="30days" type="date">thirty days</measure>; that there are <num value="8">eight</num> vessels there loaded with cotton, waiting to run out, and that when we and the <name>Adger</name> ran in yesterday, all thought <q>&#x0022;the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were come, sure;&#x0022;</q> that crowd and crowds of ladies, as well as men, came down to the docks of the city to examine us through their glasses, and the greatest excitement prevailed throughout the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>He had planned to run away some time since, and a week ago was all ready, and had an armful of papers, but the night was too clear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>They came off so suddenly last night that they could bring no papers.
