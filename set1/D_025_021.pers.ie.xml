<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The people of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> did not enter into this war without having <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> maturely considered all the consequences, and thoroughly weighed all the chances of success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>When they drew the sword, it was with a perfect knowledge that they were about to engage in a long, bloody, and tedious war. They knew perfectly well the strength of their enemy, and the extent of his resources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>They never calculated upon uninterrupted success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>They knew that in all wars it was in the habit of constantly shilling from <num value="1">one</num> side to the other, and they made up their minds to persevere in spite of the fickleness of fortune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Prepared for the worst that could happen, and resolved not to be cast down by any reverse, they have in all cases stood disaster and defeat with a steady equanimity which is the wonder and admiration of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Commencing the struggle with all the nations of the earth opposed to them, their courage, their magnanimity, and their fortitude, have subdued the hearts of all those who at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> contemplated their supposed approaching annihilation with pleasure.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> Proposals of submission are usually made to nations who have lost their last army &mdash; who are no longer able to raise an arm in their own defence &mdash; who are overrun, trodden down and kept under foot by the overwhelming force of their invaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>As long as that spirit continues to exist no people can be considered as subjugated, and to treat them as such it in commit a <num value="40">forty</num> which can draw upon the party committing it nothing more agreeable than the contempt and derision of the civilized world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>On all sides the sun is emerging from the temporary cloud by which it was obscured, and doubtless it will soon put forth in meridian splendor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>We may therefore conclude that there is no truth whatever in it, indeed, it seems to be very evident that not only the <rs>British Cabinet</rs>, but the large maturity of the <rs>British</rs> nation, are opposed to recognizing the independence of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Whatever may be the designs of that personage, he is well knows to be the most inscrutable of all <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> living statesmen, and it is not likely that he should let them escape before they had become ripe for execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>It is probable that his conversation with <persName n="Roebuck,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00030" reg="mostcommon:Roebuck,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Roebuck</surname></persName> and <persName n="Lind,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00031" reg="mostcommon:Lind,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Lind</surname></persName>, say was designed as a feeler, after the manner of the pamphlets which he makes some <num value="1">one</num> father just before he makes an important political movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>But this is a probability merely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>There is little doubt that he favors the cause of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and, if he could obtain the concurrence of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, there is just as little that he would recognize us at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>But that consent he will not obtain, unless we should be reduced to the last extremity, of which we see no probability at present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Without the concurrence in question we are well convinced that he will not take the important step, so that we need entertain no very strong hopes from that quarter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> As we have told our people from the beginning we must fight this war out ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>It is vain to look for assistance elsewhere than in the valor of our soldiers, and the skill of our officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The ridiculous cry, &#x0022;cotton is king,&#x0022; with which we entered into it, cost more blood, and did more harm, than all the cotton that ever was raised in <placeName reg="North America" key="tgn,1000001">North America</placeName> can pay for.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> In the portion of this address which we republish to-day there appears a very strange statement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>It is to the effect that he, (<persName n="Vallandigham,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00033" reg="mostcommon:Vallandigham,nomatch:0"><surname>Vallandigham</surname></persName>) while in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, did not meet with a single person who was not resolved to perish rather than yield to the pressure of arms, but that every person he conversed with expressed himself willing, if the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> would withdraw their troops, to discuss the terms of reunion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>We do not know who were the persons with whom <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> V. conversed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>We are sure we have conversed with many more Southerners than he ever did, and we never heard the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <unclear></unclear> yet speak in favor of reunion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>He has certainly made a great mistake somehow or other. </p> </div3>
