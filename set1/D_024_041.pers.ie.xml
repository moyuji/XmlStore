<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>In it the writer attempts to contract the position of affairs at the time the letter was written (<date value="1862-11-17">Nov. 17, 1862.</date>) with that of <num value="1">one</num> year previous, and argues that the advance of the <rs>Union</rs> forces late the factory of the <rs>South</rs> has been gradual since the commencement of the war. Upon this subject he says: &#x0022;In a word the insurgents do not now hold a foot of ground which they did not hold early in the war, while the flag of the <rs>Union</rs> has been constantly advancing and now floats somewhere on the soil or over the fortifications of every slave State save <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Their armies have, in the meantime, been driven from an area of country embracing in the aggregate not less than <num value="100000">100,000</num> square miles, and occupied by a population ranging from <num value="1500000">1,500,000</num> to <num value="2000000">2,000,000</num> of people.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> The writer then alludes to the relative naval strength of the <num value="2">two</num> sections, and says that while all the incipient efforts on the part of the <rs>South</rs> to create a navy have been defeated, and her vessels destroyed, the navy of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> has, within the year, grown from a comparatively small to a very great power, closing all the ports of the <rs>South</rs>, precluding, save with Federal consent, all entrance to or exit from them unless by stealth or accident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/><num value="2">Two</num> other elements of relative strength for the continuation of the war are considered in the letter, viz: man and money.

To corroborate this view, the <rs>French Minister</rs> is referred to the census statistics of <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> Alluding to the emancipation proclamation of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00031" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, issued in <dateStruct value="-09-"><month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct>, <persName n="Dayton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00032" reg="mostcommon:Dayton,nomatch:0"><surname>Dayton</surname></persName> says: &#x0022;Whoever may have entertained apprehensions of a servile war, such I do not suppose for a moment to have been contemplated by the <rs>President</rs> in foreshadowing his policy.&#x0022; The allusion to this proclamation is made to show that slaves hitherto have been an element of strength rather than of weakness to the <rs>South</rs> in the pending war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> Passing from the question of population, <persName n="Dayton,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00033" reg="mostcommon:Dayton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Dayton</surname></persName> proceeds to the consideration of the relative monetary element of strength in war of the <num value="2">two</num> sections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>He has arrived at the conclusion that while the resources of the <rs>South</rs> in men are practically exhausted, its resources in money must be equally so. He says that he is instructed that the <rs>South</rs>, with a floating debt of <measure n="100000009dollars" type="currency">$100,000,009</measure> represented by paper at a discount of <num value="0.75">75 per cent</num>, have neither raised, nor have the means of raising, a revenue equal to <measure n="10000000dollars" type="currency">$10,000,000</measure>, in any form or for any purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The Minister says. &#x0022;The little success of our overtures might chill the interest with which we follow the fluctuations of this contest; but the sentiment to which we have yielded is too since for indifference to find a place in our thoughts, that we should cease to be painfully affected while the war continues to rage.&#x0022; He says that the <rs>French Government</rs> is none the less ready amid the wishes formed in favor of peace, to take into account all the susceptibilities of national feeling; and does not at all question the right of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> to decline the co-operation of the great maritime powers of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, but asks whether this co-operation is not the only means which offers itself to the <rs>Cabinet</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> to hasten the close of the war; and further, if the <rs>Federal Government</rs> believes that it ought to repel any foreign intervention, could it not honorably accept the idea of direct informal conferences with the authority which may represent the <name>States</name> of the <rs>South</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>He says that the opening of informal conferences between the belligerent parties does not necessarily imply the immediate cessation of hostilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>He then proceeds: &#x0022;That nothing, therefore, would hinder the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, without renouncing the advantage which it believes it can attain by the continuation of the war, from entering upon informal conferences with the <rs>Confederates</rs> of the <rs>South</rs>, in case they should show themselves disposed thereto.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Representatives or commissioners of the <num value="2">two</num> parties could assemble at such point as it should be deemed proper to designate, and which could for this purpose be deemed neutral.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>He thinks that the conferences which can thus be held in Congress have a great advantage over any that could be organized on the plan suggested by the <rs>French Minister</rs>, viz: that Congress, if it thought wise could call a <orgName n="National Convention" type="convention">National Convention</orgName> to adopt its recommendations and give them all the solemnity and binding force of organic law.

<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/> The <rs>North</rs> is fighting for self-preservation as much as for Southern subjugation, the latter of which is now chiefly desired because it involves the former.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>The time when, possessed of devils, is sought to exterminate the <rs>South</rs>, in a fit of foaming, diabolic phrensy, has long since passed, and, in spite of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00271" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s proclamation, the clear, distinct object of the great mass of that nation in the further prosecution of this war is to save themselves from the overhanging avalanche of ruin which the success of the <rs>Southern</rs> cause must precipitate upon their heads. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/> They have learned a good deal since this war commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>They were going to wipe us out in <measure n="60days" type="date">sixty days</measure>! The <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 7">Seventh Regiment</orgName> alone, in the opinion of the magnificent <rs>James Watson Webb</rs>, would be sufficient for our subjugation!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>But <num value="700">seven hundred</num> regiments have not accomplished the feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/><measure n="2years" type="date">Two years</measure> of war, and they have not even taken <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, which lies on the margin of our territory, and is accessible by fine, navigable stresses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>Wipe us out in <measure n="60days" type="date">sixty days</measure>! And now, after <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>, they are engaged in a death struggle to keep themselves from being &#x0022;wiped out&#x0022; from the map of nations! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/> The final defeat of the <rs>North</rs> in this struggle involves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>Its total bankruptcy &mdash; commercial, financial, and political.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>No lobster, divested of its <unclear>hell,</unclear> was ever more at the mercy of the rest of the animal erection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>It produces nothing of its own which cannot be produced elsewhere in greater perfection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>Its manufactories would tumble into ruins: for the <rs>South</rs>, their principal customer even if it could ever defile its hands again with <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> actions, could buy cheaper and better elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>Its chips would rot at the wharves; for the <rs>South</rs> would carry its staples in its own vessels, and the monopoly of the coasting trades the fishing bounties, &#x0026;c., would be dreams of the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>The cities which have rivalled the fame of <persName n="Tyre,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00272" reg="mostcommon:Tyre,nomatch:0"><surname>Tyre</surname></persName> and <placeName reg="Babylon, White Pine, Nevada" key="tgn,2141869">Babylon</placeName> would be forsaken for the new marts of commerce that would spring up in the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>The fountains of public revenue, mainly derived under the <rs>Union</rs> from the great staples of the <rs>South</rs>, would be dried up.--There would be neither means to pay the enormous national debt, nor to carry on the <rs>Government</rs> after the war. Repudiation, which will be the inevitable recourse of the <rs>North</rs> to pay its existing Habilities, will not improve its credit, and enable it to raise the wind hereafter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>Direct taxation heavy enough to meet its wants, would produce another revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>In any event, the process of disintegration successfully inaugurated would proceed with irresistible power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>The Northwest would not up for itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>The Middle States would shake themselves clear of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, which might humbly petition to be once more received as a British colony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>These are some of the inevitable calamities which the <rs>North</rs> is now fighting to escape, but which, in all probability, no effort she can make will be sufficient to avert.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>Her doom is written, and, what is worse for her, it has been written by her own hand, and she will be her own executioner. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>They only differ from the <name>Abolitionists</name> in the manner of reconstructing that concern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>They are for accomplishing it by means of a treaty, while the <name>Abolitionists</name> are bent upon subjugating us. But the <rs>Union</rs>--the blessed Union--&#x0022;the best Government the world ever saw&#x0022;--Is the cry of them all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>It is natural that the men should relax in their discipline when they are told that whole States are breaking off from the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> and coming to fight their battles for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>It is the most critical period of the whole war. Every man in the country subject to military duty should be at his post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>Every struggler should come back at once to his duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>The Conscription law, which has been faithfully and thoroughly executed in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, should be executed with equal fidelity and thoroughness in every other States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>The enrolling officers should do their duty with the most searching and unshrinking energy.
