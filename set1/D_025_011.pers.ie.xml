<head>&#x0022;situation&#x0022; of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army, as stated by themselves.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> Yesterday, we published a brief extract from a letter in the <orgName n="New York Tribune" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi></orgName>, dated <placeName reg="Harrison's Landing, Charles City, Virginia" key="tgn,2378614">Harrison's Landing</placeName> <date value="07-02">July 2.</date> The letter shows very clearly the <q>&#x0022;situation&#x0022;</q> of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> after the fight, and we give fuller extracts from it: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> As we approached the wharf, I noticed the land to the left was a dead level, and was white with the covers of our baggage trains, which were here drown up in an immense solid body, which we had taken to be tents as seen from the steamer's deck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>To the right, the land rose gently from the river until in reached an elevation of perhaps <measure n="30feet" type="distance">thirty feet</measure>. Up along this elevated plain and along the banks of the river our sick and wounded men stood shivering in the rain, without tents, or knapsacks, or arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Here and there a single <persName n="Sibley,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Sibley,Henry,,,:1"><surname>Sibley</surname></persName> tent was visible, and also a sprinkling of white roofed baggage wagons. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> The scene presented as I landed defies all description. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> Under some trees which lay around in clusters our men were crouched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>They looked as if they were more dead than alive, they were covered to the crown of their heads with mud, their faces and clothes were literally coated; while their shoes and boots had several pounds of the nasty yellow stuff stuck into and all around them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Whole regiments were immersed to their knees, many up to their waists, in the yellow river, with branches of trees and pieces of sticks, washing and scraping off the dirt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Cavalry men were out so far trying to get a <q>&#x0022;clean wash, &#x0022;</q> that the water reached their soldiers while they vigorously scraped themselves and their weary steeds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Many of the men had not had a any biscuit for <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure>. I met an officer who was wounded in the eye, his face covered with blood and mud. He was vainly offering <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">$5</measure> for something to eat. I moved up the hill through awful pools of mud. sinking down to the knees at every step.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>I passed a house which had the appearance of having been deserted by its owner, as there were no doors or windows visible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>This house was so crowded with sick and wounded, poor, miserable men, that a doctor who came up while I was there could not possibly get in. A great crowd was assembled around the doors, who seemed to envy the more fortunate ones inside. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> On the top of the hill there was rather a fine house, with plenty of out-houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>This was our general hospital, and it was crammed full to its utmost capacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>I conversed with many brave men who had fought their way with our army through hosts of Confederates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>They were not dismayed or frightened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Quite the contrary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>In a calm and cool manner &mdash; not noticing the torrents of rain falling on their heads &mdash; there they stood telling of the vast hordes of Confederates by which they were outnumbered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>I stood in the centre of many a great group of privates who gathered around me to learn the news from the rest of the world &mdash; for they saw by my clean linen that I got among them by some other route than <placeName reg="Savage Station">Savage Station</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>I did not hear from these men <num value="1">one</num> single word of murmur or complaint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>They said, <q>&#x0022;We are ready when reinforcements arrive to go at them again.&#x0022;</q> At this time there was a schooner at the end of the wharf, and a guns of at least <num value="300">three hundred</num> contrabands were in line, each having a box of biscuit on his shoulder, carrying them ashore. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> The river along the wharf is very shallow, and only <num value="1">one</num> vessel of light draught can come alongside the end of the wharf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The portion of the <rs>Supply Fleet</rs> which had arrived lay scattered in the river some distance off. The enemy were throwing shells into our lines while I was on shore, which were quickly responded to by our men. About <time value="12oclock">twelve o'clock</time>, I took a small boat, to visit the gunboat fleet in company with <persName n="Elliott,Lieutenant-Colonel,Daniel,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="default:Elliott,Daniel,,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieut Col.</roleName> <foreName>Daniel</foreName> <surname>Elliott</surname></persName>, <persName n="Camp,,Add,,,de" id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="expanded:Camp,Add,,,"><foreName>Add</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Camp</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>of <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName>, and <persName n="Munson,Doctor,L.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="default:Munson,L.,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>L.</foreName> <surname>Munson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The far famed Monitor lay in the middle of the river, and as the <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant Commanding">Lieutenant commanding</rs> was an old pupil of Col <persName n="Elliott,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Elliott,Daniel,,,"><surname>Elliott</surname></persName>, at the <rs>Colonel</rs>'s suggestion, we visited her <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> Just as we left, <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> boarded the <rs>Galena</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>He came by himself, in a boat which was pulled by <num value="16">sixteen</num> men. He stayed only a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, He passed close by the <rs>Monitor</rs>, and boarded the steamer Express which was loaded down with ammunition and which lay only a short distance from the <name>Galens</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>He then went ashore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>About this than I noticed <num value="2">two</num> separate gangs of signal officers on the top of the high house on the hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/><num value="1">One</num> party was mounted on the roof, the other on the eave of the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Those on the roof were signaling to the army lines in their rear, and those on the eave to the gunboats on the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>A general commotion was visible everywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>There was smart firing ashore, and we expected a battle every minute. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> The Express, which <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> had visited, moved up and lay outside some <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> barge, and commenced unloading her ammunition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The gunboats all shifted their positions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The Monitor moved down the river to protect the rear, and in <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of an hour she and others were belching forth into the woods before them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> <hi rend="italics"><time value="4pm">4 o'clock P. M.</time></hi>--The firing has ceased, the transshipment of stores and provisions of all kinds is going on vigorously, and large transports, loaded down with sick and wounded, are steaming away down stream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The mail boat has received an order to be ready in an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>All the mails she brought with her she carries back, with orders to bring up from <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName> the headquarters mail only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The Paymasters that came up all return &mdash; so our born will have to wait a little longer for their letters and their well earned cash. </p> </div4>

<head>The situation of our army.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> <hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>,</hi><date value="07-04">July 4.</date>--The <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Warner</rs>, which left <placeName reg="Harrison's Landing, Charles City, Virginia" key="tgn,2378614">Harrison's Landing</placeName> at <time value="6oclock">6 o'clock</time> last evening brings intelligence up to that hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>About noon yesterday the <rs>Confederates</rs> in considerable force approached to within about <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> of <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s front and commenced shelling, but with no effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Our force was drawn up in line of battle, and the gunboats opened from the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The enemy approached no nearer, and when the <rs>Warner</rs> left it was believed that nothing important would ensue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Our troops were busily occupied in entrenching their position, and were well on to a state that would enable them to defy a vastly superior foe. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The enemy, in large force, are on the east side of the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, and threaten not only <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing"><persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s right wing</orgName>, but the navigation of the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>These twin purposes will give employment to the flotilla, and on the activity and efficiency of the gunboats a very great deal depends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The construction of batteries so as to interrupt the navigation of the river would be laying direct siege to <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s position, and would place his army in an extremely critical situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>It may well be expected batteries will be planted on the left bank of the river, masked until prepared to open on our transports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>In view of the probabilities in this regard, quite a number of vessels and other transports on their way up have been turned back toward <orgName n="Newport News" type="newspaper">Newport News</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> It is supposed that the <rs>Confederates</rs> will attempt to follow up their advantage and press <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> to the extent of their ability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>That they confront him with a vastly superior force there is no doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>How long this disparity is to be suffered to exist is for the <rs>Government</rs> and the country to say. Of the imperative necessity for more troops there can be no question &mdash; not in a month's time, but a week's. So long as <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName>'s force remains unoccupied, no fear can justly be entertained of another descent towards <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> or the <orgName n="Shenandoah Valley" type="newspaper">Shenandoah Valley</orgName>, and this suggests reasons enough why this force should not be materially employed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>That the <rs>Government</rs> is taking bold and vigorous measures to render available for the emergency the force now in the field, it may be some consolation for the reader to know, Details are not permissible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> It would not be dealing fairly with the truth to say that all apprehension for the safety of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> is at an end. Probably the present position is the strongest that could have been taken within an equal distance from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>But the forces of the <rs>Confederates</rs> is immensely superior in numbers, though in nothing else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>For the whole distance from <orgName n="Newport News" type="newspaper">Newport News</orgName> to <placeName reg="Harrison's Landing, Charles City, Virginia" key="tgn,2378614">Harrison's Landing</placeName>, we have but a small force, except at the first named place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>To keep the river open, and the channel of supplies and communication free, will require all the activity of which the <orgName n="Navy" type="military">Navy</orgName> are capable, for upon, the gunboats will devolve that important duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs> is virtually in the hands of the <rs>Confederates</rs> again. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/> It is natural enough, perhaps, to seek, when a disaster occur, somebody to whom the exclusive blame may be imputed; and it is equally natural that much of that blame should be altogether unreasonable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>Nothing is visitors except now and then when a flash gives a partial and uncertain light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>It was a great Federal victory; it was a Confederate stampede; it was a drawn battle; it was a Federal defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>Again, it was an engagement in which <num value="50000">50,000</num> men were slain; it was a battle in which the <rs>Federal</rs> loss was about <num value="900">900</num> men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>Above the hurly-burly and through the darkness we can see, however, a few things distinctly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>We know that the <orgName n="Stars and Stripes" type="newspaper">Stars and Stripes</orgName> are at New Orleans, and that there is a General there so intolerant of the saucy tongues of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> ladies, that he answers a scornful phrase with brutal outrage, and replies to a sarcasm in much the same manner as a revolted negro would punish the <hi rend="italics">previous scoldings of his master's daughter.</hi> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/> We know also that the <rs>Mississippi</rs> has been gallantly swept up and down, and that, so far as the guns of the <rs n="iron ships" type="product">iron ships</rs> can reach, the valley of that river is in the power of the <rs>Federal</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>But the principal fact is that after the great invasion had seemed to have almost completed its work, and when the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> had just resolved to celebrate the <dateStruct value="-07-4"><day reg="4">Fourth</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> as a double jubilee, everything goes back to its original condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>There are men in the <rs>Northern States</rs> who can tell why it happens that the darkness is made so thick about many transactions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>Some people know how it occurs that we never hear any report as to the health of the troops or the state of the wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>People exist who could, if they cared, say that shiploads of fever stricken wretches daily come northward to die, and who could repeat the tales those pallid wretches tell of the condition of those they have left behind.--The secret explanation of the new call for fresh levies could be given by those who know what is happening in these hospitals where wounds never heal, and where fever and ague so seldom give up their prey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>If men fight in a darkness only fitfully lit up, they die in a gloom which no ray ever penetrates. </p>

In the <orgName type="regiment" key="1Section">first section</orgName> of that act the following proviso was inserted: </p> 
<div4 type="letter" n="1"> 
<head></head> <opener> <salute>&#x0022;Provided, furth,</salute> </opener> 
<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/> That all persons under the age of <measure n="18years" type="date">18 years</measure> or over the age of <measure n="35years" type="date">35 years</measure>, who are now enrolled in the military sevice of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, in the regiments, squadrons battalions, and companies hereafter to be reorganized, shall be required to remain in their respective companies, squadrons, battalions, and regiments, for <measure n="90days" type="date">ninety days</measure>, unless their places shall be sooner supplied by other recruits, not now in the service, who are between the ages of <num value="18">18</num> and <measure n="35years" type="date">35 years</measure>. And all laws and parts of laws providing for the reorganization of volunteers, and the organization thereof into companies, squadrons, battalions, and regiments, shall be, and the same are hereby, repealed.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/> Soon after the passage and promulgation of this law, the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary at War</rs> announced his interpretation of its various sections and provisions, as they were to be exemplified in their practical operation upon the parties designed to be affected by them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/>Amond numerous others, the following is found: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/> <q>&#x0022;When any company, now in service <hi rend="italics">for <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure>,</hi> shall, before <date value="07-16">the 16th day of July next,</date> attain the maximum number prescribed by this act, without including the men under <num value="18">18</num> and over <measure n="35years" type="date">35 years</measure> of age, all such men may be discharged, and such of them as remain in service on th said day, will, upon their application, be <num value="10">ten</num> discharged, whether such maximum is attained or not.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/> Thus stands the law, as expounded by the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary at War</rs>, and intended as an accompanying exppose of his views on its practical operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>It will be seen that the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary at War</rs> only includes <hi rend="italics">the <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> men,</hi> and thus, by implication, <hi rend="italics">enclude</hi> <q>&#x0022;all persons&#x0022;</q> other than <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> men --evidently included, and, in my opinion, expressly designed to be includd, in the <rs>Conscript Act</rs>, as before recited. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/> The language used in the <name>Act</name> of Congress is very expilcit, and it would seem difficult to place any other construction on it than what is so plainly and with marked distinctness expressed in the very clear and precise language employed by its framers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/>It is--&#x0022; <hi rend="italics">That all persons</hi> under the age of <num value="18">18</num> and over the age of <measure n="35years" type="date">35 years</measure>, <hi rend="italics">who are now enrolled in the military service of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName></hi> shall be required to remain for <measure n="90days" type="date">ninety days</measure>, unless their places can be sooner supplied by other recruits, act now in the service, who are between the ages of <num value="18">18</num> and <measure n="35years" type="date">35 years</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/> No language can be more explicit than this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>To my mind it admits of no doubts; and it is but fair to presume that the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary at War</rs>, in his exposition, could not have intended to embrace <q>&#x0022;all persons&#x0022;</q> so distinctly included in this <hi rend="italics">provie,</hi> inserted in the <name>Conscript</name> law. It would seem he must have intended only to refer to <measure n="12months" type="date">12 months</measure> men, and to have no alluston to <q>&#x0022;all persons&#x0022;</q> embrace in the law of Congress. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/> This would be the only construction which could fairly be placed on the exposition of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary at War</rs>; but for the recent order published by the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant General</rs>, revoking <rs n="General Order 44" type="misc">General order No. 44</rs>, and announcing that all persons who have enlisted for the war, who were under the ages of <num value="18">18</num> and over the age of <measure n="35years" type="date">35 years</measure>, would not be discharged <date value="1862-07-16">on the 16 of July, 1862.</date> Had this order contained the <hi rend="italics">qualification</hi> that the persons designated in it, who had enlisted for the war, <hi rend="italics">since <date value="1862-04-16">the 16th day of April, 1862,</date></hi> would not be discharged <date value="1862-07-16">on the 16th day of July, 1862,</date> it would have been consistent with, and auxiliary to, the <name>Conscript</name> act. But as the order stands, and is directed to be enforced, there is a painful conflict between it and the law of Congress. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/> My opinion has been asked by various persons as to the validity and legality of this order;, als0, whether this order divests the persons designated and designed to be embraced in the proviso of the <name>Conscript</name> law, of their rights and privileges, as declared and defined in the law of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/>In other words, are the persons under <num value="18">18</num> and over <measure n="35years" type="date">35 years</measure>, who had enlisted for the war, and were enrolled <hi rend="italics">previous</hi> to <date value="1862-04-16">the 16th of April, 1862,</date> excluded, by reason of this interpolating order of the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant General</rs>, from the specific remedial efficacy of the act of Congress. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/> On this subject, after the most solicitotts and matured consideration, I have not a shadow of doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>I am perfectly clear and distinct in the opinion that this order of the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant General</rs> is in direct and unmistakable conflict with the law of Congress, and , also, that there is nopower, either in the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant General</rs>, the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary at War</rs>, the <rs>President</rs>, of all combined, to interpolate any act of Congress, or to revoke, modify, or extend its provisions, in the absence of such power created and bestowed by the express provisions of the law itself, or a power derived from, and distinctly traceable to, an express grant of such power in the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>I have not been able to discover anywhere the grant of such a power, event by the most latitudinous implication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>I am, therefore, that the order in question cannot legally divest, impair, or curtall any <num value="1">one</num> right or privilege imparted to the certain designated persons in the <name>Conscript</name> act. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/> The rights and privileges <hi rend="italics">guranteed</hi> to <q>&#x0022;all persons&#x0022;</q> embraced in this <hi rend="italics">limitation and qualification of the main body of the act,</hi> are paramount, and so long as theproviso stands, are superior to any limitation or qualification sought to be derived from the body of theact by implication or liberal construction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>The <hi rend="italics">proviso</hi> takes precedence and over-rides the purview; and in case of a conflict, the purview must give place to the proviso, As a necessary legal deduction, any and all rights, privileges and immunities distinctly created by express enactment in the proviso, will revaill over all qualifications, conditions, or conflicting enactments in the main body of the act. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/> It is, however, needless to discuss such questions here, as to cite the numerious authorities in point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/>I prefer giving my opinion, as asked for, without entering upon any elaborate consideration of the law, tis spirit, reason and purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/><unclear>Surlice</unclear> it to say, the law of Congress is explicit in its provisions, in its limitations, in its conditions, and in its extent and scope, both as to <hi rend="italics">person</hi> and <hi rend="italics">time;</hi> and that in my opinion the order of the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant General</rs> is in conflict with and violative of both the letter, spirit, scope and policy of the law. With this opinion, I <hi rend="italics">reserve</hi> my reasons and authorities for another occasion, should it arise. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/> It is proper, however, in this connection, that I should here add, the order of the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant General</rs> is, according to all rules of law, both-civil and military, paramount, and of binding force unitl it is revoked, reversed or modified; an should challenge the obedient acquiescence of every <num value="1">one</num> affected or designed to be affected by it. The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and highest <hi rend="italics">duty</hi> of the soldier is implicit obedience to the orders of his superior in command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/>However arbitrary or contrary to law, as an order emanscing from the proper source, it should be obeyed in good faith until the proper remedy is properly applied. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/> In this case there is a remedy, not withstanding the suspension of the <hi rend="italics">habcas corpus</hi> act. Let the proper <q>&#x0022;application&#x0022;</q> be made, <date value="07-16">on the 16th July,</date> as required, and, if that falls, then a proper and respectful appeal to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary at War</rs>; and if that falls, Congress will not be deaf to the <q>&#x0022;application. &#x0022;</q> In the meantime, I counsel the most regular, orderly, and exact obedience to the orders issued or to be issued, in connection with this matter, until the proper remedies can be invoked and applied in the regular and proper way. <unclear>Nor</unclear> is this all. It is my duty to say to you, that however harsh, or even unjust, this order may seem, to disobey it, or disregard any enforcing order emanating from the proper officer, will be, <hi rend="italics">in law, a recall,</hi> and will merit summary punishment. </p> <closer> <salute>Respectfully,</salute> <signed><persName n="Chimer,,John,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00678" reg="default:Chimer,John,H.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName>  <surname>Chimer</surname></persName>.</signed> <lb/> <signed><persName n="Kyle,Captain,R.,R.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00679" reg="default:Kyle,R.,R.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Kyle</surname></persName>, and others.</signed> <lb/> <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, <date value="1862-07-08">July 8, 1862.</date> jy <num value="12">12</num>--1t* </closer> </div4> </div3> </div2> </div1>
