<head>Supplies.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> raid, which has made so much soles and done so little, has had its effect in guarding alarm in certain sections which contribute largely to the daily markets of the cry. Added to this is the apprehension of danger of impressing horses and, the <num value="2">two</num> <unclear></unclear> operating, supplies have been, within a few days, very much curtailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>As the raiders have gone, and as pressing is suspended &mdash; as the occasion and the action under it are passed &mdash; they can all come now in quiet and safety and get war prices for, their marketable commodities. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> The number to be fed, especially those needing fresh food &mdash; vegetables and meat &mdash; is much increased, and therefore the demand is greater.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Those who have seasonable supplies will find quick sales, and may return safe and satisfied. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head>The season food for stock.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> The season is backward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The trees have been unusually late in donning their foliage. --There have been such frequent and heavy rains as very much to interfere with the labors on the farm, and to delay the planting of the corn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>But, while the season has thus retarded some operations of the agriculturist, he has been compensated with an abundant growth of green food for stock at a time when forage is scarce and unprecedentedly high.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>At no time in our experience has the earth borne a heavier crop of verdure than at this time, and it is indeed a Godsend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Nor will any serious injury result from any delay caused by that condition of the season so propitious to the grasses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Corn, in our genial climate, will mature in good time even when planted after the middle of <dateStruct value="-06-"><month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>So there need be no fears for that crop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>On the other hand, both wheat and oats are looking admirably well, and the promise of an abundant crop was never better at this period of the year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The breadth of land occupied by the grain crops will be uncommonly large, and, though too early to speculate upon the yield, it is gratifying to behold the favorable condition of all growing crops at this time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> The abundance of grass must have its effect in diminishing the demand for forage, and tend to reduce the exorbitant prices that have prevailed. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Never before, if we may judge from their press, were they so jubilant with hope and expectation of a victory as they were when <persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,nomatch:0"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName> crossed the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Never before were they so inflated with gas and bombast &mdash; never so excessively rollicking and riotous in their precision of resplendent victories and a &#x0022;crushed rebellion!&#x0022; Even the &#x0022;officers of Government,&#x0022; so often and so sorely tried in their labors of reforming broken and defeated armies, are said to have been &#x0022;especially good natured&#x0022; at the news of the crossing, and &#x0022;seemed to think the people [<rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>] will take this as another proof of the determination and ability of our rulers [Lincoln and <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName>] to push on rapidly toward <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.&#x0022; To assist in the advance the public were assured that <persName n="Patrick,Provost Marshal-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Patrick,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Provost Marshal-General">Provost Marshal General</roleName> <surname>Patrick</surname></persName> was assiduously &#x0022;repairing the road towards <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.&#x0022;-- A rather singular proceeding while the raiders were endeavoring to destroy the same road near <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> itself!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>To cap the climax of this bombast, it is positively announced that <persName n="Hooker,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Hooker</surname></persName> remained behind at the crossing &#x0022;to superintend the <rs>Cutting Loose</rs> of the <rs type="place">Bridges</rs>, <hi rend="italics">declaring that there must be no coming back by that route!</hi>&#x0022; This statement is made by the <orgName n="Baltimore American" type="newspaper">Baltimore <hi rend="italics">American</hi></orgName> on the authority of &#x0022;a gentleman who witnessed the crossing.&#x0022; In short, the whole of Yankeedom seemed to have gone mad with joy under the delightful prospects of ending the rebellion and taking possession of all the wealth and good things of the <rs>South</rs>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>In <persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,nomatch:0"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName> they beheld another <persName><foreName>Gideon</foreName></persName>, who was invincible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Losing sight of the charlatan and braggart in the enchantment of the promised victories he held up to view from his strategy, they sung his praises all the time, but most lustily, and with the most approved nasal twang, as he pushed across the <rs>Rappahannock</rs>! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> How will they receive the news of their reverses after these follies, these absurd boasting and extravagant expectations, such as could be indulged no where on earth but amongst that peculiar people who inhabit the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>But they are great at the art of dissimulation, and may change their tune with as much facility as the organ grinder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Though a sensation people, they are quite remarkable for cunning devices to conceal real motives and feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The intercepted rogue, who answered the question, &#x0022;Where are you going?&#x0022; by replying, &#x0022;Back again!&#x0022; was certainly <num value="1">one</num> of their kith.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/> There were many incidents in the <rs n="Battle of Stone River" type="battle">battle of Stone's river</rs> that have not yet seen the light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/><num value="1">One</num> especially is worth mentioning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>In the rebel charges upon <persName n="McCook,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00083" reg="mostcommon:McCook,nomatch:0"><surname>McCook</surname></persName>'s right, the rebel <orgName type="regiment" key="KY3">3d Kentucky</orgName> was advancing, and fell upon <num value="1">one</num> of our loyal <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>These <num value="2">two</num> regiments were from the same county, and consequently were old friends and neighbors, now about to meet for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time as enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>As soon as they came close enough for recognition they mutually ceased firing and began abusing, and cursing, and swearing at each other, calling each other the most outlandish names, while the battle was roaring round them, without much attention from either side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>It was hard to tell which regiment would come off the victor in the wordy battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>As far as I could hear, both sides were terrible at swearing; but this could not always last; but, by mutual consent, they finally ceased cursing, and, grasping their muskets, charged into each other with the most unearthly yell ever heard on any field of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>Muskets were clubbed, bayonet met bayonet and in dozens of instances, when old fends made the belligerents crazy with passion, the musket was thrown away, and at it they went, pummeling, pulling, and gouging in rough and tumble style, and in a manner that any looker on would consider as a free fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>The rebels were getting rather the better of the fight, when the <orgName type="regiment" key="KY23">23d Kentucky</orgName> succeeded in giving them a flanking fire, which made them retreat, with quite a number of prisoners in their hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>The rebels had fairly got under way when the <orgName type="regiment" key="OH9">9th Ohio</orgName> came up at a double-quick, and charging on their now disordered ranks, succeeded in capturing all their prisoners, besides taking in return a great many of the rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>As the late belligerents were conducted to the rear they appeared to have forgotten all their late animosity, and were now on the best terms imaginable, laughing, and chatting, and joking; and as the rebels were well supplied with whiskey, their canteens were readily handed about from <num value="1">one</num> to the other, until they all became as jolly as possible under the circumstance. </p> </div3> <milestone unit="column" n="4"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing that we look for when the long telegraphic dispatched meet our eye is a battle, and of late no such event appears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>If the <rs>South</rs> be conquered it must be by war, and the war everywhere <unclear></unclear>. It is now all but confessed that the expedition to <placeName reg="Charleston, Kanawha, West Virginia" key="tgn,7013583">Charleston</placeName> is a failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>True, it was most formidable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>Seldom, if ever, has of great a force put to sea at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>A large army, an immense number of iron clad at a mere, gunboats, and fighting craft of all kinds, assembled after long preparation, were dispatched for the capture or destruction of that cradle of secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>But if the <rs>Federal</rs> preparations were formidable, those of their opponents were not less so. The organs of the press, which were laboring to dispel the public despondency by predicting the speedy capture of <placeName reg="Charleston, Kanawha, West Virginia" key="tgn,7013583">Charleston</placeName>, suddenly ceased their <unclear></unclear>. An ominous silence fell upon the daily decreasing war party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>In fact, it was discovered that <placeName reg="Charleston, Kanawha, West Virginia" key="tgn,7013583">Charleston</placeName> was so completely fortified, and garrisoned by so large a force, that it could only be reduced by siege operations on the largest scale, requiring an army far greater than that actually provided for the work, and warlike resources which not even the <rs>Federal Government</rs> command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>The year which has elapsed since the reverses of last spring roused the <rs>Confederates</rs> to more energy, and measures have been employed to make the chief points in the <rs>South</rs> as defensible as possible, even against the new engines of warfare which Federal ingenuity has devised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>At <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, and we presume at every place which expects an attack, iron is opposed to iron, and the result <num value="1">one</num> which gratifies us exceedingly on grounds quite independent of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> quarrel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>The war shows that the progress of military science and the diffusion of military training are all on the side of those who stand on the defensive, and that invasion of all kinds will be much more difficult things than they were in the old days of <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> campaigning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/><placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, defended not only by its forts and its iron-clads, but by its swampy country cut up by numberless rivers, now seems to be abandoned as too difficult a conquest by the <rs>Federal</rs> rulers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>Though to capture it and exercise on its inhabitants all the cruelties of New Orleans would be an exquisite pleasure to the <rs>Federals</rs>, they must, it seems, forage the enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>It is now asserted that <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, a place of comparative unimportance, is to be the object of the expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>It is possible that when the <rs>Federals</rs> arrive before it a reconnaissance may inform them that the <name>Georgians</name> have been as active in their preparations as the <rs n="Carolinian" type="group">Carolinians</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>But of that we know nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>All that appears is that <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, the often threatened, is still to flourish under the <rs>Confederate</rs> flag. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/> From <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> it is sufficient to say that there is no news.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>It is now several weeks since the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> expedition was defeated in a battle hardly less bloody than that at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>In the meantime the <rs>Confederates</rs>, delivered from apprehensions in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, have been able to concentrate a great army for the defence of this stronghold, which to judge from the emphatic language of <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00085" reg="mostcommon:Davis,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, they purpose to defend to the last extremity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>On the other hand, the <rs>Federal</rs> army has been largely reinforced and the conflict of promises almost to rival in its dimensions the siege of Sebastapol.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>But here, also, the magnitude of the enterprise is equivocal to a Federal reverse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>It is, of course, possible, that, by a regular investment, a succession of bloody battles and a delay of army makes or <unclear></unclear> <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> may be taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>But when such immense exertions are necessary to effect to little, what must we think of the final object of the war.--the conquest of the <rs>Southern States</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>The South seems to accept a trial of strength at <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, and the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, bent on conciliating the <rs>Western States</rs>, will do its utmost to win, a victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>But, suppose <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> to be taken, what then?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>To talk of such an exploit as &#x0022;opening&#x0022; the <rs>Mississippi</rs> is to make a confusion between military and commercial ideas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>The <rs n="Fall of Vicksburg" type="battle">fall of Vicksburg</rs> may certainly, unless some other point be hold by the <rs>Confederates</rs>, open the <rs>Mississippi</rs> to flotillas of war vessels, but it is plainly impossible to open the river to trade while a hostile population exist on its banks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>Unless, then, the capture of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> lead to the subjugation of the <rs>South</rs>, we cannot see how the <rs>Northwestern States</rs> will benefit by it; and there certainly is no reason to expect that any vast consequences would ensue from the free passage of a few gunboats up and down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>But whatever may be the hopes or designs of the belligerents, the operations do not advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>The latest news is that the canal which has been cut through the tongue of land opposite <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> is a failure, by which we presume that the water is not deep enough to float the gunboats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>As the river is now at its fullest, and will fall with the advance of spring, it may be predicted that the ingenious scheme for avoiding the fortress will prove of little service to the invaders. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/> The most remarkable part of the intelligence which we publish to-day is, however, the new Conscription bill which has been hurried through Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>As the days of the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> majority are numbered, and this very <date value="05-04">4th of March</date> sees many of the most warlike Representatives sent back to private life, the extravagance of their proceedings seems to have increased with the near prospect of Democratic ascendancy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>A week or <num value="2">two</num> ago we heard of a bill for enlisting <num value="300000">300,000</num> negroes; in other words, for raising an army out of a population which does not exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>This notable project has, for aught we know, become law; but, extravagant as it was, it hardly exceeds the new bill for the enrollment and conscription of the entire population of the <rs>Federal States</rs>--of every male in the dominions of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00086" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>Everybody, it seems, is liable to serve &mdash; members of Congress like private individuals, clergymen like laymen &mdash; the <rs>Governors</rs> of States alone excepted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>Every <num value="1">one</num> between <num value="20">20</num> and <num value="45">45</num> is to be put under the power of the local <rs type="role" reg="Provost Marshal">Provost Marshal</rs>, and may at any time within <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> be called upon to serve for <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> or during the war. This is certainly taking a lesson from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>But there is a great difference between a nation which is fighting for its existence and <num value="1">one</num> which is fighting to fix its yoke on others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>We can well understand that the faction which has so long ruled at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> should in its last hours endeavor to prolong as much as possible its influence in the country by legislating for <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> in advance; but the people who have already pronounced against it will probably not submit unresistingly to its provisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>Indeed, in the <rs>Western States</rs> there is so much independence of the <rs>Washington Government</rs> as to give some ground for the reports that a Northwestern Confederacy is being planned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>Thus, amid doubt, disappointment, suspicion, and wrangling, the <rs>North</rs> is drifting helplessly onward, and no man or body of men seem to have either the capacity to conduct the war or the courage to bring it to a close. </p> </div3>
