<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>There is something affecting, grand, and sublime in the magnificent courage of these heroes &mdash; a courage which not only scorns the perils of the battle-field, but is proof against the unmanly croaking at home of men who have never yet heard a bullet whistle, but have been living in security and plenty during the whole of the war. It is a humiliating truth that the only sections of the country in which repining, disloyalty, and treason have found utterance are the most remote from the seat of hostility and danger, whose people have never been disturbed even by raids, who have been making money out of refugees, and out of everybody and everything else which could be turned into gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>With these exceptions, and others who have managed to find exemption from the toils and perils of the strife, there is a universal determination never to make any terms except entire and eternal separation and independence from an infernal foe. But, of all classes of our countrymen, none are so uncompromising as the men of the army &mdash; the men who have made the most sacrifices, and endured all the hardships and perils of the war. The Southern army is in fact the <rs>Southern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>It contains the cream of the chivalry, the patriotism, the physical stamina, and the moral worth of the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>If we desire to find the only infallible exponent of the spirit and purpose of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, we must look to the army, and its universal voice is that it would prefer death to the last man to life and subjugation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/> Never was there a body of men anywhere which more fully realized than this army that life is of no value without honor and independence; that the few years' of man's stay upon earth &mdash; few at the utmost &mdash; would better be cut short in the path of duty than protracted in a miserable existence of woe and humiliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>The army &mdash; the always valiant and always victorious army &mdash; which has suffered and dared so much, proclaims itself ready to suffer and dare a <num value="1000">thousand</num> fold more rather than discolor its bright banners with the shame of submission and conquest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>If these disconsolate stayers at home will not fight, let them at least cease from groaning, wailing, predicting all manner of evil, and dimming with their despondent breath the bright mirror in which brave men only see the lineaments of hope and victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>What shall be said of Southern men who have not as much confidence and determination after <num value="10">ten</num> victories as the <rs>North</rs> after <num value="10">ten</num> defeats?
