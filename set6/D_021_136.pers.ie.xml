<head>The War in the <rs>Southwest</rs>.<lb/>[<hi rend="italics">from our army correspondent</hi>]</head> <opener> <dateline> <name type="place">Corinth,</name> <date value="1862-05-26">May 26, 1862.</date> </dateline> </opener> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> In pursuance of a <rs n="General Order" type="misc">general order</rs> issued <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> ago, the correspondents of the press now in the army have been tabooed from the lines, and ordered not to return within <measure n="25miles" type="distance">twenty-five miles</measure> of the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>This will therefore be my last letter from this point, though my convictions of duty to your readers will induce me to remain in the vicinity and chronicle such events as may drift towards me from the now boiling cauldron of army life. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The merits or demerits of this demonstration against the liberties of the press, it is not my intention to discuss now. An ample opportunity will be afforded in the future when those who are at the bottom of the affair will be treated according to their just deserts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> No cause is assigned for the movement, and none that is reasonable exists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Every telegraphic dispatch is approved officially by the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant-General</rs>, and if any improper information has been given to the public, it has been done with official sanction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>I learnt however, that <num value="1">one</num> of the correspondents was imprudent in writing a letter wherein certain movements were made public which it was desirable should be concealed, not only because of the information it gave to the enemy of <hi rend="italics">facts that had transpired,</hi> but from a desire to hide from the world the additional fact that there had been a failure to accomplish a certain object; not, however, resulting from the knowledge or strength of the enemy, but from certain natural obstacles which were unknown to our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> Other reasons may have induced this summary action; but why the sins of <num value="1">one</num> individual should be visited upon the entire representatives of the press and the people, to whom they bear the relation of mediums of communication from their relatives and friends in the army, is a mystery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>I remember that our worthy <rs type="role2">President</rs> scouted at the idea of tampering with the liberties of the press when the idea was suggested in Congress, as long as the press remained loyal and prudent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Yet here is a direct interference And farther, I have been informed by <num value="1">one</num> of the officials that he intends to arrest every editor in the country who dares to publish any private intelligence that reflects upon the movements or organization of the army or any of its officials.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Your true, well informed, and prudent correspondent, will never publish such facts, and others bearing upon the welfare of the army; but in future the country will be flooded with the most absurd tales that ever deceived a people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/><num value="1">One</num> thing is certain, distinguished officers will no longer have their horses shot under them and their names blazoned in print.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Paper <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, <q>&#x0022;riding through the thickest of the fire,&#x0022;</q> will no longer exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Official reports may give the skeleton, but the details of a battle will never reach the public eye. Instances of individual bravery will hereafter never make glad the hearts of the <rs>Southern</rs> people that the days of chivalry yet linger with us, and the wounded and dead will He and rot for weeks before their distant friends can be relieved of the agonizing suspense which follows every battle &mdash; all of which facts have heretofore been the them<unclear></unclear> of the faithful, hard-working, plodding <q>&#x0022;army correspondent.&#x0022;</q> Individually we don't care.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>We are banished, <q>&#x0022;but what's banished but set free.&#x0022;</q> The people will be the only sufferers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> As regards general <unclear>affairs,</unclear> everything remains in a quiescent attitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>A determined attack has recently been made on <placeName key="tgn,6002083" n="1.000 95" reg="fort pillow, lauderdale, tennessee">Fort Pillow</placeName>, and a fight is pending at <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>These <num value="2">two</num> events, should they prove successful to the <rs>Federal</rs> arms, may change the policy of <persName n="Halleck,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Halleck,H.,W.,,"><surname>Halleck</surname></persName> with reference to the coming battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The opening of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> would enable him to throw a heavy body of troops into <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>, and thence upon the left of <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Beauregard,Gen,,,"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>In fact, the <rs>Federal General</rs> is reported to have remarked that he would take <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName> without firing a gun. It may, therefore, be his design to await the demonstrations on the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>These are the only contingencies on which he can depend to carryout the programme thus enunciated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The probabilities of a Federal success on the river is somewhat in their favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>According to the latest accounts, a strong force has landed at <placeName reg="Osceola, Mississippi, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009144">Osceola</placeName>, which is near the point where the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> gunboats are stationed, and are now pushing down the river-bank on a road which will carry them to a point be low <placeName key="tgn,2101174" n="1.000 5" reg="randolph, tipton, tennessee">Fort Randolph</placeName>, which is about <measure n="16miles" type="distance">sixteen miles</measure> this side of <placeName key="tgn,6002083" n="1.000 95" reg="fort pillow, lauderdale, tennessee">Fort Pillow</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>In other words, it is a repetition of the <placeName reg="Island Number Ten, New Madrid, Missouri" key="tgn,2552260">Island No.10</placeName> tactic, which caused an evacuation and surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Once fairly established on the banks, the <rs>Federal</rs> will bring down their heavy guns, and, by cutting off supplies, compel us to yield to starvation and to the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> I am not disposed to regard the opening of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> an event so certain as many anticipate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Federal gunboats may, indeed, ply between <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName> and New Orleans, but it would require half a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men to protect the transports from the deadly fire of the <num value="1000">thousands</num> of independent sharpshooters and partisans who will line the banks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>It will be no easy matter to prevent a discharge of grape shot at every landing that will riddle the wooden steamers and their valuable cargoes, and this in itself constitutes an elephantine obstacle which the <rs>Federal</rs> cannot possibly surmount.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The fall of <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName> and <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> no more effects the general result than the capture of New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>They may be made <hi rend="italics">points d'appal</hi> for the operation of Federal armies, but each city will itself require an army to maintain its subordination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/><num value="1">One</num> company of riflemen following their transports, and dodging among the trees and swamps, could do more damage in a month to their river trade than a year of Federal operations on land would compensate; and if I have not misapprehended the temper of the people, it will be done. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> Affairs in <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName> look equally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are overrunning the <rs>State</rs> and advancing southward, but the people are aroused and meeting them wherever they can. Cotton is being freely burned, and everything that is valuable to the enemy placed beyond reach. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> A telegraphic dispatch from <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> advises us that the gunboats have commenced to shell the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Several privates residences have been damaged, but the batteries remain uninjured and nobody is hurt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> Of <num value="1">one</num> thing let your readers rest assured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The policy of concentration adopted by the <rs>President</rs> is destined to work out glorious results; and whatever may be the effect of military movements on the popular mind now, ultimately it will redound to our success &mdash; Overrun we can never be. Subjugation is impossible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The banks of <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName> have <q>&#x0022;travelled,&#x0022;</q> or, to use the new word loaned us by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, <q>&#x0022;Straddled.&#x0022;</q> <unclear></unclear> </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>They are all known as skilful soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>The would all make <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> rate officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>The term of service is to be <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>, unless sooner discharged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>The battalion is to do all the duties of soldiers within the limits above mentioned. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/> There is scarcely a citizen in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> who does not see the necessity of some such organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>And if it be done at all, it ought to be done promptly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>Order must be kept at home, while our army is in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>There are many excellent soldiers among us, who by age are exempted from going into the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>Here is a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> rate opportunity for all such.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>There are many others, who do not wish to leave the city, but are willing to serve in defence of it. Here is a chance for them.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/> We had been disposed until recent occurrences to think highly of this man as an officer and a gentleman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>His treatment of the prisoners taken at <placeName reg="Rich Mountain, Randolph, West Virginia" key="tgn,2616904">Rich Mountain</placeName> was said to have been humane and liberal, and in marked contrast with the brutality of other <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>To be sure, we could not reconcile with our notions of an honorable man a compact to retain his salary as <rs type="role" reg="President">President</rs> of a <orgName n="Railroad Company" type="company">railroad company</orgName> while he was commanding the army of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>We thought it a little inconsistent, also, that he should be leading such an army against the <rs>South</rs> while he was declaring in private that he would much rather lead an army against <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>But we were willing to overlook all this, in consideration of the liberality to which we have alluded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/> We are now satisfied that we gave him a credit to which he is not entitled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>His lying dispatches to his master at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> prove him to be no better than <persName n="Wool,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00054" reg="mostcommon:Wool,nomatch:0"><surname>Wool</surname></persName> and <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00055" reg="nearbymention:Butler,Gen,,,"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>From the field at <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName>, where <num value="30000">thirty thousand</num> of his men were routed by <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of their number, losing <num value="11">eleven</num> guns and <measure n="800" type="prisoners">800 prisoners</measure>, he wrote that he had gained a great victory!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>From <placeName reg="Seven Pines, Carroll, Mississippi" key="tgn,2653139">Seven Pines</placeName>, where our men, with only half his force, routed his troops, captured their batteries, seized their camps, and drove them <hi rend="italics">pell mell</hi> into the swamp, where the intervention of night alone saved them from utter destruction, he again wrote that he was victorious!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>These are the tricks of a vulgar braggart, not of a great General.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>They are designed, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, to impose on the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>; next, to impose on <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>But lying proclamations cannot long impose either on <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> or <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>People will begins to ask, if he is always victorious, why he does not press on our army and annihilate it at a blow. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/> It is said, we know not with what truth, that a battalion of negroes has been organized in <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName> by his orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>Yet, before the war, he pretended to be as violently opposed to abolitionism as any man in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>It is well-known, that as he came along from the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs> the slaves were everywhere taken by his men and carried off by his orders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>The war he has made upon us, is such a war as pirates and buccaneers would <unclear>mal e,</unclear> if they should be let loose upon us. Indeed what is he but the captain of a huge horde of pirates, making war upon principles which are abhorrent alike to the custom of nations, and the law of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/> As reported for several successive days, little has occurred at the front to break upon the oppressive and unusual quiet of the lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>Every needful preparation has been made for any movement, offensive or defensive, but the impossible state of the roads precludes the possibility of active movements, should not the enemy take the initiative and force upon us &mdash; a consummation devoutly to be wished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>Skirmishing of some king, either with sharp- shooters of artillery, goes on every day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/> Yesterday morning <orgName type="regiment" key="1Company"><persName n="Squires,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.01076" reg="mostcommon:Squires,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Squires</surname></persName>'s 1st Company</orgName> of the <orgName n="Washington Artillery" type="artillery">Washington Artillery</orgName>, together with <orgName n="MD battery"><persName n="Andrews,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.01077" reg="mostcommon:Andrews,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Andrews</surname></persName>'s Maryland battery</orgName>, and some places of <orgName n="command"><persName n="Lee,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.01078" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s command</orgName>, engaged the enemy's batteries across the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/>After a fight of nearly <measure n="3hours" type="date">three hours</measure> the enemy withdrew, having suffered a loss of <num value="1">one</num> caisson exploded and several men and horses killed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/> Later in the day <persName n="Squires,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.01079" reg="mostcommon:Squires,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Squires</surname></persName> moved a section of his battery to a point commanding the river, where a regiment of the enemy was engaged in building a pontoon bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>The section opened fire upon them with spherical case and cannister, driving them from their work in confusion, and killing and wounding a large number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>In the evening the battery shelled a house <measure n="600yards" type="distance">six hundred yards</measure> from <persName n="Garnett,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.01080" reg="mostcommon:Garnett,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Garnett</surname></persName>'s, used by the enemy as an outpost for their pickets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>Falling to set it on fire, <persName n="Owen,Lieutenant,E.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.01081" reg="default:Owen,E.,,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Owen</surname></persName>, of the <orgName n="Washington Artillery" type="artillery">Washington Artillery</orgName>, Volunteered to take a squad of men and burn it. About a dozen of the <orgName type="regiment" key="MS18">Eighteenth Mississippi</orgName> accompanied him, and started at a double-quick towards the enemy's lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>Arriving at the house, <persName n="Owen,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.01082" reg="nearbymention:Owen,E.,,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Owen</surname></persName> crape in at a window and fired the staircase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>In a short time the place was reduced to ashes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>The party then retired leisurely, not receiving a shot, although within <measure n="50yards" type="distance">fifty yards</measure> of the enemy's lines, and in full view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/><persName n="Magruder,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.01083" reg="mostcommon:Magruder,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Magruder</surname></persName> complimented <persName n="Owen,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.01084" reg="nearbymention:Owen,E.,,,"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Owen</surname></persName> for his gallantry, and expressed himself gratified at the result of the adventured.--The enemy have not fired at our batteries since. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/> The state of the roads along our lines is indeed a serious matter, and in their terrible condition, from recent rains, render the duties of quartermasters and commissaries the most laborious and irksome in the army.--Yet, although much has been done by the authorities to improve the condition of things and facilitate transportation as far as practicable, a little resight and prudence could effect much more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/>As many of the usual averages of communication are cut off from a wing of the army by much water in the lower parts of the city, it would not require more than a detail of <num value="50">fifty</num> men to open others, and span the <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creeks</rs> with good temporary log bridges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/>Yet this has not been done, and consequently, what few bridges remain are over-worked, and heavily laden teems have slipped and fallen over into the ditch, blocking up the only bridge and ford which remained intact at present. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/> The roads are in a wretched condition, but could be improved, and should be for none know the moment when guns will have to cross and perhaps hurriedly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>Last Saturday it was impossible to bring up artillery early in the action, because of the roads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/>Yet it is not a very difficult or expensive matter to detail <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="300">three hundred</num> men for half day, and with trimmed logs and common earth, and a little of the superabundant mud everywhere visible, the roads would not only be passable, but practicable for all and every purpose. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/> The heavy firing on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> was a matter of much town talk and conjecture, the prevalent opinion being that it arose from a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> attack on <persName n="Drury,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.01085" reg="mostcommon:Drury,nomatch:0"><surname>Drury</surname></persName>'s bluff, but upon riding towards the line of fire, through acres of mud and innumerable sheets of water, we found the noise proceeded from an artillery dust then progressing on <placeName reg="Garrotting farm">Garrotting farm</placeName>, between some of our places and those of the enemy's battery on the north bank of the <placeName reg="Chickahominy, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1122759">Chickahominy</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>For some time past the foe have been busily erecting earthworks, from which they kept up a continual fire upon the <name>Mississippians</name> drawn up in line of battle, and picketing in the bottom. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/> The <num value="17" type="ordinal">17th</num> and <num value="18" type="ordinal">18th</num> Mississippians being nearest the enemy, their sharpshooters and artillery have paid them great attention, never failing to shell them liberally every morning and evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/>On <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct>, however, some few of cur artillerists undertook to reply, and accordingly <num value="2">two</num> pieces from the <rs>Louisiana</rs> <orgName type="regiment" key="MD1">1st Maryland</orgName>, Hampton Legion, and Rewan ( <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">N. C.</placeName>) batteries, drove upon a knell near <placeName reg="Garnet's house">Garnet's house</placeName>, before a wooded hallow, and kept up such a heavy, rapid and accurate fire upon the enemy that, although reinforced to double the strength of ours, they were forced to retreat to the woods, leaving many dead and wounded, which we saw conveyed from the field on stretchers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>Our position being accurately known to the enemy, we did not take the caissons into action, the limbers alone advancing, so that when short of ammunition <num value="2">two</num> other pieces advanced to the others retired, thus keeping up a continual and exciting movement, highly exhilarating and beautiful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/>The fire on both sides was very accurate, but so hotly were the foe replied to that a flag of trace was been waving, as if for a cessation of hostilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/>This was disregarded, however, as their only object was to gain time and bring up heavier and more numerous pieces than ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>After about <measure n="90minutes" type="date">ninety minutes</measure> cannonade, all subdued into quiet again along the line, cur loss being <num value="1">one</num> horse killed, <measure n="2" type="wounded">two wounded</measure>, and <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> slightly wounded by fragments of shells among the artillerymen, and <num value="1">one</num> of the <orgName type="regiment" key="MS15">15th Mississippi</orgName> slightly in the month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/><placeName reg="Garnett's house">Garnett's house</placeName> is very much shaken &mdash; a shell having entered the roof and exploded in the passage, destroying every pane of class in the dwelling, and rendering it unsafe for the sick of the brigade encamped around these. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/> In regard to the particular active of <num value="1">one</num> of the batteries (<orgName n="NC Battery"><persName n="Bowan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.01086" reg="mostcommon:Bowan,nomatch:0"><surname>Bowan</surname></persName>'s North Carolina Battery</orgName>,) we learn through a communication, that they were ordered with <num value="4">four</num> pieces into the tailor, when some of the other guns were withdrawn and nearly all the time engaged instanced the fire of every gun the enemy had <q>&#x0022;in battery&#x0022;</q>--the greater portion being of pry heavy calibre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>The men of the battery behaved themselves with the greatest coolness and bravery under the terrible fire &mdash; exposed, too, from the position they were placed it, on the top of a hill enfiladed on all sides by the enemy's batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>The injuries sustained by the battery, although very slight in the time engaged, was greater than any other battery in the action--<num value="1">one</num> horse killed another half his head shot away, and <measure n="2" type="wounded">two wounded</measure> beyond recovery &mdash; total, <num value="4">four</num> horses killed and wounded.&#x0022; </p>
