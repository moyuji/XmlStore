<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>The existence of such people does not at all astonish us nor even that they are to be found in our midst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>We were quite prepared to see men, who had abetted a mob on the <date value="1861-04-19">19th of April, 1861,</date> change sides and call lustily for the blood of that same mob on the <date value="05-19">19th of May</date> following.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>We expected nothing better of them, and were not disappointed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>When law and liberty are again uppermost they will, doubtless, be found navigating in an opposite direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>When that time comes, as come it will, we look to behold them, with faces innocent of shame, obtruding themselves upon the company of honest men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/> There is class of men, however, found supporting the present Administration, and upholding its very worst acts of tyranny, who are justly amenable to a higher and severer standard of judgment than can be fairly applied to those to whom, self-abasement is an easy because a natural refuge.--These reasoners rest the defence of their public conduct upon the supposed necessities of the country and the hour, and <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">salus populi lex suprema est,</hi></foreign> is their war-cry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>We would remark, however, that it is a maxim which has much oftener been heard from the lips of tyrants than patriots.--It is against its application to our own times and country, however, that we particularly object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>What is the plain <rs>English</rs> of it when applied to our present condition?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>But what really is the danger which menaces our safety?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>The separation of the <rs>South</rs> from the <rs>North</rs> is an accomplished fact, which no sane man can ignore if he would.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>Upon the part of the <rs>South</rs> the war is a war not of foreign invasion and conquest, but of self-defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>It is the <rs>Federal</rs>, and not the <rs>Confederate</rs>, States which are waging an offensive war. It is upon Southern and not upon Federal soil that the war is raging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>It is for subjugation that the <rs>Federal</rs> power is avowedly fighting, and for national existence only that the <rs>South</rs> is contending, and yet the cry is heard that it is <hi rend="italics">our</hi> life which is endangered and <hi rend="italics">our</hi> safety which is imperiled!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>Upon the same principle, we suppose, it was the life and safety of the mother country that were imperiled by the <name>Revolution</name> which accomplished our own independence.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>The most troublesome provisions of the law, in the ordinary course of business, will be the regulations in reference to the placing of stamps upon papers and documents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>The man who signs a written contract, or an appraisement of damage, must put a stamp, value <measure n="5cents" type="currency">five cents</measure>, upon every sheet or piece of paper upon which the same shall be written.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>A party drawing a check upon a bank, a draft, or an order for the payment of more than <measure n="20dollars" type="currency">$20</measure>, must place upon it a stamp valued at <measure n="2cents" type="currency">two cents</measure>. Bills or exchange, drafts, or orders for the payment of money when exceeding <measure n="20dollars" type="currency">$20</measure>, require stamps of various values, from <measure n="5cents" type="currency">five cents</measure> up to a dollar and <num value="0.5">a half</num>, where the amount in interest is <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">$500</measure>, and <measure n="1dollars" type="currency">$1</measure> additional for each <measure n="25dollars" type="currency">$25</measure> above the latter sum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>These stamps are meant to be adhesive, and placed on the documents or papers to be used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>The law says, that a failure to use such stamps where required shall render the parties who ought to have employed them subject to a penalty of <measure n="50dollars" type="currency">$50</measure>; <q>&#x0022;and such instrument, document, or paper <hi rend="italics">shall be deemed invalid and of no effect.</hi>&#x0022;</q> It seems to be intended that the stamps shall bear on their faces the names of the particular instruments for which they are intended, and such stamps shall not be available upon any other description of instruments. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/> Besides the necessity of using the stamps, the law imposes upon those who employ them the duty of <hi rend="italics">cancellation,</hi> so that the stamps cannot be torn off and again be employed for another service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>It is provided that the party who places the stamp upon the document <q>&#x0022;<hi rend="italics">shall write thereon the initials of his name, or deface the same in such a manner as to show clearly and distinctly that such stamp has been made use of, </hi> and that the same may not be again used.&#x0022;</q> There is a penalty of <measure n="50dollars" type="currency">$50</measure> upon every <num value="1">one</num> who uses a stamp without obliterating or canceling it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>Such stamps are to be so affixed upon each box, bottle or package, that in opening the same or using the contents the stamp shall be torn or destroyed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/> Forgery of stamps is punishable by a fine of <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">$1,000</measure> and imprisonment at hard labor not exceeding <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure>. The same severe punishment is denounced against any person who shall fraudulently tear, out off, or take a stamp from any paper upon which it has been placed for use, with the intention of using it again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>The acceptance or payment of bills of exchange, drafts, promissory notes, or orders for the payment of money, which are not stamped, makes the offender liable to a fine of <measure n="200dollars" type="currency">$200</measure>. Foreign bills of exchange, payable in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, cannot be paid before the stamp is affixed, under a penalty of <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">$100</measure> against the party who pays. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>They were flatly and unequivocally rejected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/> I will commence this paper with some minor matters expecting to be able to close with more important ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>Take, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> trivial, but pleasant incidents connected with the late engagements near <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 9" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>A certain gentleman, (who, by the way, had passed the pickets by showing a receipt for his year's subscription to a newspaper,) returning from <num value="1">one</num> of the battle- fields, and going through the estate of <persName n="Allen,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00132" reg="nearbymention:Allen,William,,,"><roleName n="Major">Maj.</roleName> <surname>Allen</surname></persName>, happened to get into conversation with <num value="1">one</num> of the negro men belonging to the place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>During the interview the gentleman saw <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00133" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> and <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00134" reg="nearbymention:Lee,S.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> approaching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>Said he to the servant, <q>&#x0022;would you like to see <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00135" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> and <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00136" reg="nearbymention:Lee,S.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>!&#x0022;</q> <q>&#x0022;Yes, massa.&#x0022;</q> The gentleman, then, at some length, and with great simplicity, endeavored to explain who and what they were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>He told the negro that the <rs>President</rs> was the head man of our whole Southern country, and that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00137" reg="nearbymention:Lee,S.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> had planned and superintended all the late battles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>When all this had been done, the negro inquired, <q>&#x0022;Does they belong to <hi rend="italics">my master's</hi> company?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/> The next story is of <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00138" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, of whom they tell a legion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>He is said to be, under ordinary circumstances, inclined to take &#x0022;cat naps,&#x0022; and before and during the late battles around <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 9" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> he took little regular slumber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/><num value="1">One</num> evening, as he was riding with a single companion, he was observed to be asleep and to be nodding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>His companion wondered, but did not wake him. Presently they passed a man lying on the roadside, who cried out, <q> &#x0022;Hallow, where did that man get that liquor?&#x0022;</q> This woke <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00139" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, who said, <q> &#x0022;Well, I think I'd better keep awake now.&#x0022;</q> I tell the tale as it was told to me. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/> Well, I have waited some days since writing the foregoing, and the important matters expected, though constantly promising to unfold themselves, have not yet transpired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>I conclude, therefore, not to delay giving you what I can. For more than a week after reaching this upper country again, <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00140" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> rested and drilled his men, and had them paid off and clothed, all with the happiest effects on their spirits, which had already been visibly improved by getting in sight of the mountains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>Could there now be some improvement in the <name>Commissariat</name>, it would add much to the cheerfulness and efficiency of the men. But I speak the truth when I say that they are anxious to meet <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00141" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName> and his minions, and confident of inflicting the chastisement so richly deserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>For some days past there has been prospects of an encounter, and on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> last, as you have heard, a brisk skirmish occurred at <placeName reg="Orange, Virginia" key="tgn,7014299">Orange Court-House</placeName>, in which only our cavalry were engaged, and which, owing either to mismanagement or to that bad luck which sometimes attends the best schemes, resulted unfavorable to us. On our side there were about <measure n="10" type="wounded">10 wounded</measure> and <measure n="15" type="taken prisoners">15 taken prisoners</measure>. It is believed the loss of the enemy in killed and wounded was not less, at least, than ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>The enemy were in ambush, and greatly outnumbered us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/> A few days since I made a flying trip to <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName> and the surrounding valley.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>I found none of the apprehension which <num value="1">one</num> of the <orgName n="Richmond Papers" type="newspaper">Richmond papers</orgName> represented to exist there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>On the contrary, never were people more quiet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>It was delightful to exchange for a season that sense of scarcity which <num value="1">one</num> has about <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 9" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, and even in this region, for the sense of plenty which prevails in the <rs type="place">Upper Valley</rs> <num value="1">One</num> there can eat butter and eggs, and tenderloin, and vegetables, and milk and honey, without feeling guilty of pecuniary suicide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>The crops of <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName> are magnificent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>Never was there such a grass year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>A lady, who thought <orgName n="cavalry"><persName n="Ashby,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00142" reg="mostcommon:Ashby,nomatch:0"><surname>Ashby</surname></persName>'s cavalry</orgName> had ruined her hay, told me she would make a splendid crop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>I don't wonder the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> would like to get <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName>, and that the people there don't want them to do it. The people about <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName> heard the firing of the fight below <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 9" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> &mdash; heard it as distinctly as they did that at <placeName reg="Cross Keys, Rockingham, Virginia" key="tgn,2268788">Cross Keys</placeName>, which was only <measure n="16miles" type="distance">16 miles</measure> off &mdash; and, what is more, detected the retreat of the enemy by the change of direction of the sound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>The sound of the cannon was also heard at <placeName key="tgn,2112810" n="1.000 32" reg="mcdowell, highland, virginia">McDowell</placeName>, some <measure n="30miles" type="distance">30 miles</measure> farther west; but it was not heard at <placeName reg="Beaver Dam, Dodge, Wisconsin" key="tgn,2120707">Beaver Dam</placeName>, in <placeName reg="Hanover, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2112147">Hanover</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>How do you philosophers account for this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>I will give hypothesis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>The sound tends upwards to a plane where the atmosphere is rarer and more favorable to transmission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>On this plane it travels horizontally, thus passing above the lower country and approaching the earth as it reaches the higher lands. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/> Perhaps you have heard enough of the doings of <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00143" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>Certainly enough has been told to fire every heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>But let me place on record <num value="1">one</num> more item.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>A party of his men, going to the house of <persName n="Taliaferro,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00144" reg="mostcommon:Taliaferro,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Taliaferro</surname></persName>, and failing to find the object of their search, proceeded to pillage and insult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>They stole bedding and female clothing, they derisively put <rs type="role">Mrs.</rs> T.'s bonnet on <num value="1">one</num> of their horses, and finally took the rings from her fingers, which they distributed among the negro women, retaining for themselves a valuable <rs n="diamond ring" type="product">diamond ring</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>And against such men <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00145" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName> will grant no guard!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>Aye, he will set them on, and give them license to their foul deeds! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/> By the way, our old U. S. officers, who have always been ready, till lately, to defend <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00146" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> as a soldier and gentleman, at once say that <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00147" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName> is neither.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>In the old service, he distinguished himself on the overland route to the <rs>Pacific</rs> by sinking artesian wells and Government money to the amount of a <measure n="1000000dollars" type="currency">million dollars</measure>. <num value="1">One</num> well was finally abandoned incomplete, and afterwards a perennial spring by other parties in the immediate vicinity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>But, doubtless, the <rs>General</rs> made a good thing of it. He, in a letter to <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00148" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName n="Jefferson">Jeff.</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, then <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, urging this route, and the haring these wells, made himself the especial champion of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>How strangely this letter would sound now. I have not seen the fact stated, that his grandparents' family lived near <placeName reg="Frederick Hall depot">Frederick Hall depot</placeName>, on the <rs>Central</rs> road. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/> I have just paid a visit to <placeName key="tgn,7013956" n="1.000 18" reg="montpelier, washington, vermont">Montpelier</placeName>, the home and grave of <persName n="Madison,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00149" reg="nearbymention:Madison,James,,,"><surname>Madison</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>It is <num value="1">one</num> of the most beautiful places I have ever seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>The dwelling is of large dimensions, but of such exquisite proportions, and in such a magnificent park of stately trees, that till <num value="1">one</num> enters it he regards it rather as a modest cottage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>Covered with cream colored stucco, and the porch embowered by running roses, it presents a truly lovely picture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>It has none of that mouldering air of age which are so pleasing and painful at <placeName reg="Mount Vernon, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111632">Mount Vernon</placeName> and <placeName reg="Monticello, Albemarle, Virginia" key="tgn,7014098">Monticello</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>Such is the nature of the grounds that you do not see the mansion till you are upon it. Then, from the front a wide and glorious panorama bursts on the view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>Woods, fruitful fields, and the encircling <placeName reg="Blue Ridge, Botetourt, Virginia" key="tgn,2110717">Blue Ridge</placeName>, combine to make a scene of exquisite beauty and grandeur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>Within the dwelling nearly all is modern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>The present proprietor is <persName n="Carson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00150" reg="mostcommon:Carson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">a Mr.</roleName> <surname>Carson</surname></persName>, from <persName n="Ireland,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00151" reg="mostcommon:Ireland,nomatch:0"><surname>Ireland</surname></persName>, who lately came here under a pass from old <persName><foreName>Abe</foreName></persName>, and now proclaims strict neutrality, and claims the protection of the <rs>British</rs> flag. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/> The grave of the patriot sage is situated in the midst of a large field of luxuriant corn, is imperfectly shaded by <num value="5">five</num> tall locusts, and is surrounded by a low brick wall, which also encloses several other tombs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>The stone which covers <placeName reg="Madison, Morgan, Georgia" key="tgn,2023538">Madison</placeName>'s tomb is a simple granite shaft, bearing only this inscription: <q>&#x0022;<persName n="Madison,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00152" reg="nearbymention:Madison,James,,,"><surname>Madison</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>Immediately in the rear is a smaller shaft of white marble, containing these words: <q>&#x0022;In memory of <persName n="Payne,,Dolley,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00154" reg="default:Payne,Dolley,,,"><foreName>Dolley</foreName> <surname>Payne</surname></persName>, wife of <persName n="Madison,,James,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00155" reg="default:Madison,James,,,"><foreName>James</foreName> <surname>Madison</surname></persName>.
