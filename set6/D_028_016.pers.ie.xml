<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> The profound misery that must overwhelm the <rs>Confederate</rs> people, if subjugated by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, needs no coloring from the pencil of imagination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Deprivation of property is the least of its evils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Political and social ostracism, dispossession from the rights of freemen and the homes of childhood, agonizing as they are, are not the greatest of human calamities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The daily gibes and scoffs of their conquerors from the press, the pulpit, and in daily intercourse, sharp and annoying as the incessant crawling and stings of vermin, may be endured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>But to see not only their country gone, and gone forever, but its ideas, customs, social and moral characteristics, all that constituted it the high souled, genial, generous South, supplanted by <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> notions and habits, so that nothing of the <rs>South</rs> remains save its inanimate nature, is an affliction compared with which the grave would be hailed as a blessing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The loyal sons of this heroic land would sooner see it upheaved from its foundations by some convulsion of nature, and buried in the <rs>Atlantic</rs>, than to behold its national characteristics submerged by a tide of <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> manners, selfishness and fanaticism. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> Yet, even in this dire extreme of human misery, there would remain some alleviation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>In the bottom of this deep abyss some rays of consolation would fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>It is not so deep that we cannot look up from it and behold some stars still shining in the overhanging sky.--The names of the great souls whom we have given to this struggle will still remain as beacon lights to cheer and animate the oppressed of all climes and all ages, and the memory of our superhuman struggles and sacrifices will flame across the firmament and throw a ruddy blaze into the surrounding darkness.--There is no anguish like that of self-reproach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Hell, of all its tormentors, has no friend like that of Remorse.--From its sharp fangs the loyal son of the <rs>South</rs> will be always free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>There is no dishonor in any human calamity if the sufferer did not bring it upon himself.--Calamities, not thus entailed, may be borne with resignation and fortitude, as the will of Him who knows what is best for his creatures, and who chastens those whom He loves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> But there is a lower deep of humiliation than any the <rs>South</rs> can suffer at <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>They cannot deprive us of self-respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>But what must be the sensations of those native-born sons of the <rs>South</rs>, those children whom she has nurtured at her own bosom, who have not only deserted her in her hour of need, but have given their active aid, upon field and flood, to the desolation and subjugation of their native home?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>What must be the feelings of that large number of Southern-born man, the <name>Scotts</name>, Farraguts, <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,nomatch:0"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName>'s, and others, who clung to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> service after separation because they could thereby promote their personal ambition, and have given their entire talents, energies and labors to the overthrow of their own people and the destruction of the property and institutions of the <name>States</name> which gave them birth?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>We do not mention <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Hunter,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><surname>Hunter</surname></persName></hi> in this connection, for we are speaking of men who may be supposed, amidst all the crimes, to possess some of the ordinary sensibilities of human nature; who, if guilty, are not destitute of all conscience; not of that <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Hunter,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><surname>Hunter</surname></persName></hi> <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> who hung <persName n="Creigh,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Creigh,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Creigh</surname></persName>, and whom the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <persName n="Averill,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Averill,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Averill</surname></persName> and other <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> officers in vain endeavored to dissuade from deeds of hideous cruelty.--We are speaking of men, not monsters. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> To say that we respect the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> invaders more than such men, to say that history will give those <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> a niche not as low as Southern Renegades, is but feebly to express the loathing which they will entertain for themselves should they ever succeed in their <hi rend="italics">role</hi> of hired assassins and strangle the mother that gave them birth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Thus much may be said for <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>: that they honestly believed the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> <num value="1">one</num> country, and <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName> as much a part of their own land as <placeName reg="Maine" key="tgn,7007515">Maine</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>And thus much could, with equal truth, be said of the <rs>South</rs>: that it as honestly believed the <rs>Union</rs> a league of Sovereign and Independent States, and that to the <rs>State</rs>, not the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, the <rs>Supreme Allegiance</rs> of its citizens was due. We are not discussing the question of which was right, but speaking simply of an undeniable fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>That fact being so, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> might, with sincerity, maintain their ideas by the sword, ignorant as the masses were of the refusal of the <rs>Convention</rs> that framed the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> to bestow upon the <rs>General Government</rs> the power of coercion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>But what can be said of Southern-born men, raised amid a society where no <num value="1">one</num> doubted the <name>Sovereignty</name> of the <name>States</name>, or the duty of their people, if the <rs>General Government</rs> should ever usurp the power of the sword denied to it by the framers of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, to resist with the whole strength of their arm and the best blood in their veins; of men, thus trained, who, to keep their places in the <orgName n="U. S. Army" type="org">United States Army</orgName> and Navy, to obtain promotion, to command large armies, and sail in large ships, with the flag of an Admiral at the masthead, become the tools and slaves of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> for the subjugation and ruin of their own country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The <rs>Swiss</rs>, who sold their swords to any power of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> that would buy them, never sold their swords to invade their own mountains.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> In forwarding to me the resolutions introduced into the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName></orgName> by <persName n="Stephens,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Stephens,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stephens</surname></persName>, of <persName n="Hancock,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="mostcommon:Hancock,nomatch:0"><surname>Hancock</surname></persName>, you state that you are not inclined to favor the passage of these or any similar resolutions, believing them to have a tendency to create divisions among ourselves and to unite and strengthen our enemies; but that it is asserted in <placeName key="tgn,2023617" n="1.000 65" reg="milledgeville, baldwin, georgia">Milledgeville</placeName> that I favor such action on the part of the <name>States</name>, and would be pleased to see <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> cast her influence in that way. You are kind enough to say that if this be true, and if the passage of these or similar resolutions would, in the slightest degree, aid or assist me in bringing the war to a successful and speedy close, you will give them your earnest and hearty support. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> I return to you my cordial thanks for this expression of confidence, but assure you that there is no truth in the assertions which you mention; and I presume that you will already have seen by the closing part of my annual message, which must have reached you since the date of your letter, that I have not contemplated the use of any other agency in treating for peace than that established by the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/> That agency seems to me to be well adapted to its purpose, and free from the injurious consequences that would follow any other means that have been suggested. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/> The objection to separate State action which you present in your letter appears to be so conclusive as to admit no reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>The immediate and inevitable tendency of such distinct action by each State is to create discordant instead of united counsels; to suggest to our enemies the possibility of a dissolution of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and to encourage them, by the spectacle of our divisions, to more determined and united action against us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/> They would readily adopt the false idea that some of the <name>States</name> of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> are disposed to abandon their sister States and make separate terms of peace for themselves; and if such a suspicion, however unfounded, were once engendered among our own people, it would be destructive of that spirit of mutual confidence and support which forms our chief reliance for success in the maintenance of our cause. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/> When the proposal of separate State action was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> mooted, it appeared to me so impracticable, so void of any promise of good, that I gave no heed to the proposal; but upon its adoption by citizens whose position and ability give weight to the expression of their opinions, I was led to a serious consideration of the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>My <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> impressions have not been changed by reflection. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/> If all the <name>States</name> of the <num value="2">two</num> hostile federations are to meet in convention, it is plain that such a meeting can only take place <hi rend="italics">after</hi> an agreement as to the time, place and terms on which they are to meet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Now, without discussing the minor, although not trifling difficulties, of agreeing as to time and place, it is certain that the <name>States</name> would never consent to a convention without a previous agreement as to the <hi rend="italics">terms </hi> on which they were to meet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>The proposed convention must meet on the basis either that no State should, against its own will, be bound by the decision of the convention, or that it should be so bound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>But it is plain that an agreement on the basis that no State should be bound, without its consent, by the result of the deliberations, would be an abandonment, on the part of the <rs>North</rs>, of its pretended right of coercion; would be an absolute recognition of the independence of the several States of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>; would be, in a word, so complete a concession of the rightfulness of our cause that the most visionary cannot hope for such an agreement <hi rend="italics">in advance</hi> of the meeting of a convention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>The only other possible basis of meeting is that each State should agree, beforehand, to be bound by the decision of the convention; and such agreement is but another form of submission to Northern dominion, as we well know that in such a convention we should be outnumbered nearly <num value="2">two</num> to <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>On the very threshold of the scheme proposed, therefore, we are met by an obstacle which cannot be removed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>Is not the impracticable character of the project apparent? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/> You will observe that I leave entirely out of view the suggestion that a convention of all the <name>States</name> of both federations should be held by common consent without any previous understanding as to the effect of its decisions; should meet merely to debate and pass resolutions that are to bind no <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>It is not supposed that this can really be the meaning attached to the proposal by those <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> who are active in its support, although the resolutions to which you invite my attention declare that the function of such a convention would be simply to <hi rend="italics">propose </hi> a plan of peace, with the <hi rend="italics">consent</hi> of the <num value="2">two</num> belligerents; or, in other words, to act as negotiators in treating for peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>This part of the scheme is not intelligible to me. If the convention is only to be held with the consent of the <num value="2">two</num> belligerents, that <hi rend="italics">consent</hi> cannot be obtained without negotiation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>The plan then would resolve itself into a scheme that the <num value="2">two</num> governments should negotiate an agreement for the appointment of negotiators to make proposals for a treaty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>It seems much more prompt and simple to negotiate for peace at once than to negotiate for the appointment of negotiators, who are to meet without power to do anything but make proposals. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/> If the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> is willing to make peace, it will treat for peace directly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>If unwilling, it will refuse to consent to the convention of States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>The author of these resolutions, and those who concur in his views, appear to me to commit the radical error of supposing that the obstacle to obtaining the peace which we all desire consists in the difficulty of finding proper agencies for negotiating, so that the whole scope of the resolutions ends in nothing but suggesting that <hi rend="italics">if</hi> the enemy will treat, the best agency would be State delegates to a convention; whereas the whole and only obstacle is, that the enemy will not treat at all, or entertain any other proposition than that we should submit to their yoke, acknowledge that we are criminals, and appeal to their mercy for pardon. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/> After this statement of objections, if may appear superfluous to add others of less gravity; but as you invite a full expression of my views, I will add that history is replete with instances of the interminable difficulties and delays which attend the attempt to negotiate on great and conflicting interests when the parties to the negotiation are numerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>If this has been the case where the parties possessed full powers to conclude a treaty, what can we hope from an assemblage of negotiators from <num value="30">thirty</num> or <num value="40">forty</num> States, who, in the midst of an exasperating warfare, are to meet without power to conclude anything?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>In the history of our own country we find that in a time of profound peace, when the most cordial brotherhood of sentiment existed, and when a long and bloody war had been brought to a triumphant close, it required <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> to assemble a convention and bring its deliberations to an end, and another year to procure the ratification of their labors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>With such a war as the present in progress, the views of the large assemblage of negotiators proposed would undergo constant change according to the vicissitudes of the struggle, and the attempt to secure concordant views would soon be abandoned, and leave the parties more embittered than ever; less hopeful of the possibility of successful negotiation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/> Again, how is the difficulty resulting from the conflicting pretentious of the <num value="2">two</num> belligerents in regard to several of the <name>States</name> to be overcome?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>Is it supposed that <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> would enter into a convention with a delegation from what our enemies choose to term the &#x0022;State&#x0022; of &#x0022;<placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">West Virginia</placeName>,&#x0022; and thus recognize an insolent and violent dismemberment of her territory?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Or would the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> consent that &#x0022;<placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">West Virginia</placeName>&#x0022; should be deprived of her pretensions to equal rights, after having formally admitted her as a State, and allowed her to vote at a Presidential election?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>Who would send a delegation from <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>The enemy claim to hold the governments of those States, while we assert them to be members of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>Would delegates be received from both sides?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>If so, there would soon be a disruption of the convention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>If delegates are received from neither side, then a number of the <name>States</name> most vitally interested in the result would remain unrepresented; and what value could be attached to the mere recommendations of a body of negotiators under such circumstances?--Various other considerations suggest themselves, but enough has been said to justify my conclusion that the proposal of separate State action is unwise, impracticable, and offers no prospect of good to counterbalance its manifold injurious consequences to the cause of our country. </p> <closer> <salute>Very respectfully, yours, etc.,</salute> <lb/> <signed><persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName>  <surname>Davis</surname></persName>.</signed> </closer> </div4> </div3>
