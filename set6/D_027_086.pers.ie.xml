<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> At <time value="8oclock">eight o'clock</time> <time>yesterday</time> morning our forces advanced on the enemy's lines in front of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Fort Harrison</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>After pushing forward some distance, the enemy sent out a heavy line to meet us, and the columns met about a mile from <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Fort Harrison</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Our troops pressed their attack with great vigor, driving the opposing line in confusion back to their works, inflicting severe loss upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>On arriving at their entrenchments they made a stand, and, being well supported, our troops were brought to a stand-still, but retained their ground at last accounts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> <orgName n="Battery Harrison" type="battery">Battery Harrison</orgName> is said to be a most uncomfortable position for the enemy.--They are subjected nightly to a gunboat shelling, and during the day the inmates are regaled with round shot and shell from land batteries, while our sharp &mdash; shooters besiege them so closely that no <num value="1">one</num> dares to show his head above the parapets for fear of the deadly aim of our men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> As an instance of the fatality of the firing of our sharpshooters, we were informed by a gentleman, who was witness to the fact, that <num value="1">one</num> of them <measure n="11" type="killed">killed eleven</measure> of the enemy in <num value="1">one</num> day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> A rumor reached the city last night that we had, by a flank movement, isolated <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Fort Harrison</placeName>, and that it was now completely in our power, all communication with the main army being cut off. This, however, is doubtful, and, at least, needs confirmation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> Simultaneous with the advance above mentioned, our troops, in the vicinity of the <placeName key="tgn,2275605" n="1.000 10" reg="Darbytown, Wayne, Pennsylvania">Darbytown</placeName> road, were put in motion, and pressing on with their usual alacrity, compelled the whole line of the enemy to give way. Following up their advantage, our men continued to advance, the <rs>Federals</rs> retiring stubbornly at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, but finally breaking into a double-quick, they were soon in confusion, and abandoned in their flight <num value="9">nine</num> field pieces, which our men took possession of. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> After a brisk march of about <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure>--the enemy all the while retreating before us &mdash; we came upon their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> line of earthworks of any strength, having already passed <num value="2">two</num> temporary lines, at which the enemy made but a short stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Here, however, the entrenchments were held by fresh <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and they poured into our ranks a terrible fire from cannon and small arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Unfortunately, at this juncture, <num value="1">one</num> of our, brigades faltered, threw our line into confusion, and thus stopped our advance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> Here we lost most heavily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Charging the works with fury and dogged determination, we endeavored to regain our advantage, but in vain; and finally, falling back out of range of the enemy's guns, we established our lines <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> in advance of our position of the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The track of battle led to the right of the <rs>Darbytown</rs>, and in the direction of the <placeName key="tgn,2540359" n="1.000 8" reg="newmarket, newport news, virginia">Newmarket</placeName> road, our extreme right finally resting in front of the line of entrenchments thrown out from <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Fort Harrison</placeName>, and about a mile and <num value="0.5">a half</num> north </p> <milestone unit="column" n="3"/>
