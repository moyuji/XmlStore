<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> --We had concluded, at <num value="1">one</num> time, to let the matter rest in the hands of the parties more particularly interested, but it continues to be agitated in the <rs>Northern</rs> papers, and the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="National Intelligencer" type="newspaper">National Intelligencer</orgName>,</hi> under the immediate inspiration of <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName>, publishes a whole broadside to justify the act. We have, therefore, changed our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> resolution, and shall proceed to express still further the views which we have already indicated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>It is plain that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government does not mean to rest its cause upon the absence of instructions to <persName n="Wilkes,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Wilkes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Wilkes</surname></persName>, but that, on the contrary, it intends to back that officer to the full extent of its ability. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> According to a generally recognized principle of international law, the jurisdiction of every country over its own waters is perfect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>What are to be considered <q>&#x0022;the waters&#x0022;</q> of a country &mdash; that is, how far the jurisdiction in question extends &mdash; is still subject to discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Some writers contend for <num value="30">thirty</num> leagues, some for more, some for less.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/><hi rend="italics">On the high sea,</hi> each vessel is under the jurisdiction of the nation to which it belongs, and this so entirely <unclear></unclear> writers on international law say it is to be considered, under such circumstances, a portion of the national territory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Of course, no ship-of-war belonging to any other nation has a right to interfere with it, and all persons, as well as all property on board of it, is under the protection of its flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>These principles &mdash; certainly founded in justice &mdash; imply an absolute negation of the right of visit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>They have been often asserted by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and on <num value="1">one</num> occasion they went to war in defence of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>They have been affirmed by the courts of these same <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> as often as they have had occasion to take cognizance of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The right of visit in time of peace has, in fact, been entirely abandoned in these latter days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>It is never attempted, as far as we know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>But the right of visit in time of war is still asserted, for the very plain reason that, unless it were admitted in some form, there could be no possibility of enforcing another right dependent upon it &mdash; the right namely, to intercept contraband of war on its passage to the enemy in a neutral vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>This, however, is merely an exception to a general rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The question of prize is always decided by the courts of the country making the prize.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The present, however, is a question of a totally different character singularly enough, it commits the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to a line of action which it always reprobated on the part of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>For, during the wars with the <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> assumed and exercised the right to visit <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> ships, and removed by force, from their decks, all persons found, or even suspected, to have been born <name>British</name> subjects, while the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> not only denied the right, but went to war rather than submit to its exercise. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> Many <sic>attemps</sic> have been made within the present century to obtain a definitive settlement of the disputed right, but always without success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> doctrine is fully set forth in <persName n="Webster,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Webster,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Webster</surname></persName>'s famous letter to <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Ashburton</foreName></persName>, and in <persName n="Cass,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Cass,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Cass</surname></persName>'s protest against the ratification of the quintuple treaty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>With respect to the latter, it is well known to have produced a powerful effect in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, and, backed by a pamphlet written by <persName n="Cass,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Cass,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Cass</surname></persName> and published in <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName>, to have caused the rejection of the treaty by the <rs type="place">French Chambers</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The ground assumed both by <persName n="Webster,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Webster,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Webster</surname></persName> and <persName n="Cass,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Cass,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Cass</surname></persName>, afford no countenance to the new doctrine of <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The latter more especially would not admit the right of visit, even under the pretext of ascertaining the character of a vessel suspected of being engaged in the slave trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>He represented so powerfully the evil uses to which the right thus sought might be perverted by a great maritime power, to the ruin of all commerce but its own, as to produce a complete resolution in the public opinion of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> The present question is purely a question between the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>It has no basis either in the law of nations or the obligation of treaties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>International law leaves it in litigation, and treaties are silent on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The Federal Government and the <rs>Government</rs> of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> have changed places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Both are in opposition to themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The <num value="1">one</num> does what it has always asserted no Government had the right to do, the other suffers what its adversary always maintained it had no right to inflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/><persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> having shouldered the responsibility, it may be asked, more pertinently than before, what he meant by the act?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Perhaps he meant to abandon the position always heretofore maintained by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Perhaps he designed to drive <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> to the wall, and compel her claim of right to impress <name>British</name> seamen found on board of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> vessels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Both these suppositions have been put forth, and largely dwell upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The act itself certainly is not very encouraging to those visionaries who hope that the period will soon arrive when international morality will be brought to perfection, and when <num value="1">one</num> nation will do unto another even as it would that another should act unto it. It will not, it is to be presumed, make the <rs>British</rs> people and Government fall in love with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, nor will it arouse any very strong feeling of sympathy or affection on the part of any other <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/><persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName>, when called to account, will say that he arrested <persName n="Mason,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Mason,James,M.,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Mason</surname></persName> and <persName n="Slidell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Slidell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Slidell</surname></persName> because they were guilty of treason and rebellion, and will say that the very fact of their voyage to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> in the capacity of envoys from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> establishes their guilt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>But this, most assuredly, will not do for <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, who has already recognized the existence of a state of war in this country, acknowledged the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> as belligerents, and proclaimed her own neutrality, thus giving to Confederates and Federals an equal claim to the protection of her flag, wherever found beneath its folds on land or at sea. This neutrality, thus proclaimed, <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> may contend has been shamefully violated, by tearing passengers from a British steamer, belonging to the <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550">West India</placeName> Line, on its way home, and therefore not possible to be suspected of having contraband articles on board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>She may say, moreover that there is an extradition treaty between her and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, that the class of criminals to be given up and the forms in which the delivery is to be effected, are therein expressly designated That if <persName n="Slidell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Slidell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Slidell</surname></persName> and <persName n="Mason,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Mason,James,M.,,:1"><surname>Mason</surname></persName> come within this category, they must <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> be proved to do so, by a trial in the proper form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>That therefore, under any circumstances, such extradition could not be made at sea, where there was no officer, no court, and no jury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>That moreover the treaty expressly excepted men charged with political offences, and that the alleged offences of the <rs>Commissioners</rs> were entirely political.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>That they have tacitly abandoned, for the sake of peace, the pretensions which brought on the war of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>, and that the assumption of them by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, under the present circumstances, is an insult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> The village of <placeName reg="Occoquon">Occoquon</placeName> must have been beautiful in its day, although its present appearance is far from inviting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>It is very compactly built, and has some neat and handsome dwellings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The streets are narrow, but regular, running parallel with and towards the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The houses are placed close upon the streets, leaving no room for sidewalks, and as in some of the narrow lanes of <placeName key="tgn,7004474" n="1.000 3" reg="napoli,napoli,campania,italia,europe">Naples</placeName>, <num value="1">one</num> has to tramp along the carriage way through the mud and dirt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Formerly, I should say the place was of some importance; but now, nothing is doing, and, in fact, little has been done since the attempt to raise and <orgName n="Abolition party" type="party">abolition party</orgName> in the town during the last Presidential canvass in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>At the upper portion is a stone mill, built for a cotton factory, and below it <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> others, devoted to different manufactures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>The factory seems to be in good repair, the dam and raceway, the wheel, and the machinery inside, for spinning cotton being now just as they were some <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure> ago, when the business was suspended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>In the centre of the village is a machine and blacksmith shop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>with water power, and at its lower extremity, a tannery, if I may judge from a number of hides hanging upon its wall.--There is <num value="1">one</num> flouring mill in operation but little business is done in it on account of the difficulty of procuring grain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Before the war the occupations of the citizens of <placeName reg="Occoquon">Occoquon</placeName> were various.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>A few months since, I stood by the grave of my oldest son, who had died in the service of his country, when similar honors were paid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>I could not help dropping a tear over the grave of this soldier, who was doubtless a dutiful son, a fond, affectionate brother, a good citizen and patriot. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/> To-day I witnessed a grand and imposing scene &mdash; it was no less than the whole army in line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>This was done to assign the different regiments the positions they were to occupy whenever the enemy makes his appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>It was truly a laughable scene, and created shouts of applause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>It was <q>&#x0022;tall running,&#x0022;</q> and a few of the mimickers had long legs and made rapid and astonishing strides. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/> With your permission, I will hereafter give you a sketch of some things in camp life that I have seen while among my friends, neighbors and kinfolk, who have come up here to fight the battles of us who stay at home, and perhaps think and say, too, what lazy fellows the soldiers are. Could the grumblers come and see for themselves, as I have done, the <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> of fortifications and breast-works which the army has thrown up, they would never utter another complaint during the war. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>The rebel rear was brought up by a most determined fellow, who turned repeatedly and discharged his musket at our ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>Animated by the same personal daring, a Federal soldier rushed beyond the head of his column, firing continually.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>After the pursuit had continued for some distance, it being feared that our men were to be drawn into a trap, they were ordered to retire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>The order was obeyed by all save the volunteer who had led the advance, and before many minutes he was seen struggling with the laggard <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginian</rs>, whose own column had gone ahead. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/> Our informant adds that more reckless courage, upon both sides, was never remarked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>All consciousness of organization was for a time abandoned, and men, fighting upon their own responsibility, presumed, even in the face of death, to set examples of bravers.

<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/> --There seems to be no doubt that, whatever may be the policy of the <rs>English Government</rs>, the sympathies of the <rs>English</rs> people are with the <rs>South</rs> in the present struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>Thus much is certain, from the accounts of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> letter-writers in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and from the querulous tone of the <rs>British</rs> press.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>It is not that <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs> like slavery, but there is in the <rs>British</rs> mind an inherent love of fair play, which is called into active exercise by the present war. If there is another characteristic of <persName n="Bull,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00072" reg="default:Bull,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Bull</surname></persName> as prominent and universal as his pluck and back-bone, it is his unvarying sympathy with the smallest man in the ring, and his intense indignation and contempt at the idea of <num value="2">two</num> men setting upon <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>From the heir apparent to the coal heaver there is a vein of genuine chivalry in the <rs>British</rs> stock, which renders it impossible for a true Briton even to comprehend how a people can be so lost to shame as to exult in the idea of overpowering their enemy by sheer force of numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>To glory in the spirit which can grapple with and conquer a more powerful foe, is the instinct of genuine chivalry and valor, but it is reserved for <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> warriors to reverse the sentiment, and fire national salutes over a victory like that at <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName>, where <num value="10">ten</num> to <num value="1">one</num> was the odds necessary to secure their triumph. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/> Whatever the cause, certain it is that every mail from <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, every <name>English</name> journal, and every <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> correspondent abroad, of a Northern press, confirm the impression that the sympathies of the <rs>English</rs> people are with the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>We are not disposed to attribute this sympathy entirely to the fact that the interests of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> are interwoven with our own. Nations like men are governed by interests, but there are purer springs and higher motives than sordid and selfish love of gain and power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>If <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> is opposed to black slavery, she is still more opposed to white slavery, and cannot look with indifference upon a struggle in which all the political and civil rights and immunities the <rs>South</rs> has inherited from <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and which were purchased by the trials and perils of her best and bravest for centuries, are threatened by a colossal military despotism, which has already trampled under foot in its own section the last vestige of civil liberty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/> This is a matter of indifference that should have the sympathies of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, if we cannot have her active co-operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>We ought to be simply ashamed to depend on any-nation but ourselves for our deliverance from oppression, but such moral aid and comfort as the sympathies of civilized Christians afford may well inspire with new strength every patriot heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>It is the testimony of all mankind to the justice of <unclear> se.</unclear> It is the approving verdict of nations; who cannot be accused of partiality, but, on the contrary, have been prejudiced against us by our peculiar institutions and by the misrepresentations of them which have been scattered broadcast over <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> by our insidious foes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>For ourselves, we rejoice that so far as <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and the <rs>South</rs> are concerned, bygones are bygones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>The trifling tax which was the pretext for <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> revolt in <num value="76">76</num>, and all the other grievances trumped up for that occasion, never amounted to a thousandth part of the injustice, wrongs and crimes which the descendants of the rebels of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> have visited upon the rebels of the <rs>South</rs>. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/> --The planters upon the <rs>Southern</rs> coast, at all those points which are exposed to the depredations of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> invaders, are busily employed in removing their negroes to the interior and in burning their cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>The comparatively small quantity of the staple which has fallen into the enemy's hands could have been destroyed by the proprietors but for the confidence they felt in the ability of the slight fortifications in their neighborhood to resist attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>The success of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> in their attack upon <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName> has had a different effect from what they anticipated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>Instead of opening a port for Southern cotton, it has rendered it impossible that another bale of Southern cotton shall ever fall into their hands. --Already the work of destruction has commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>With a self-sacrificing patriotism nobler than the courage of the battle field, the planters are applying the torch to the rich product of their soil at every place where it is in danger of a visit from the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>The midnight sky on the seacoast of <placeName reg="Carolina City, Carteret, North Carolina" key="tgn,2222249">Carolina</placeName> is lighted up with the flames of the coveted treasure, and systematic arrangements have been made to convert it into ashes universally, before it shall fall into the invader's hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>All the <rs>Fire Zouaves</rs> of New York cannot extinguish this great conflagration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>The signal of their approach will be the signal for the torch to be applied, and if the strong man must fall, he will pull down the pillars of the temple upon his persecutors and bury himself and them in a common ruin. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> do not understand the spirit of the <rs>Southern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>They might as well attempt to subjugate the winds as to conquer such a people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>They have determined to sacrifice every worldly possession on the altar of independence and liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>They will never permit <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> to wring from them either their rights, or, that which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are alone fighting for, their commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>They are not themselves dependent upon cotton, valuable as it is to them, and essential to the rest of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>They can give up the cultivation of cotton altogether, and still live in comfort and plenty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>Their wonderful soil produces in boundless abundance every <unclear>va y</unclear> of agricultural production.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>They can raise more than enough of wheat, corn, rye, oats, hay, to supply their own population.--They will, in all probability, devote their soil exclusively the next year to the cultivation of the cereals, and whether the present crop shall be available for the use of the world depends entirely upon their own sovereign will and pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>The cotton is ready for the torch, and the torch is ready for the cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have proved themselves successful inventors of agricultural machines, but when they employ the sword to raise Southern staples, they make a blunder which will destroy their commerce, ruin their cities, and convert the subjugation of the <rs>South</rs>, even if it would be accomplished, into their own financed and political ruin. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>He succeeded in surprising, and, after a short struggle, capturing <num value="58">fifty-eight</num> of the enemy, belonging to the <rs>Normal Regiment</rs> of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, including <num value="1">one</num> <rs type="role2">Captain</rs> (<persName n="Elliott,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00250" reg="mostcommon:Elliott,nomatch:0"><surname>Elliott</surname></persName>) and <num value="3">three</num> <rs type="role2">Lieutenants</rs>, who had scarce time enough to run into a low stone fort which they had established, before our men at a full run broke in upon them, with the before detailed results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>Our men went to work at once collecting all the stores of the enemy, preparing them for transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>For a time the battle was evenly waged, but our men soon collected together and pushed home on them, when they fled in confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>We captured, among other things, <num value="50">50</num> muskets, <num value="45">forty-five</num> overcoats, and a number of blankets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>The prisoners were all liberated on taking the oath not to serve during the war, or until exchanged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>During the march of the infantry towards <placeName reg="Fredericktown, Madison, Missouri" key="tgn,2058830">Fredericktown</placeName>, our scouts brought in <num value="2">two</num> Federal soldiers, captured <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> beyond the town, and reported a large party after them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>We reached the place on the <dateStruct value="--17"><day reg="2">17th</day></dateStruct>, and quietly went into camp to await the return of the <rs>General</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>Early on the morning of the <dateStruct value="--18"><day reg="18">18th</day></dateStruct>, the camp was started by a quick succession of musket shots beyond the <rs type="place">St. Francis Bridge</rs>, which crosses a river of the same name <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a mile beyond the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>We soon discovered that it proceeded from our picket, which had been driven in by a large force of cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>The enemy sustained a severe loss, as the picket, which was under the command of <persName n="Holmes,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00251" reg="mostcommon:Holmes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Holmes</surname></persName>, consisted of <num value="30">30</num> men, who gave them a volley at the short distance of <measure n="60yards" type="distance">60 yards</measure>, the <rs>Captain</rs> of the little band, as the enemy came on at a dashing gallop, walked deliberately to the middle of the road, took careful aim at the leading officer, and shot him through the body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>They lost <measure n="5" type="killed">five killed</measure> and <measure n="15" type="wounded">fifteen wounded</measure>, while the picket arrived safety to camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>The enemy man&#x0153;uvred about all the morning, seeking to find out our numbers, but refrained from attacking us. The <rs>Colonel</rs> commanding our forces did not deem it advisable to assume the offensive, but await the <rs>General</rs>'s coming, he having been advised that the enemy was at hand, and each moment was expected to arrive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>About <time value="1oclock">1 o'clock</time> the <rs>General</rs> rode into camp; at the sight of him the whole brigade, though ordered not to cheer, broke out in <num value="1">one</num> long continued shout, which, astonishing to say, so appalled the enemy, that they at once commenced a hasty retreat, and from all the reports we can gather from those residing on the road, they seemed in no little confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>We made hot pursuit, but failed to come up with them; and after following several miles the whole command returned to camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>The balance of the day, and all the following, we were left in quiet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>On the morning of the <num value="20" type="ordinal">20th</num> our picket arrested a man, just as day was breaking, while endeavoring to avoid them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>They recovered a package which he had thrown away, which, on inspection, proved to be a communication from <persName n="Plummer,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00252" reg="mostcommon:Plummer,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Plummer</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Cape Girardeau, Cape Girardeau, Missouri" key="tgn,7013539">Cape Girardeau</placeName>, to the commandant at <placeName reg="Ironton, Iron, Missouri" key="tgn,2059199">Ironton</placeName>, stating that he was approaching our encampment with a large force, and asked his co-operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>Being thus warned in time, we made all the necessary arrangements to receive the enemy.--The safety of the baggage and lead <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> engaged the <rs>General</rs>'s attention, for once having secured that, he could fight or not as his pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>It was soon on the way to <placeName reg="Greenville, Greenville, South Carolina" key="tgn,7014143">Greenville</placeName>, the brigade accompanying it, but was halted <measure n="10miles" type="distance">ten miles</measure> south of the town, and here preparations were made to return with all our fighting force, to give battle to the enemy, be their numbers what they might.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>After a rest of a few hours, we started at <time value="4oclock">four o'clock</time> of the morning of the <num value="21" type="ordinal">21st</num> with but <num value="1200">1,200</num> men all told, with the expectation of giving fight to <num value="3">three</num> times our number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>We found out though, before their fire opened, that there were <num value="7">seven</num> regimental flags in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>Since then we have received reliable information that there were <num value="10000">10,000</num> men of the enemy present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>The <num value="3">three</num> <num value="6">6</num>-pounders were placed on or close adjacent to the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>After driving in their pickets, with some skirmishers, detached for that purpose, at about <time value="12oclock">12 o'clock</time> they advanced in force, and showed on the brow of a hill, which hid the town from our view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>Soon their cannon were placed in position, and sent shot and shell in quick succession among us. Our <num value="12">12</num> and little <num value="5">5</num>'s replied merrily, and caused quite a stampede among their cavalry, which had showed incautiously in masses over the hill top. Our <num value="12">12</num>-pounder several times during the action, by its well-directed discharges of grape, prevented their cavalry from making a charge down our centre upon our guns, (sixes.) During the while a regiment of their infantry advanced down the hill through the cornfield, immediately in front of <persName n="Lowe,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00258" reg="nearbymention:Lowe,Andrew,,,"><surname>Lowe</surname></persName>'s position; he lay concealed behind the fence that enclosed the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>The enemy's advance guard of <num value="1">one</num> company stopped when within <measure n="60yards" type="distance">sixty yards</measure> of our line, when, after particularly cautioning his men to shoot low and take deliberate aim, he gave the order to fire, when at least <num value="70">seventy</num> of them bit the dust.--The balance of their regiment soon took their place, but in a few minutes broke and fled to the rear of the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>Again they returned; but now <num value="2">two</num> flags, denoting <num value="2">two</num> regiments, came to the attack; but again they were compelled to give way before the deliberate and careful firing of our men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>About this time the chivalric <rs>Lowe</rs> was shot through the head, and sank to the ground without making a sign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>Though many of our men by this time were out of powder, they showed no signs of fear, and only when the <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</rs> gave the order to fall back to the woods in rear of the <num value="12">12</num>-pounder, did they move from their places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>But they did not appear in great numbers, and seemed loath to engage us at close quarters; for our men kept excellent order, and no doubt looked too formidable to be trifled with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>Let us see. <placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> stands charged with the supervision of all the interests of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>; he is required to report to Congress the condition of all these interests and the demands of every part of the public service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>The basis upon which these bills or notes will rest is precisely the same as that of the bonds of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and that is the consent of the people to be taxed to any amount necessary to redeem all the obligations of the <rs>Government</rs>, approved by their Representatives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>I am perfectly confident that they will not depreciate very much from a specie standard, from the fact that we have a combination of productions (not granted by Heaven to any other people on the face of the earth,) of intrinsically greater value than specie, and for which the holders of specie would gladly part with the precious stuff.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/> It is desirable, and in a financial point of view of very great importance, to have a paper currency of uniform value and equivalent to specie, in every part of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/>This desideratum cannot be accomplished, I think, by any local banking institution.--Why not, in view of this importance, so shape the scheme as to accomplish this object through all time, for it may be assumed, without doing violence to probabilities, that when our ports are opened for trade, that the influx of specie into the exchequer, from duties on imports and from other sources, will be amply sufficient for the redemption of any bills for which the specie may be demanded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>In fact, I believe that the supply of specie will greatly preponderate in favor of the exchequer, when compared with any banking institution of the country. </p> </div3>
