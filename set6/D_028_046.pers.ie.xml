<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>To Arm and Equip an Additional force of cavalry, there is need of Carbines, Revolvers, Pistols, Saddles and other accoutrements of mounted men. Arms and equipments of the kind desired are believed to be held by citizens in sufficient numbers to supply our wants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Many keep them as trophies, and some with the expectation of using them in their own defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>But it should be remembered that arms are new required for use, and that they cannot be made so effectual for the defence of the country in any way as in the hands of organized troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>They are needed to enable our cavalry to cope with the well-armed and equipped cavalry of the enemy, not only in the <rs n="General Service" type="misc">general service</rs>, but in resisting those predatory expeditions which have inflicted so much loss upon the people of the interior. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>To the patriotic I need make no other appeal than the wants of the service, but I beg to remind those who are reluctant to part with the arms and equipments in their possession, that by keeping them they diminish the ability of the army to defend their property, without themselves deriving any benefit from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>I therefore urge all persons not in the service to deliver promptly, to some of the officers designated below, such arms and equipments especially these suitable for cavalry) as they may have, and to report to those officers the names of such persons as neglect to surrender those in their possession. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> Every citizen who prevents a carbine or pistol from remaining unused will render a service to his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Those who think to retain arms for their own defence should remember that if the army cannot protect them the arms will be of little use.--While no valid title can be acquired to public arms and equipments, except from the <rs>Government</rs>, it is reported that many persons have ignorantly purchased them from private parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>A fair compensation will, therefore, be made to all who deliver such arms and equipments to any ordnance officer, officer commanding at a post, officers and agents of the <rs>Quartermaster</rs> and Commissary Departments at any station, or officers in the enrolling service, or connected with the <rs type="place">Nitre and Mining Bureau</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>All these officers are requested, and those connected with this army are directed, to receive and receipt for all arms and equipments, whatever their condition, and forward the same, with a duplicate receipt, to the <orgName n="Ordnance Department" type="department">Ordnance Department</orgName> at <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, and report their proceedings to these headquarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>A reasonable allowance for their expenses and trouble will be made to such patriotic citizens as will collect and deliver to any of the officers above designated such arms and equipments as they may find in the hands of persons not in service, or who will report the same to those officers.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/> Where there have appeared diversities they have resulted from the difference in the efficiency of officers, the opposition of State authorities, the resistance of communities, and the exercise of the discretion vested in the <rs>Executive</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>In many cases, localities ordering on the lines of the enemy have required different proceedings from those applicable to the interior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>In some of these, great leniency was necessary; in some, such rigor as induced the <rs>Executive</rs> to charge military commanders with the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>In some sections the condition of the populations demanded leniency, others admitted the utmost rigor.

In <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> and <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, there was popular and constituted resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>The consequence was that while in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> there were but <num value="14000">fourteen thousand</num> conscripts, there are supposed to be <num value="16000">sixteen thousand</num> <hi rend="italics">quasi</hi>volunteers; while in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> there are <num value="21500">21,500</num> conscripts, and, perhaps, less than <num value="8000">8,000</num> <hi rend="italics">quasi</hi> volunteers.
