<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> Official dispatches received on the <num value="23" type="ordinal">23d</num> state that the enemy attacked <persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Early,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName> late yesterday (<num value="22" type="ordinal">22d</num>) at <placeName reg="Fishers Hill, Shenandoah, Virginia" key="tgn,2328677">Fisher's Hill</placeName>, and succeeded in forcing back the left of his line; and throwing a force in his rear, compelled him to abandon the position, leaving <num value="12">twelve</num> pieces of cannon in their hands, though losing but few men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> The above news, which was made public on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, furnished a theme for conversation throughout the day. It is useless to disguise the fact that it caused some feelings of despondency, because it took everybody by surprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The opinion was general that <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fisher</placeName>'s Hill, if not impregnable, was at least a very strong position, capable of a long and obstinate defence; and the hope had been fondly cherished that <persName n="Early,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Early,nomatch:0"><surname>Early</surname></persName> would have there been able to thwart the designs of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>But while some were despondent, the people were generally hopeful, and entertained no misgivings as to the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>It is true we have suffered a reverse, but nothing in comparison with what we have suffered before and survived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>All but the most inveterate croakers see the bright star of hope glimmering through the darkening clouds, and are confident that the tide of events will soon turn in our favor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> There were many rumors yesterday of the movements of our army in the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>, which it might be imprudent to mention until confirmed by official reports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>At last accounts, up to yesterday morning the enemy had reached <placeName reg="Harrisonburg, Harrisonburg, Virginia" key="tgn,2112170">Harrisonburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>This is the county seat of <placeName reg="Rockingham, Richmond, North Carolina" key="tgn,2076388">Rockingham</placeName>, and is situated <measure n="24miles" type="distance">twenty-four miles</measure> north northeast of <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> The report that the enemy, in heavy force, composed of infantry, artillery and cavalry &mdash; had made their appearance in <placeName reg="Culpeper, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002155">Culpeper county</placeName>--proves to be an error.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>We can only learn that a body of cavalry is hovering about there, probably for purposes of observation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> We have some few additional particulars of the fight near <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> last.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/> That we are approaching a very critical period of our existence as a people in certain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>Within <num value="1">one</num> month from the prevent time we shall once more be subjected to <num value="1">one</num> of those periodical trials to which we have now become accustomed, and which have been on often repeated that they have lost all their terrors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>The enemy is about to make another onslaught, with the <num value="2">two</num>-fold object of &#x0022;crushing the rebellion&#x0022; and re-electing <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00101" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>The letter is much the more important of the <num value="2">two</num>; the former is but secondary, and designed to aid in bringing about the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>The opening of the drum is not very encouraging, we admit; yet it is quite as much so as it was last spring, when <persName n="Jones,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00102" reg="mostcommon:Jones,nomatch:0"><surname>Jones</surname></persName> had been defeated, and <persName n="Hunter,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00103" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><surname>Hunter</surname></persName>, victorious and without opposition, was making his way triumphantly to <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>It is not on the flanks of our army that this matter is to be decided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>Whatever may happen there, is of <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>-rate importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>It is here, before <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and around <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, that the decision of the question is to be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>For ourselves, we entertain no doubt whatever of the manner in which it will terminate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>We place the utmost confidence in the genius of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00104" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> and the valor of his unrivalled army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>We believe that they will be again victorious, as they were last summer in a crisis far more perilous than this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>But they must have all the assistance that can be sent to them, and this we doubt not they will have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>Let our friends, then, possess their minds in peace, and place their firm reliance on that <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> which has so often shielded them from calamity when it appeared on the point of overwhelming them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>For what but the interposition of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> could have protected our cause thus far against an enemy so far excelling us in numbers and in all the appliances of war? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/> We are glad to see, at this critical moment, that the spirit of the people is high and defiant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>Let disaster come, they are prepared to bear it with fortitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>Let triumph come, they will receive it with moderation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>Unlike the degenerate race beyond the <rs>Potomac</rs> and the <rs>Ohio</rs>, they neither run made with exultation at every drifting success, nor sink into abject fear whenever defeated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>Success and defeat they bear with the same equanimity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>Let them be defeated to-morrow; let <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> be taken and <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> razed to the ground or consigned to the flames; still, they are as far from being subjugated as ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>They do not intend to submit, let their disasters be what they may. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/> But we have not the least fear that either of the catastrophes alluded to will take place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>As we have already said, we confide in <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00105" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> and his gallant army to bring us safely out, and we feel no apprehensions of the issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>If <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00106" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> failed last <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, with an army much larger than that which he has now, and every way its superior, we cannot see any reason why he should succeed now, when the bulk of his army is composed of the very offscouring of mankind; the scum of all the nations; the refuse of the human race, substituted for the tens upon tens of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of disciplined veterans that have fallen since he took command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>That the job he has undertaken is a most difficult <num value="1">one</num>, he himself makes evident by his call for <num value="100000">one hundred thousand</num> fresh troops, after having already expended double that number in the vain attempt to complete it. In all modern history there is no record of any enterprise against a single position having cost so much.--<num value="300000">Three hundred thousand</num> tried their hands last summer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>To these <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00107" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> now wishes to add <num value="100000">one hundred thousand</num> more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>With <num value="400000">four hundred thousand</num> men in a central position, an enterprising monarch, who was likewise a good soldier, could over whelm any monarchy in continental <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>Yet, with an army of that size, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have been thus far utterly unable to take this city, far less to conquer <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/> As for the reverses of <persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00108" reg="mostcommon:Early,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName> in the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>, that they are a serious inconvenience to us, we will not deny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>But we do deny that they are of such a character that they should discourage us or create a doubt as to ultimate success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>Even though that army were captured or destroyed, and we feel no apprehension upon either score, it would not decide the question, as long as <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00109" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> was in the field and had a gallant army under his command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>That army, at least, has no fear of the issue, so long as the life of their commander is preserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>There is no instance in modern times of greater devotion to a chief than that which the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">Army of Northern Virginia</orgName> feel and profess to <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00110" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>They believe that while he is with them they cannot be beaten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>They are proud of his high renown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>They know that the laurels which encircle his brow were placed there by their hands; and they will shed the last drop of blood rather than suffer the impure hands of a mercenary leader of banditti &mdash; such as <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00111" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, the tool of a tyrant as remorseless and as careless of human life as himself &mdash; to tear them from him. Now, this is the feeling which renders soldiers invincible &mdash; which made the troops of <persName n="Hannibal,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00112" reg="mostcommon:Hannibal,nomatch:0"><surname>Hannibal</surname></persName> believe that victory was chained to his standard and could not be divorced from it &mdash; which enabled C&#x00E6;sar to say, on a critical occasion, when his army murmured and refused to go forward in a certain expedition, &#x0022;If you will not go, I will take the <orgName type="regiment" key="10Legion">Tenth Legion</orgName> and go with them alone&#x0022;--which induced <persName n="Wellington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00113" reg="mostcommon:Wellington,nomatch:0"><surname>Wellington</surname></persName> to estimate <persName n="Bonaparte,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00114" reg="mostcommon:Bonaparte,nomatch:0"><surname>Bonaparte</surname></persName>'s presence on a field of battle as equal to <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> men. No index of a great commander is so little liable to mistake as this capacity of inspiring men with confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>As long as that army and that general exist, the enemy will not only never conquer the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, but will not even enter this city as a conqueror.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>Blood, it is true, must flow like water; but it is blood shed in the holiest of causes, every drop of which is sacred in the eyes of a whole people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/> It is the general belief that this will be the last great trial of the enemy &mdash; that if this fail he will become tired of throwing army after army into this yawning gulf of ruin and death &mdash; that if he be beaten now he will not repeat the experiment.--Whether it be so or not, we think there is very little doubt that the present onslaught is dictated by the near approach of the election, and is, in effect, an electioneering effort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>What the result of a defeat may be, we do not undertake to say; but that the attempt to take <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> will be again defeated, we no more doubt than we doubt our own existence. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
