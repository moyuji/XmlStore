<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>That the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> armies are no exception to this rule, is manifest from the hideous crimes and hard track of desolation which, even when professedly restrained by their commanders, have signalized their march through the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>What human imagination can compass the horrors which the removal of all restraint from such armies means? </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>He used often to come into the school-room to speak about the education of the children; and he never left me without my feeling that he had strengthened my hands and raised the standard I was aiming at.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>I dread the return of spring for my dear lady.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>it was his favorite time of the year &mdash; the opening leaves, the early flowers, and fresh green, were such a delight to him; and he so loved to point out their beauties to his children, that it will be terrible to see them without him. The children kept his table supplied with primroses, which he especially loved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The last <rs>Sunday</rs> he passed on earth was a very blessed <num value="1">one</num> for <persName><roleName n="Princess">the Princess</roleName> <foreName>Alice</foreName></persName> to look back upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>He was very ill and very weak, and she spent the afternoon alone with him, while the others were in church. </p>
