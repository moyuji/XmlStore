<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/>The few short, courteous and sympathizing words which <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> speech contains are sure to be misinterpreted on the other side of the <rs>Atlantic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>It is of no use to tell our <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> contemporaries that a position of neutrality is both the interest and the duty of this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/>It is a fact that the <rs>South</rs> has achieved Independence; and even if it were not so, the decisions of the ablest <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> jurists may be cited to show that foreign Governments are bound to recognize and respect successful revolt.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/> But, as the <rs>Northern</rs> people so willfully misinterpret the practical effect of <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> declaration of neutrality, it is worth while to inquire whether these international proceedings have the sanction of strict law.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/>This will give them universal currency throughout the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>; and as our ports are blockaded, and we must in consequence do without foreign importations, we can use this Government credit among ourselves so long as the war lasts; and when the war is over these notes will have to be funded into a permanent debt. </p>
