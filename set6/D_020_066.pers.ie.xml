<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> The hotels here continue to be well patronized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>There is considerable travel on the railroads terminating here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Occasionally some troops come in, too, from States a little further South. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> In some of the <rs>Southern</rs> seaport cities active measures have been taken, and arrangements are in progress, relative to the establishment of direct foreign trades as soon as the blockade shall be removed, which will be at no very distant day &mdash; probably in less than <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>. It is full time; therefore, that something should be commenced in this important matter in the principal seaport of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>A great deal has been said about a heavy trade between <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> and some of the great commercial ports of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and the <name>Continent</name>, and it is almost certain that a proper effort in this respect would be followed by a decided and very gratifying success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>But her own people must start the ball.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>This seems to be no time for the prosecution of commercial enterprises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The great business of the day is to prepare to meet and repel our enemies; but while we should not slacken our exertions to fill and increase our ranks upon the tented field, to man our batteries, rink the enemy's ships and sweep away the legions who seek our subjugation and rain, we should prepare to enter upon an enlarged and judicious system of foreign trade. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> Measures should be taken to establish agencies &mdash; companies should be formed, capital in vested and freely risked, ships built, wharf property bought or engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Preliminary arrangements at least should be made to secure heavy shipments hence to foreign ports and to receive such goods in return as would attract dealer here from the various parts of the <rs>Southern</rs> country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>This will be a valuable means of defence against a vassalage which the <rs>South</rs> has suffered long and patiently, while her capital has contributed vastly in the work of building merchant palaces and princely halls in these cities, whence comes now the clamorous cry,<q>&#x0022;Crush out the <rs>Southern</rs> rebels &mdash; burn the tories, hang the traitors; go and revel amid the booty and the beauty.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> Our works of infernal improvement give us a connection with the vast and productive regions of the <name>South</name>, <name>South</name><name>west</name> and <name>West</name>, including the exhaustless <placeName reg="Mississippi Valley">Valley of the Mississippi</placeName>, while we are at the very outlet of large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>rivers whose source is in the mountains and which pass in graceful meandering through rich portions of the Old Dominion and the <orgName n="Old North State" type="newspaper">Old North State</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Here we have the road stead, the harbor, the depth of water, and the warehouses &mdash; and almost within hearing of the ceaseless voice of the ocean itself, Experience has proved, however, that vastly superior natural advantages will not bring wealth, influence and commercial greatness, Men must act; capital must be invested; must be withdrawn from other sources and put in ocean steamers and clipper ships and foreign trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>it is time to think about this matter, and to act, if it is really desired to have here at this Heaven-favored location, a great <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> seaport city, showing that our people appreciate the vast advantages bestowed by Nature, and are animated by that commendable spirit of enterprise and rivalry that have worked results in other sections that have astonished the world. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> There was a time when there were extensive ship yards at this port &mdash; all as busy as they could be &mdash; and no haggling about prices; the only question was; How soon can the work be done?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Hundreds of vessels were discharging and receiving cargoes, and the streets and wharves were thronged with busy people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>As early as <dateStruct value="1769--"><year reg="1769">1769</year></dateStruct> the importations of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, principally of this port, amounted to &#x00A3; <num value="551000">551,000</num>; and they increased till the war and the burning of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Then rapidly recovering from the disasters of the <name>Revolution</name>, as early as <dateStruct value="1805--"><year reg="1805">1805</year></dateStruct>, the trade in the last <num value="2">two</num> quarters of that year, with <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, the <name>West Indire</name>, &#x0026;c., on lumber, naval stores, tobacco, provisions, &#x0026;c., amounted to <measure n="1852883dollars" type="currency">$1,852,883</measure>. This year transactions in domestic produce amount to <measure n="3088347dollars" type="currency">$3,088,347</measure>, and foreign articles <measure n="507907dollars" type="currency">$507,907</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> The number of vessels from foreign ports entered here in <dateStruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>was <num value="355">355</num>; <dateStruct value="1801--"><year reg="1801">1801</year></dateStruct>, <num value="369">369</num>; <dateStruct value="1802--"><year reg="1802">1802</year></dateStruct>, <num value="453">453</num>; <dateStruct value="1804--"><year reg="1804">1804</year></dateStruct>, <num value="484">484</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The people then possessed, in an eminent degree, the chivalry of the commercial character, and displayed in their bearing a dignity and a grace which looked infinitely beyond an ignoble rivalry and the tricks of the trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>But the heavy trade was diverted to Northern ports. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> With a just appreciation and judicious improvement of our natural advantages and favorable position, who can foretell the future greatness of this port, now that the idea that New York must do the shipping and the importing has been abolished, and it is found that those whom the <rs>South</rs> has enriched and elevated to untold wealth and influence, are now her worst enemies, and ungratefully and wickedly sick to subjugate and enslave us.--Surely, it is not too soon to unite with other Southern cities in the great and important work of preparing for an era of Southern commercial supremacy. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> Brethren: In a pastoral letter lately issued to the <name>Clergy</name> and Laity of <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>, I took occasion to intimate a doubt existing in my mind as to the nature of my Episcopal jurisdiction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>I hoped at that time to have an opportunity to confer with you and to obtain your sanction for the course determined upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Farther consideration has persuaded me that it is best to wait no lunger; much as I would value your counsel and advice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> Under the <rs>Constitution</rs> and Canons by which we have been governed the <rs type="place">Church</rs> claimed jurisdiction over <q>&#x0022;all persons belonging to it within the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.&#x0022;</q> Within the organized dioceses, jurisdiction when given by the diocese and confirmed by the <orgName n="General Convention" type="misc">General Convention</orgName>, was absolute and permanent except for cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Not thus is it however outside them limits. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> Into States and Territories not organized into dioceses, the <rs type="place">Church</rs> sent Missionary, Bishops <q>&#x0022;to exercise Episcopal functions.&#x0022;</q> She imposed upon them peculiar restrictions, for they are bound to discharge their functions <q>&#x0022;under such regulations and instructions as the <rs type="place">House of Bishops</rs> may prescribe, and the <rs>Home</rs> of Bishops may at any time increase or diminish the number of States of Territories over which the said Bishops shall exercise Episcopal functions.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> The Diocesan Bishops possess a character, and are invested with a jurisdiction which remains unaltered by any re-arrangement of provincial boundaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The Missionary <rs type="role2">Bishop</rs> is emphatically a missionary or delegate sent forth by the general body, subordinate to the <rs type="place">Episcopal College</rs>, and in effect dependent for jurisdiction upon its will. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>The calculation is that these attacks upon the <rs>South</rs> will cause a withdrawal of troops from <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> for Southern defence, and thus make the.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/> --It is impossible to mobilize an army of any magnitude in a mountain country, if it is to adhere rigidly to the rules of military <unclear>ptry,</unclear> and never to hazard its communication with supplies, or to march without a long retinue of baggage-wagons and camp equipage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>Celerity and suddenness of movement are the great essentials of success in mountain warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>An army which can carry its provisions on its back for <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> and can march and bivouac all the time without baggage or encumbrances of any sort, cannot fail to make itself-felt in mountain campaigning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>The lamest of all excuses for a General commanding in such a region is that of had roads and steep assents.-- Soldiers on foot can get over ground without the facility of wagon roads, and can zigzag up and down mountains of any declivity so that they be not perpendicular. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/> Celerity of movement makes an army mach stronger than an enemy of equal force, If <num value="5000">five thousand</num> hostile forces are in <num value="1">one</num> place, and <num value="5000">five thousand</num> in another, a good General, with an active army of <num value="6000">six thousand</num> men, can whip the <num value="10">ten</num>, by pouncing upon the most accessible body of the enemy <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and attending to the other <num value="5000">five thousand</num> afterwards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>Vigor and rapidity of motion compensates for the want of numbers, and multiply an army's strength. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/> The <rs>Texans</rs> furnished admirable examples of small numbers resisting great ones in their revolution; and they were enabled to do so simply by carrying with them in their marches dried meat and provisions in sufficient quantity to last them many days at a time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>Parched corn is now recommended by some of them as an admirable substitute for bread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>Jerked beef and parched corn are light articles, and enough of them can be carried in a haversack for a week or a fortnight's supply. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/> This mode of campaigning, if it could be successfully employed by our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, would greatly facilitate the re-conquest of North-<placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">western Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>The populous States of <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName> and <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, not to speak of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, are too near to that portion of our State to permit us to cope with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> there with equal numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>It is necessary for us to make up by celerity of movement for our deficiency of numerical strength We must, of course, have magazines for provisions and ammunition, regular camps, and baggage wagons and tent equipage in sufficient quantity; but the movements of our troops will have to be disengaged from these encumbrances, if we would accomplish the early expulsion of the enemy, much less the carrying of the war into <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/> The old <placeName key="tgn,7007826" n="1.000 4" reg="texas">Texas</placeName> system of <q>&#x0022;ranging&#x0022;</q> for a fortnight at a time, with no other food-than jerked beef, or dried venison, or buffalo haunch and parched corn, furnishes an admirable suggestion to our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> as to the mode of obviating the chief difficulty in the way of mobilizing their forces and quickening our operations in the mountain regions of our State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>Our supplies of horses for any purpose are so great, that we can mobilize any desirable number of artillery and cavalry companies to support the <orgName n="Light Infantry" type="infantry">light infantry</orgName> and rifle troops thus prepared for rapid operations With the large supply of light cannon in the hands of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>, with the unlimited supplies of horses at their command with any number of thorough horse-man in the service, there is but <num value="1">one</num> single thing needful for the completion of the most admirable force for mountain warfare that the world ever saw: and that is the procurement of such articles of food as can be carried by the men in quantities to last <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> or a fortnight at a time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>We may drive the enemy out of our mountains by regular military operations, but <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName> can never be deemed secure from invasion by <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> raids, until some system of warfare is adopted on our side which will admit of that suddenness and rapidity of military movement which is necessary to give smaller numbers an advantage over great ones. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>He also said in reply to questions propounded by myself, that he had no intention of sending forces to Peducan or <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName> to blockade these ports, but would leave it with the civil authorities, and that the collectors could carry out the instructions of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> or not as they had the power at said places, and that he would return all fugitive slaves that night escape from <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and come to either of his encampments.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/> I learned, when in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, from some of the friends of the <rs>President</rs>, that he was exceedingly tender-footed on the meaning of certain terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>He was not willing to &#x0022;respect in the neutral position of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, for that would be to acknowledge her right to assumes it; but he was entirely willing to <q>&#x0022;observe&#x0022;</q> it. To me the discovery was of interest, for it had not previously occurred to me that I would find such a nice discrimination of terms in an official who had not apparently discovered the lines which divide a constitutional republic from an absolute military despotism, and who classes a party platform above the <rs>Constitution</rs> which he is sworn to support. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/> I had a very friendly interview with the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>I justified the attitude of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> on the ground that the <rs>President</rs> had himself confessedly violated the <rs>Constitution</rs> and, therefore, had no right to call upon <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> to aid him in this violation; and that even if his acts were justified, as he claimed, by necessity, the same cause, when it was a question of internal peace in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> would justify the attitude she had assumed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/> <placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> succeeded in impressing upon me the belief that as long as there were roads around <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> to reach the rebellion, it was his purpose to leave her unmolested, not yielding her right to the position she occupied, but <hi rend="italics">observing</hi> it as a matter of policy, So fully was I impressed with this purpose on his part that I suggested that if he would make to me a definite statement of his policy, I would take pleasure in announcing it to the public, assuring him that, in my opinion, it would tend greatly to allay public excitement and to preserve the peace of the <rs>State</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/> On my return by appointment, <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> afterwards, the <rs>President</rs> wrote in the presence of Hop. <persName n="Crittenden,,J.,F.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00147" reg="default:Crittenden,J.,F.,,"><foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>F.</foreName> <surname>Crittenden</surname></persName> and myself, and handed me the following paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>He accounted for the absence of his signature by saying that he did not intend to write a proclamation,&#x0022; but to give me a paper on which I could base my statements of his policy, and which would be my evidence hereafter, if any difference should arise relative to that policy; and he appealed to <persName n="Crittenden,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00149" reg="nearbymention:Crittenden,J.,F.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Crittenden</surname></persName>, who was present, to identify the paper in any way that he thought proper.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/> Though the paper is not generally characterized with directions, there is in it a positive statement that no purpose existed in his mind to send troops to <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>On this assertion, which I was bound to believe was candid, I have until recently, not hesitated to state that I believed the <rs>President</rs> would continue to <q>&#x0022;observe&#x0022;</q> the neutrality of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, unless compelled to take a different course, by a few Union men who would be entirely willing to make every hearth-stone desolate, if it would subserve their ambitions purposes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/> But there is every reason to believe that at the very time the <rs>President</rs> gave me, the paper, he meditated deception; for on either the same day or the previous day, an officer entirely in his confidence on the subject, left his presence, and has ever since been engaged in organizing troops in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, under the authority of the <rs>President</rs>, and with his subsequent approval. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/> This, of course, is a clear violation of neutrality as if troops had been ordered from another State, and I could not conceive that the <rs>President</rs>, would be guilty of such disingenuousness as to endeavor to make any distinction, between ordering troops from another State and organizing, without the desire of the <rs>Governor</rs> or the <name>Legislature</name>, a revolutionary force in the <rs>State</rs>, thus interposing between the <rs>Government</rs> of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and its people.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/> The development of these facts renders it necessary that I should now make public the paper which was given me to justify the statement I have made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>That paper and the other assurances of the <rs>President</rs>, induced me to believe he was sincere and determined me while I would not give my active support to a Government that was acting so absurdly and so wickedly wrong in other respects at least to refrain from opposing it as long as their was enough of justice left in its administration to respect the attitude assumed by my own State. </p> 
<p>
