<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>Thursday was very cold, the mercury being only <num value="10">10</num> deg, above zero; and during the night it sleeted and snowed, as it did also the following night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>It was early <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> before they ventured out again, when they brought them in. They were still alive, but blue with cold and covered with frost and snow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>They did what they could for them, but it was not much, and for this reason. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/> For a week they had been guarding their earthworks, <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> in length, and from Thursday they had been out in force, night and day; many of them in the rifle pits froze their feet and hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>On the boat I saw young officers whose slaves pulled off their stockings, and as they did so the skin from various parts of the feet came along with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>In passing from their works to their quarters they frequently had to <unclear></unclear> deep, and then lay down to sleep in their wet clothes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>It would have been merciful if, at the close of each day, we had been permitted under a truce to bring off our wounded; but it was not so, and they lay in the frost and sleet between the <num value="2">two</num> armies &mdash; many to hear, but none to help them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/> The severity of the cold is well illustrated by the statement made by our field officers, who rode from post to post during the night, that in the morning their clothes were so stiff that could they have been taken off they would have stood alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>From their representative man, the Rail-splitter, down to the lowest of the jail birds whom they have let loose upon our soil, they have exhibited none of the qualities which constitute a gentleman &mdash; courtesy, magnanimity, truth, honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>All the fine dressing in the world can no more disguise a blackguard so that he shall pass for a gentleman, than the trappings of a war horse can hide the long cars of a mule or convert his dissonant bray into the &#x0022;Ha!
