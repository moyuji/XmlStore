<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> Although the exertions of the <rs>North</rs> in carrying on war against us, the magnitude of its preparations and the number of its forces have far exceeded any apprehensions we entertained when hostilities commenced, yet its success has fallen still further short of those apprehensions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>We feared, yet expected, and were prepared to bear up against, an invasion into the very heart of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>We knew that each step of advance, on their part, would weaken their force and increase our means of defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Had the <q>&#x0022;Grand Army&#x0022;</q> fought at <placeName reg="Culpeper Court-House">Culpeper Court-House</placeName> instead of <placeName key="tgn,2015942" n="1.000 10" reg="Manassa, Conejos, Colorado">Manassa</placeName>, the <q>&#x0022;Grand Army&#x0022;</q> would now have been a thing of the past.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> But, instead of invading us, our enemy has been exhausting his resources, both in men and money, in defending <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>They now boast that it is impregnable as <placeName reg="Gibraltar, Union, North Carolina" key="tgn,2348613">Gibraltar</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>We do not believe that, but on the contrary think that with immense loss of life on our part, we might take it; yet it is certainly their strongest point, defended as it is by the broad Potomac, by their fleet, which commands its navigation, by immense artificial fortifications, and by an army of a <num value="150000">hundred and fifty thousand</num> men. It is their strongest point, and they invite and advise us to attack it. Shall we turn foolhardy and swear like the school-boys that <q>&#x0022;we won't take a dare,&#x0022;</q> or shall we assail them where they are weakest, not where they are strongest? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> Suppose they winter in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, is not that failure on their part; success on ours?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>When they look coolly at their position next spring, and see that after a year of active hostilities, after many disastrous defeats and no victories, after the loss in camp, or on the battle-field of a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> lives, and after the expenditure of <num value="500000000">five hundred millions</num> of dollars, they have not even begun to invade the <rs>South</rs>; but, on the contrary, have lost <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, which belonged to them when the war begun &mdash; and almost lost <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>--is it probable that they will be disposed to carry on any longer so hopeless a war? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> But if we could take <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, would it be advisable to do so?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>Nobody seemed to be guarding them, and for some minutes we stood watching the caged crowd within, screeching, whistling, fluttering, singing, in curious contrast, and yet not without a certain likeness to the perambulating crowd without.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>Though the thing took place years ago, yet could anybody who was present at that confirmation luncheon at Waterwold vicarage, forget what happened then?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>By dint of hearing so much about the luncheon, I naturally came to take a deep interest in its success, so that when on the great day we were ushered into the vicarage dining-room, I was as <persName n="Pepys,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00055" reg="mostcommon:Pepys,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Pepys</surname></persName> says, <q>&#x0022;mighty pleased that the table did look so handsome,&#x0022;</q> and shared my wife's satisfaction on observing that the great jelly-lion &mdash; for a long time a refractory beast, bent upon coming out of its mould minus its head &mdash; had been melted down into submission, and shook the terrors of its mane, every hair complete, in full view of the bishop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>He was a grave but genial man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>Haven't you anything to say to me, Coco?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/> At the sound of <q>&#x0022;Coco,&#x0022;</q> his own name, which he had not heard at the vicarage, the bird set up all his feathers; perhaps he was excited, too, by the sight of so much company and good cheer; perhaps he fell bound to answer when addressed by a bishop.--Opening his beak with a scream which made everybody jump, he burst into the heartiest commination service a bishop ever had the luck to listen to. You may imagine, though I can't describe the commotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>The ladies held their ears, the best thing they could do; the servants could not reach the cage to get it down; and how that bird went on while the steps were being brought, and our host, very red and nervous, unhooked and hustled him out of the room at last!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>The vicar came back in a minute or <num value="2">two</num>, with his finger and thumb bitten, I believe in an attempt to wring the creature's neck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>Nothing short of such a measure could have stopped the bird, and this had not succeeded, for all the rest of the luncheon, though everybody tried hard to seem as if they didn't hear it, there was a perpetual grinding growl, the exact voice of the <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> sailor, Coco's previous owner, issuing from the dark closet under the stairs, to which he had been consigned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>Of course, we all felt what very naughty words the bird was saying, and the conversation flagged forthwith; somehow, it wasn't easy to keep up church-talk, and school-talk, and religious societies&#x0027; talk with the accompaniment of a swearing parrot in the background.--After such an experience, you may suppose I should avoid the purchase of a bird which might, like Coco, talk <q>&#x0022;not wisely, but too well.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/> For those who have any curiosity in observing the steps by which an animal grows perfect in its little round of experiences and actions, a young parrot is a most interesting study.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>A bird of <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> is a quiet little thing, <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of its full size, sitting stupidly on its perch all day long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>Besides getting its full feathers, and growing a fine red tail, it has to accomplish a great deal in the way of education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>Of course, in the case of a solitary individual, where instinct is not helped on by the imitative faculty, the process is much more slow and difficult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>Its natural note &mdash; not a pleasant <num value="1">one</num>, half plaint and half chirp &mdash; has to be changed through the range of inarticulate sounds from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> faint gabble up to perfect human speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>That its beak is an anchor, a fever, and a means of transport, as well as of mastication, the creature has yet to find out; and it must lean this before it can perform its monkey feats of climbing,* swinging, and suspending itself head downwards, precisely like a bird hanging in a larder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>And, finally, it has to arrive at the knowledge which seems to come last of all &mdash; that his claw is a prehensile organ. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/> Have parrots any notion of the sense of words?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>A question which has been often mooted, and most writers, with Pone at their head, give a verdict against the bird's intelligence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/><milestone unit="column" n="5"/> </p> 
<p> they say; attaching, like cats and dogs, certain meanings to certain sounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>My parrot, for instance, knows his own name &mdash; Coco; and that the worth <q>&#x0022;Pussy,&#x0022;</q> <q>&#x0022;Scamp,&#x0022;</q> represent the cat and dog, the meaning of some words of praise and blame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>He gives their respective names also to inmates of the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>He goes a step beyond even, for when a pet-robin walks in at the window for his daily dole, Coco calls out patronizingly; <q>&#x0022;Pretty bird &mdash; pretty little bird?&#x0022;</q> and addresses the house-canary in the same way. Here he shews a power of generalization; he has an idea that a creature with beak and feathers is a bird like himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/><q>&#x0022;Kiss Coco,&#x0022;</q> and <q>&#x0022;Coco pecks,&#x0022;</q> are also phrases understood, for he suits the action to the word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>When he calls for food, he calls intelligently; and it shown apples, nuts, &#x0026;c., of which he is fond &mdash; the name at the same time being repeated &mdash; he soon picks up the word, and attaches it to the object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>It is plain, therefore, that the bird is more or less intelligent in respect of words which represent an object or action perfectly familiar to him; beyond this, his speech becomes mere imitation of sound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>A very sagacious parrot of my acquaintance offers a good example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>All birds in captivity should be fed as nearly as possible as they feed themselves in freedom.--Now, the <name>Psittacine</name>&#x00E6; are strict vegetarians; young shoots, pulpy fruits, grain, and almonds, make up their bill of fare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>To keep your bird in full health and beauty --which is the visible sign of health &mdash; you must confine him to bread soaked in water (no milk, remember,) hemp-seed, or hemp and canary mixed; a bit of hard biscuit, or crust dried in the oven, is healthful; dates, nuts; in fact, any dry or ripe fresh fruit in moderation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>He has Paddy's taste for a good boiled potato, which may be indulged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/> &#x0022;To supply the want of <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs>, which seemed to have suddenly evaporated, the <orgName n="Constituent Assembly" type="assembly">Constituent Assembly</orgName> created a paper currency, under the name of <hi rend="italics">Assignats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/></hi> That confidential money, if the people had thought proper to understand and adopt it, would have answered every purpose of a metallic currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>It would have multiplied transactions between private individuals, paid the wages of labor, discharged taxes, and represented the price of land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>A circulating medium, let economists say what they will, has no other value than that of the covenant which creates it and the credit which it carries along with it. It is sufficient that the proportion between the thing bought and the representation of value which buys it, should not be suddenly and arbitrarily changed by a disorderly expansion of that representation; the actual and true price of everything settles down in conformity with that proportion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>A law, and an honest and wise law, only, then, can create a circulating medium.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>Let a medium thus established be of <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs> or of paper, it is a matter of little importance, provided only the proportion be religiously observed, and that the people also retain their confidence in the faith and credit of the currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>A bill of exchange, a species of individual currency, which has no other value than the signature of the drawer, supplies, in private transactions, the place of any given sum. It has all the effect of <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>It is nothing more than a currency created by a private individual, the representative of the confidence reposed in him.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/> The assignats failed to constitute a good currency for a variety of reasons, apart from the established habits of the <rs>French</rs> people, who had been accustomed to no other medium than <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs>, and had come, from habit, to regard those metals not as the representatives of value, but as possessing a certain, absolute, intrinsic value of their own, altogether disconnected with the thing they were intended to represent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>They had, moreover, no confidence in the <rs>Government</rs>, or rather in the succession of Governments by which they were issued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>They knew them all to be composed of public plunderers, who would be faithful to no engagement any longer than it suited their interest or convenience to be so. Had they been ever so honest, and ever so well disposed to comply with their obligations, they saw not how it could possibly be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>There was nothing upon which to base a credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>Usurers got hold of it, and employed it in purchasing whatever was for sale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>The agents of the <rs>Government</rs> bought it up, and used it in the same manner; for there was a law punishing with death any who objected to taking it at <hi rend="italics">par.</hi> But, above all, there was no restriction upon the issue.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/> Now, it is very certain that our Government will be compelled to create a paper circulation of some sort, if we are expected to carry on this war &mdash; and we hope there is no idea of abandoning it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/> <hi rend="italics">Precautions against Thirst in Marching.</hi>--Enjoin on yourself, and others, to drink well before starting in the morning; to keep the mouth shut; to chew a bit of sassafras or slippery elm bark, a leaf, a straw, &#x0026;c., Arab like to keep the mouth covered with a cloth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>Tying a handkerchief wetted with salt water around the neck allays thirst for a considerable time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>Men may live long without drinking, if they have the means of keeping their skin wet with water, otherwise undrinkable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/> <hi rend="italics">To Purify Water that is Muddy, Putrid, or Salt.</hi> With muddy water the remedy is to filter, and to use alum if you have it. With putrid, to boil, to mix with charcoal, or to expose to the sun and air; or, what is best, to use all <num value="3">three</num> methods at the same time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>With salt water, nothing avails but disullation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/> <hi rend="italics">To Filter Muddy Water.</hi>--When at the watering place there is nothing but wet sand, take a good handful of grass and tie it roughly together, in the form of a cone, <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="8inches" type="distance">eight inches</measure> long; then, dipping the broad end into the puddle and turning it up, a streamlet of partly filtered water will trickle down through the small end. Otherwise, strain through your cap or handkerchief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>For a copious supply the most perfect plan, if you have means, is to bore a flask full of auger holes, and put another small <num value="1">one</num> that has had the bottom knocked out inside of it; then fill up the space between the <num value="2">two</num> with grass, moss, &#x0026;c.; now sinking the whole in the midst of the pond, the water will filter through the auger-holes and moss, and rise up clear of at least weeds and sand, in the inner cask, whence it can be ladled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>With a single cask, the lower parts of the sides may be bored, and alternate layers of sand and grass thrown in till they reach far above the holes.--Through these layers the water will strain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>Or any coarse bag that is kept open with hoops made on the spot, may be moored in the muddy pool by having a heavy stone put inside of it, and will act on the same principle, but less efficiently, as the casks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>Sand, charcoal, sponge, and wool, are the substances most commonly used in filters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>Peat charcoal is excellent, so is magnetic iron ore. Turbid water is also, in some way as yet insufficiently explained, made clear by putting a piece of alum into it; it appears to unite with the mud, and to form a clayey deposit; and, independently of this, to have effect upon organic matters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>No taste of alum remains in the water, unless it has been used in great excess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/><num value="3">Three</num> thimblefuls of alum will clarify a bucketful of turbid water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>It is generally used in <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/> Putrid water should always be boiled with charcoal or charred sticks before drinking it, as low fevers and dysenteries too often are the consequences of its being used indiscreetly, but the charcoal entirely disinfects it; bitter herbs &mdash; rue, hoarhound, boneset &mdash; if steeped in it, or even rubbed well about the cup, are said to render it less unwholesome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>The <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indians</rs> plunge hot iron into putrid and muddy water. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/> <hi rend="italics">Distilling.</hi>--<num value="10">Ten</num> gallons of pure water can be distilled in <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty- four hours</measure> by the aid of a gun-barrel and an iron pot. The crew of the <rs>Levant</rs> packet, wrecked near the <rs type="place">Cosmoledo islands</rs>, thus supplied themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>They fitted a wooden lid to their pot, leaving a hole of sufficient size to receive the muzzle of the gun-barrel, which was to act as a steam pipe; the barrel was run through the stump of a tree hollowed out in the middle and kept full of water for the purpose of condensation, and the water so distilled escaped at the nipple of the gun-barrel, and was conducted into a bottle placed to receive it. There is nothing in the arrangement that will hurt the most highly-finished gun-barrel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>The condensing trough may be made of canvas, or even dispensed with altogether.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>In default of other tubes, a reed or <num value="1">one</num> of the long bones either of an animal or of a wading bird will be found better than nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>To construct a good furnace for the boiler, build a stone parallelogram, open at the end from which the wind blows, and with the stones of the opposite end higher than the sides by the height of the pot with its lid on. The pot will be supported by the stones on each side, and the condensing trough between the higher stone at the end of the fire-place, and another stone or bank of the same height at the cool end of the tube, below which is placed the receiving vessel. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
