<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> The <num value="2">two</num> armies confront each other still, though in other respects some interesting changes have occurred since the date of my last letter from this place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/><persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> has rebuilt the lower (trestle) bridge that was carried away by the freshet some <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> ago. This time he has made it higher, and apparently stronger, than it was before, but not so high or so strong, it is hoped, that it may not be swept away by the heavy rain which has been falling here for the last <measure n="36hours" type="date">thirty-six hours</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> It is believed, also, that <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> has sent his horses to the rear &mdash; probably to points on the railroad where they will be convenient to forage &mdash; as none have been seen about <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> for the last few days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>This step, if it has been taken, will diminish greatly the pressure upon his wagon trains, the principal labors of which will hereafter be limited to the transportation of supplies for the <rs>Federal</rs> troops. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> The shortest and best road by which he can haul these supplies passes along the north bank of the <placeName key="tgn,2715022" n="1.000 335" reg="tennessee river, united states, north and central america">Tennessee</placeName> at a sharp bend in the river, <num value="6">six</num> or <placeName><distance reg="8miles">eight miles</distance> below <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>At this point the trains are exposed to the fire of our sharpshooters, posted on the south bank, who attacked <num value="1">one</num> of the trains on the <dateStruct value="--11"><day reg="2">11th</day></dateStruct>, killed a number of mules, and completely blocked up the way. The following day the enemy shelled the woods along the river in that vicinity, with the hope of driving the <rs>Confederates</rs> away or of making them show themselves; but he succeeded in doing neither.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Should we be able to close this road, the distance by the circuitous route which the trains would be compelled to travel would be almost, if not quite, doubled, whilst the difficult and rugged character of the way would be increased in the same ratio. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> It is not probable, however, that the enemy will abandon the lower or river road without making a strong effort to keep it open.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The difficulty of procuring supplies is already serious enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>It is reported that a provision train arrived night before last, and that for some days previous the <rs>Federal</rs> army had been put upon shorter rations than any <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName> in the field has ever been reduced to. This lower road passes through the town of <placeName reg="Jasper, Marion, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099750">Jasper</placeName>, to which point, it is further reported, the <rs>Federals</rs> are building, if they have not already completed, a railroad, connecting with the <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName> and <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> road at <placeName reg="Bridgeport, Cocke, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098103">Bridgeport</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The roadbed for this work was prepared, as I learn, before the commencement of the war. --When put into operation, it will reduce the distance from <placeName reg="Bridgeport, Cocke, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098103">Bridgeport</placeName> to <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, by the wagon road, nearly <num value="1">one</num> <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> We are without further intelligence from <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName>, and nothing has been heard of <persName n="Wheeler,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Wheeler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Wheeler</surname></persName>, for whose safety considerable uneasiness is felt in official circles.* The <orgName n="Louisville Journal" type="newspaper">Louisville <hi rend="italics">Journal</hi></orgName>, of the <dateStruct value="--3"><day reg="3">3d inst.</day></dateStruct>, says that <persName n="Slocum,Major-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Slocum,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major-General">Major General</roleName> <surname>Slocum</surname></persName> and <persName n="Williams,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="nearbymention:Williams,Thos,,,"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier Generals</roleName> <surname>Williams</surname></persName> and <persName n="Knipe,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Knipe,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Brigadier-General"></roleName><surname>Knipe</surname></persName>, of the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>, arrived at that city on the evening of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>It is believed that these officers and their commands have already reached their destination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/><persName n="Slocum,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Slocum,nomatch:0"><surname>Slocum</surname></persName> and <persName n="Williams,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="nearbymention:Williams,Thos,,,"><surname>Williams</surname></persName> each commanded a <hi rend="italics">corps d'armes</hi> at the <rs n="Battle of Chancellorsville" type="battle">battle of Chancellorsville</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>It may be that a portion of the reinforcements sent to <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> has been ordered to <placeName reg="Bridgeport, Cocke, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098103">Bridgeport</placeName>, <persName n="Stevenson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Stevenson,nomatch:0"><surname>Stevenson</surname></persName>, and other points along the enemy's line of communications, and that <persName n="Wheeler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Wheeler,nomatch:0"><surname>Wheeler</surname></persName> has encountered a heavier force than he expected when he started on his expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>We have no information in regard to the whereabouts of the <rs>Federal</rs> cavalry. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> This was the state of affairs when that which we certainly had no part in broke out &mdash; when, if I remember rightly, <num value="9">nine</num> of the <rs>Southern States</rs> of <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName> declared that they would form an independent republic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Our course on the subject has been at tacked and blamed in the bitterest terms &mdash; blamed sometimes by the <rs>Federals</rs> and some times by the <rs>Confederates</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> offence was felt by the <rs>Federals</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>They said we had no right to grant &mdash; so far as we were concerned &mdash; to the <rs>Confederates</rs> the rights of belligerents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Well, now, gentlemen, that question of the rights of belligerents is a question of fact; I put it to you whether, with <num value="5000000">five millions</num> of people, <num value="5000000">5,000,000</num> I mean of free men, declaring themselves in their several States collectively an independent State, we could pass over that as a petty rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Our <rs type="role2">Admirals</rs> asked whether the ships they met bearing the <rs>Confederate</rs> flag should be treated as pirates or no. If we had treated them as pirates, we should have been taking part in that contest.--[Cheers.] It was impossible to look on the uprising of a community of <num value="5000000">5,000,000</num> people as a mere petty insurrection--[hear, hear]--or as not having the rights which at all times are given to those who, by their numbers and importance, or by the extent of the territory they possess, are entitled to these rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>[Cheers.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> Well, it was said we ought not to have done that because they were a community of slaveholders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Gentlemen, I trust that our abhorrence of slavery is not in the least abated or diminished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>[Loud and prolonged cheers.] For my own part I consider it <num value="1">one</num> of the most horrible crimes that yet disgraces humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>[Cheers.] But then, when we are treating of the relations which we bear to a community of men, I doubt whether it would be expedient or useful for humanity that we should introduce that new element of declaring that we will have no relations with a people who permit slavery to exist among them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>We have never adopted it yet; we have not adopted it in the case of <placeName reg="Espana" key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName> or <placeName reg="Brasil" key="tgn,1000047">Brazil</placeName>, and I do not believe that the cause of humanity would be served by our adopting it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/> Well it was said that these <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> were rebels &mdash; rebels against the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Perhaps, gentlemen, I am not so nice as I ought to be on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>[Hear, and laughter.] I am not saying now whether all these rebellions were justifiable, or whether they were wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>I am not saying whether the present rebellion in the <rs>Southern States</rs> is justifiable insurrection, or is a great fault or a great crime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>But I say that the mere fact of rebellion is not in my eyes a crime of so deep a dye that we must renounce all fellowship and communion and all relationship with those who have been guilty of rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>[Loud cheering.] But, certainly, if I look to the declarations of those <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> orators &mdash; and I have been reading lately, if not the whole, yet a very great part, of the very long speech by <persName n="Sumner,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName> on the subject, delivered at New York &mdash; I own I cannot but wonder to see these men, the offspring as it were of <num value="3">three</num> rebellions, as we are the offspring of <num value="2">two</num> rebellions, really speaking, like the <name>Czar</name> of <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>, the <name>Sultan</name> of <placeName key="tgn,1000144" n="1.000 41" reg="turkiye">Turkey</placeName>, or <persName><foreName>Louis</foreName> <genName n="14">XIV</genName></persName>, himself, of the dreadful crime and guilt of rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/> Our people were suffering, and suffering very greatly, for the want of the material which was the great support of their industry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>It was a question of self-interest whether we should not break that blockade; but, in my opinion, the name of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> would be forever infamous if, for the sake of interest of any kind, we had violated the general laws of nations and made war with these slaveholding States of <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName> against the <rs>Federal States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>[Hear, hear.] And, gentlemen, I am not speaking the sentiments peculiar to myself, or to those who have no immediate interest in the question; but these are, I am convinced, the sentiments of that noble-hearted people of <placeName key="tgn,7008154" n="1.000 10" reg="lancashire,england,united kingdom,europe">Lancashire</placeName> who have lived and flourished by that industry, but who would not, I am sure, allow a single spot on the escutcheon of their nation in order to maintain that industry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/> The principle is clear enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>If you are asked to sell muskets, you may sell muskets to <num value="1">one</num> party or to the other; and so with regard to gunpowder, shells, or cannon, and you may sell a ship in the same manner.--But if you, on the other hand, train and drill a regiment with arms in their hands, or allow a regiment to go out with arms in their hands to take part with <num value="1">one</num> of <num value="2">two</num> belligerents, you violate your neutrality and commit an offence against the other belligerents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>So in the same way in regard to ships; if you allow a ship to be armed and go at once to make an attack on a foreign belligerent you are yourself, according to your own law, taking part in the war, and it is an offence which is punished by the law. But these questions lead, as you will see, to the most difficult problems &mdash; as to whether, for instance, a <num value="1000">thousand</num> persons may go out as laborers to the <rs>Federal States</rs>, and in the next place a <num value="1000">thousand</num> muskets may go out in another ship, and when they arrive in <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName> these <num value="1000">thousand</num> laborers, having had an understanding before, may make a formal engagement and be armed with these <num value="1000">thousand</num> muskets; though if that had been done in the territory of the <rs>Queen</rs>, and on the soil of this country, it would have been an offence. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="5"> 
<head>The steam Ram question.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>There are other questions with regard to ships that have lately been prepared in this country, because these ships are not like ships which receive the usual equipment known in wars in times past, but they are themselves, without any further armament, formed for acts of offence and war. They are steam rams, which might be used for the purposes of war without ever touching the shores of the <rs>Confederate</rs> ports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Well, gentlemen, to permit ships of this kind knowingly to depart from this country, not to enter into any Confederate port, not to enter into the port of a belligerent, would, as you see, expose our good faith to great suspicion; and I feel certain that if, during our war with <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> had sent line-of-battle ships to break our blockade at <placeName key="tgn,7008258" n="1.000 7" reg="brest,finistere,bretagne,france,europe">Brest</placeName>, whatever reasons they might have urged in support of that, we should have considered it a violation of neutrality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>Such is the spirit in which I am prepared to act. Everything that the law of nations requires, everything that our law, that <sic>that</sic> Foreign Enlistment act requires, I am prepared to do, and even if it should be proved to be necessary for the preservation of our neutrality that the sanction of Parliament should be asked to further measures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>In short, to sum up, <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> Government are prepared to do everything that the duty of neutrality requires, everything that is just to a friendly nation, taking as a principle that we should do to others as we should wish to be done to ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>[Loud Cheers.] But this will not do; we will not adopt any measure that we think to be wrong.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/> As the <orgName n="House of Delegates" type="government">House of Delegates</orgName> failed to inform the world, we are unable to see how far, and in what particular, the currency is to be benefited by this bill should it become a law. There is not a country in the world, we believe, in which attempts of the same kind have not been made, and not <num value="1">one</num> instance in which they have ever been of the slightest benefit.--The present bill appears to have been more particularly suggested by the proceedings of the <name>Jacobins</name> in the convention during the early stages of the <rs>French Revolution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>These worthy legislators having issued a currency which speedily fell a <num value="1000">thousand</num> <hi rend="italics">per cent.,</hi> fell upon the wise expedient of giving it a forced circulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>They therefore passed a law from which we should have supposed this was copied had we not known the just contempt in which our philosophers of the <name>Legislature</name> hold all historical precedents, in which they declared it an offence, to be punished by the guillotine, for any man to give or receive for an assignat any sum in <rs type="color">gold</rs> or <rs type="color">silver</rs> less than its nominal value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>They also passed a law against the exportation of <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs> &mdash; punishing the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> offence with <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> labor in irons, and the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> with the guillotine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>These laws had not the smallest effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>No man wanted the assignats so badly as to give the nominal value for them in coin; and all who wanted them bought them as they had always done, at their <hi rend="italics">real</hi> value only, taking care to make the transaction secret.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>As the gold seller demanded a proper indemnification for the risk he ran, he, of course, charged a huge additional per centum for his gold, and thus contributed to run down the value of the assignats more than could have happened had the transaction been open and above board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>So far from checking exportation these laws enhanced it prodigiously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>Few people who had coin wished it to lie idle, and as they wished to invest it neither in assignats nor in the national domain, from distrust of the success of the <rs>Government</rs>, they invested it in foreign securities, bills of Exchange on <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>, <name>English</name> stocks, &#x0026;c. <placeName key="tgn,7013927" n="1.000 10" reg="Pittsburgh, Allegheny, Pennsylvania">Pitt</placeName> was even accused of opening a credit for persons thus circumstanced in order to drain <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, as much as possible, of the precious metals. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/> In <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, about the year <dateStruct value="1809--"><year reg="1809">1809</year></dateStruct>, Parliament passed a law rendering it highly penal to give more than <measure n="21s." type="currency"><num value="21">twenty-one</num> shillings</measure> for guineas of standard weight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>The consequence was, that the standard guinea disappeared from circulation altogether.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>It was carried over to the continent, where full value could be obtained for it, which could not be done in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, where the paper currency was depreciated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>The light guinea &mdash; that is, the guinea which from abrasion or clipping weighed less than sterling &mdash; almost entirely supplied the place of the new or standard guinea, upon the well known principle that when <num value="2">two</num> currencies are in circulation the inferior will always supplant the better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>Besides, no price had been fixed for the light guinea; and although greatly inferior in value, it sold readily for <measure n="24s." type="currency"><num value="24">twenty-four</num> shillings</measure>, while the foolish penal law restricted the standard guinea, just from the mint, to <measure n="21s." type="currency"><num value="21">twenty-one</num> shillings</measure>. Such was the result of an attempt to give a factitious value to a depreciated currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>It drove nearly all the good guineas out of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>In the debate on the report of the <rs>Bullion Committee</rs> in the <orgName n="House of Commons" type="government">House of Commons</orgName> in <dateStruct value="1811--"><year reg="1811">1811</year></dateStruct>, <persName n="Canning,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00207" reg="mostcommon:Canning,nomatch:0"><surname>Canning</surname></persName> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> said that penal laws forbidding the exportation of coin always, wherever they had been tried, had acted as a <hi rend="italics">premium</hi> upon exportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>At that very moment the <rs>Spanish</rs> milled dollar was circulating in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> to such an extent that it had entirely supplanted the crown piece, although the latter was, intrinsically, more valuable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>Yet <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> is, and always was, the most obstinately bigoted of all nations, except <placeName key="tgn,1000090" n="1.000 98" reg="portugal">Portugal</placeName>, in keeping up the absurd regulations against the exportation of bullion, which is the favorite policy of semi-barbarous sovereignties.--The reason of all this is obvious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>Money <hi rend="italics">will</hi> seek the point at which it can be most profitably employed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/> This silly law, however, leaves itself so completely open to evasion that, even were its object otherwise attainable, they could not be reached under its enactments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>It makes it penal to export <rs type="color">gold</rs> or <rs type="color">silver</rs> to foreign countries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>A man has only to carry his <rs type="color">gold</rs> or <rs type="color">silver</rs> to <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, which is not a foreign country, and there being no restriction there, he can do with it what it may please him to do. Indeed, the title of the act should be, &#x0022;An act to drive <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs> to the adjoining States.&#x0022; In the meantime, we venture to say, there is not a man in the <orgName n="House of Delegates" type="government">House of Delegates</orgName> who, if he wanted gold, would not at once go to the brokers, who have it, instead of <persName n="Memminger,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00208" reg="mostcommon:Memminger,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Memminger</surname></persName>, who, we dare say, has it not.
