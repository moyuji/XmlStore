<head>Report of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> The Report of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> is a very lengthy and highly important document.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>It briefly refers to the operations of the army in its several departments, and says that the campaign in <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> was certainly disastrous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>It is difficult to resist the impression that its disasters were not inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>That a Court of Enquiry to investigate the whole campaign met in <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> in <dateStruct value="-09-"><month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct>, but in consequence of the vicinity of the enemy requiring the presence of witnesses and judges at other points, it has been temporarily suspended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>It is expected soon to reassemble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>A deficiency of resources in men and provisions, rather than reverses in battle, caused the withdrawal of the army to <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">Middle</rs> Tennessee</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>He alludes to desertion, straggling, and absenteeism, and says that the effective force of the army is but little over half, or <num value="2">two</num>- <num value=".333">thirds</num> of the men whose names are on the muster rolls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>He recommends the repeal of the substitute and exemption provisions, and that all having substitutes be put back into the field, and that the privileges which Congress granted to put in substitutes can be regularly and constitutionally abrogated by the same power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>He says that no compact was entered into between the <rs>Government</rs> and the person furnishing a substitute, as has been alleged, but only a privilege which Government accorded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Instead of complaining of such abrogation, the person ought to feel gratified at what has heretofore been allowed him. He recommends an abridgement of exemptions and the conscription of them all, making details according to the wants of society at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>He says that the <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> men, when their terms expire, cannot be finally discharged, and should be retained, allowing them to choose the existing company under its present organization, in the same arm of the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>He recommends the consolidation of such companies and regiments as are reduced below a certain complement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>He pays a glowing tribute to the heroism, endurance, and unfaltering devotion of the soldiers, and of the lamented dead who yielded their lives as sacrifices upon the altar of Liberty, and closes by saying that our very reverses showing a united and determined endurance of everything for independence, must convince the enemy of the futility of his efforts to subdue us. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>And what military object is to be gained by its capture?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>We already perfectly command the entrance to the harbor, so that blockade-running has entirely ceased; we could command it no better were <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName> in our possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>Nor does it seem that <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName> can be so easily taken as some have thought.--Not only are <placeName reg="Port Johnson, Prince of Wales-Outer Ketchikan, Alaska" key="tgn,2006333">Port Johnson</placeName> and the works on <placeName reg="Sullivan's Island, Sullivan's Island, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096782">Sullivan's Island</placeName> armed with very heavy batteries, but the shores of the city and even its wharves are mounted with the heaviest guns in possession of the <rs>Confederates</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>Against these the army has no power whatever to act. <num value="1">One</num> assault has already been made upon the ruin with very unsatisfactory results &mdash; the whole party fell into a decided trap, and any other would probably share the same fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>Although harmless for the offence, it still has resistive power of a very strong character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>The lower tier of casemates cannot be destroyed; for the rubbish of the upper tiers of the work have so covered them that even the heaviest shell have no power to penetrate to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>A few men, comparatively, can still so shelter themselves that no assailing party can find cover from their deadly, because close, fire, and artillery fire added to this would make the ruins of <placeName key="tgn,2096786" n="1.000 14" reg="sumter, sumter, south carolina">Sumter</placeName> but little safer than the crater of a volcano.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>Success in an assault is therefore very doubtful, and it would be folly to run the exceeding risk of a failure when success can give no decided military advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> in general will say that the time for such discussions has passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>We agree with them in this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>Whether slavery is lawful or unlawful is not the question now. Whether Scripture and Reason are for it or against it is a matter of entire indifference to infidels and madmens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>The great practical issue is, who shall be the masters?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>The man who is absurd enough to believe that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> intend the permanent emancipation of the negro is fit for a straight jacket.

But, the subjugation of the <rs>South</rs> once accomplished, we should hear no more of abolition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>The slaves would be taken from their present masters, it is true; not <num value="1">one</num> Southern proprietor, great or small, would be permitted to own a single &#x0022;chattel,&#x0022; animate or inanimate; not a negro would be left him any more than any other description of property; but property of no kind would be abolished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>It is not in the nature of the abolitionist, or any other thief, to abolish property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>It is only a transfer to their own possession of the goods, lands, tenements, and negroes of their Southern brethren that they design and fully intend to accomplish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>They have not gone to all the expense and hard knocks of this war for the gratification of any moonshine philanthropy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>They care not whether it is lawful, or has the <name>Divine</name> sanction or any other sanction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>They simply understand that it pays, and anything that pays is their highest law and the only <name n="God" type="God">god</name> that they worship.--The ruinous results of every attempt ever made under the sun to cultivate the earth, especially in hot countries, by free negro labor, is as familiar to their minds as it is to ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>They have no more idea of permitting the <rs>South</rs> to become a Jamaica or <placeName reg="Republicana Dominicana" key="tgn,7005388">St. Domingo</placeName> than we have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>They will simply take the administration of the labor into their own humane and merciful hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>We have only to look at the cruelty of their ship captains to free white sailors, and at the marble hardness of heart which they have displayed in this war, to form a faint idea of the hell upon earth which awaits the negroes of the <rs>South</rs> should the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> once get them into their greedy and remorseless hands. </p> </div3> </div2>
