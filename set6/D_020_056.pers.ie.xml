<head>The Conservatives.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> The present generation will not be likely to forget the lesson in human nature which they have learned from the course of the <rs>Northern Conservatives</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The rupture with the <rs>South</rs> has lifted the veil from many a hypocrite who would otherwise have gone down to posterity as a prophet of truth and virtue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Never since the <rs>Divine Founder</rs> of Christianity appeared upon earth has there been such a revelation of whited sepulchres.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The Scribes and Pharisees of that day were told that the publicans and harlots should enter the kingdom of Heaven before them, and we have little doubt that the <name>Conservatives</name> of the <rs>North</rs> are as far behind the same classes as their predecessors in <placeName key="possibilities=25" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Jerusalem</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Such Scribes and Pharisees as <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Everett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Everett,nomatch:0"><surname>Everett</surname></persName>, <persName n="Cushing,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Cushing,nomatch:0"><surname>Cushing</surname></persName>, <persName n="Fillmore,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Fillmore,nomatch:0"><surname>Fillmore</surname></persName>, <persName n="Dickinson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Dickinson,nomatch:0"><surname>Dickinson</surname></persName></hi> &#x0026; Co., are neither as honest, virtuous nor manly as the rabble of New York and <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, who, in their ignorance, believe that the cause in which they are engaged is the cause of patriotism and freely expose their lives in its behalf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>We have infinitely more respect for the poor devils who compose the rank and file of the <rs>Union</rs> armies, who leave at home their wives and children to suffer the pangs of poverty, and come themselves to bear the brunt of battle, than we have for the rich, sordid, cowardly Conservatives, who have often declared that the <rs>South</rs> would be perfectly right in resisting the dominion of a sectional candidate like <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>,</hi> and that the <rs>North</rs> in like circumstances, would and ought to do the same, and yet, the very moment <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName></hi> issued his Decree of Subjugation, rallied in solid mass to his banner and vied with the blackest of <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republicans</rs> in giving every encouragement and assistance to his cause, except such as would compromise their personal safety. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> Up to the period that the war lifted the veil from these conservatives, <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs>, in their devotion to the almighty dollar, had generally come to the conclusion that the <q>&#x0022;solid men&#x0022;</q> of the land in purse and position were the <q>&#x0022;solid men&#x0022;</q> also in integrity and patriotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>They are now beginning to awake from the delusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Extreme wealth and extreme poverty are alike inimical to virtue and honesty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>True conservatism commands the respect of every <num value="1">one</num>; conservatism which guards with sleepless care the institutions, rights and prerogatives of a free people; which conserves justice, good faith, the constitution and laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>But as for the spurious thing which, under the guise of patriotism, means nothing more nor less than conservatism of cash, all honest men spit upon and abhor it. It is more base and contemptible than agrarianism, radicalism, and the rankest abolitionism. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> Let every man read the speech of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Everett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Everett,nomatch:0"><surname>Everett</surname></persName></hi> upon the <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName></hi> raid; the speech of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Fillmore,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Fillmore,nomatch:0"><surname>Fillmore</surname></persName></hi> at <placeName reg="Buffalo, Erie, New York" key="tgn,7013463">Buffalo</placeName> declaring that the <rs>South</rs> ought to resist the election of a <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> <rs type="role2">President</rs>; the speeches of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Cushing,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Cushing,nomatch:0"><surname>Cushing</surname></persName>, <persName n="Dickinson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:Dickinson,nomatch:0"><surname>Dickinson</surname></persName>, <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName></hi> and others, before the election, substantially to the same effect, and then ask &mdash; What are we to think of these men personally, individually and morally, in the light shed upon their characters by their present course?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Who can believe that <num value="1">one</num> of them differs in any way from <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Wilson,,Billy,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="default:Wilson,Billy,,,"><foreName>Billy</foreName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName>'s</hi> robbers and ravishers, except as a fear of the penitentiary and public odium makes him differ?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Who does not see that, under their more decent apparel, cleaner shirts, and better washed faces, are natures just as false, selfish and sensual as any in <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Wilson,,Billy,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="default:Wilson,Billy,,,"><foreName>Billy</foreName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName>'s</hi> gang?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Many a publican and sinner, at the <placeName key="possibilities=131" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Five Points</placeName>, will enter the kingdom of Heaven before these Scribes and Pharisees. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> If there is <num value="1">one</num> feature of this conservatism, which is as disgusting in its hypocrisy, it is its unparalleled cowardice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Not <num value="1">one</num> conservative of them all has ever dared to show his conservatism in any way but the preservation of his own precious carcass and fortune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>On peaceful anniversary days, and in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> orations, they could never say enough of the principles, and rights, and liberties, achieved in the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Revolution, but the moment these are assailed by the vulgar usurper at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, they all deserted them to a man, and, even now, when the freedom of the press in their own cities is trampled under foot, where it is treason to think peace better than war, and the dismal shadows of a large military despotism threatens <rs n="Republican" type="political">republican</rs> institutions in their own States with a total eclipse, they dare not say <num value="1">one</num> word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>And those are the men on whom the deluded <rs>South</rs> once relied for co-operation!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>They told her to the last that <hi rend="italics">they</hi> would rally to her defence, and, if she would only be patient, would, in the end, put down her enemies in the <rs>North</rs>, and compel them to do her portion!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Well is it for the <rs>South</rs> that she did not long continue to lean upon that false and feeble, and rotten reed! </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> We took occasion a short time since to compare the <name>Baboon</name> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> to the <num value="2">two</num> <rs n="Neapolitan" type="ethnic">Neapolitan</rs> tyrants, father and son, who earned the execrations of the world and of all future ages, by the reign of terror which they deliberately organized and carried out within their dominions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The charge which was made against the younger <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><foreName>Bomba</foreName></persName></hi> in the <orgName n="British Parliament" type="parliament">British Parliament</orgName>, and which contributed more than anything else to deprive him of all sympathy when he fell, was that he governed by means of the police.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Our <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><foreName>Bomba</foreName></persName> </hi> copies his example most sedulously in this respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>We are told by his organ, the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName>, that his Prime <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Seward,Minister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Minister">Minister</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>,</hi> having, we presume, nothing else to do, is engaged at this moment in organizing a system of <hi rend="italics">espionage</hi> on the <rs>French</rs> plan; that is on the plan adopted by <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><foreName>Fouche</foreName></persName></hi> in the days of the consulate and Empire, which filled every house with spies, planted distrust in every social circle, and banished peace, security and confidence from every household in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The most confidential conversations were not sacred from the prying malice of this terrible system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The nearest relatives knew not how to trust each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The father knew not that his son might not be a spy upon his actions; the mother knew not that she might not be denounced by her own daughter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Ineradicable suspicion was sown between husband and wife, brother and sister, master and servant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Each felt that the other held his life in his hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Such was the system which <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00030" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName></hi> is employed in imitating, and such were its results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>It was copied with improvements by the <num value="2">two</num> <hi rend="smallcaps">Bombas,</hi> and the younger of them lost his crown for the offence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>When <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Garibaldi,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00031" reg="mostcommon:Garibaldi,nomatch:0"><surname>Garibaldi</surname></persName></hi> came to try conclusions with him, he found scarcely anybody among his <num value="9000000">nine millions</num> of subjects to stand at his back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The invader walked through his territories, as though he were leading a holiday procession. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/> Yet it was not either their chains or their dungeons, their police or their spies, that formed the most damning accusation against the <hi rend="smallcaps">Bombas.</hi> <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> The crowning act of outrage in the case of each was the bombardment of his own cities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/><hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><foreName>Bomba</foreName></persName></hi> the older bombarded <placeName key="tgn,7004474" n="1.000 3" reg="napoli,napoli,campania,italia,europe">Naples</placeName>, and <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><foreName>Bomba</foreName></persName></hi> the younger bombarded <placeName key="tgn,7003928" n="1.000 2" reg="palermo,palermo,sicilia,italia,europe">Palermo</placeName>.--Outraged humanity, all over the world, rose up against these atrocious deeds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>There is nothing to justify it in any military code known to the whole world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Yet our <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><foreName>Bomba</foreName></persName></hi> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> proposes to imitate the example.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>We are told by his miserable tool, the <orgName n="Baltimore American" type="newspaper">Baltimore <hi rend="italics">American</hi></orgName>, that he is erecting batteries <hi rend="italics">to command the city,</hi> upon <placeName key="tgn,2324273" n="1.000 1" reg="federal hill, harford, maryland">Federal Hill</placeName>, and we are given to understand that, upon the approach of a Confederate force, he means to burn it to the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>We hardly know how to believe that he can be meditating a crime so horrible, and we should not believe it, had he not taken pains to render us incapable of surprise at anything he may do. Were he not capable of entertaining thoughts at least as bad, he never would have sanctioned the proclamation of that <q>&#x0022;bastard brat of a vagabond fiddler,&#x0022;</q> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Fremont,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00032" reg="mostcommon:Fremont,nomatch:0"><surname>Fremont</surname></persName>,</hi> in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>We need not picture to our readers the horror of a bombardment in such a city as <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, where the population is <num value="230000">230,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>We have but <num value="1">one</num> hope in the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>We can hardly believe that a Government which needs, more than any other, the good opinion of foreign powers, would forfeit it by an act of such unparalleled atrocity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>We say unparalleled, for the <rs n="Neapolitan" type="ethnic">Neapolitan</rs> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><foreName>Bomba</foreName></persName></hi> was anointed <persName n="King,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00033" reg="nearbymention:King,Rufus,,,"><surname>King</surname></persName>, and considered his power to be derived immediately from above.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>But this man was elected to preside for only <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>, and professes to hold his authority from the people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/> While we should deprecate the destruction of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> as a deed of unalloyed and unapproachable wickedness, and deplore it for the sake of those among its noble inhabitants who are embarked in the same cause with our selves, and execrate the authors as enemies of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and the human race, we are convinced that it would add tenfold strength to the <rs>Confederate</rs> cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>All earth would rise up as <num value="1">one</num> man to curse the perpetrators of such an atrocity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>The very stones in the fields &mdash; the very bricks in the cities, would rise up against them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>They would soon have cause to rue the hour in which they <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> dreamed of such a crime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>The civilized nations of the earth would make common cause against men thus proving themselves worse than barbarians.--It would be no violation of international law to hang up like dogs, wherever caught, the authors and instigators, from the <rs>President</rs> in the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName> to the officers directing the conflagration. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/> The <orgName n="Military Board" type="board">Military Board of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName></orgName> is not responsible for the <rs>Hatteras</rs> disaster, as can be easily demonstrated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Under its direction the forts at <placeName reg="Oregon" key="tgn,7007708">Oregon</placeName>, <placeName reg="Fort Ocracoke">Ocracoke</placeName> and <persName n="Hatteras,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="mostcommon:Hatteras,nomatch:0"><surname>Hatteras</surname></persName> were built, provided with all the ordnance, &#x0026;c., at the command of the <rs>State</rs>, and then handed over to the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/><placeName reg="Fort Hatteras">Fort Hatteras</placeName> was not under the control of the <orgName n="Military Board" type="board">Military Board</orgName> at the time of the attack, the formal transfer of the work having been completed on the <date value="08-20">20th of August,</date> and hence it was not the duty of the <rs>Governor</rs> of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> and his advisors to make requisitions for ordnance, &#x0026;c., as you seem to imply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>You will thus perceive that, if there be any culpability in this regard, it cannot by any possibility rest upon the <orgName n="Military Board" type="board">Military Board of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName></orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/> So far from deserving censure this Board has merited the gratitude of the public &mdash; Whatever of service the <rs>State</rs> has rendered to the <rs>Southern</rs> cause within the last few months, has really been effected through its instrumentality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Under the sagacious and efficient policy inaugurated by it, the forts have been built at great expense and infinite trouble, upon the most barren of beaches, at a long distance from the main land, and in localities to which it was necessary to transport everything save the sand used in the construction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>A regiment has likewise been raised for the coast defence in the <rs>Eastern</rs> section of the <rs>State</rs>, composed of the very flower of <placeName reg="Carolina City, Carteret, North Carolina" key="tgn,2222249">Carolina</placeName>'s chivalry, and every effort made to perfect it in the <orgName n="Heavy Artillery" type="artillery">heavy artillery</orgName> drill, so as to prepare for emergencies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Nor is this all. <placeName key="tgn,2335384" n="1.000 16" reg="fort macon, carteret, north carolina">Forts Macon</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,2074695" n="1.000 6" reg="fort caswell, brunswick, north carolina">Caswell</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7014522" n="1.000 4" reg="southport, brunswick, north carolina">Johnston</placeName> have been repaired, strengthened, reinforced and rendered impregnable &mdash; a work of herculean labor, as all must admit who are acquainted with the facts of the case. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/> In addition to these things, let me point you to the splendid regiments which this Board has raised, equipped, and sent to <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, to fight the battles of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>In a word, sirs, much of the praise which, by universal consent, is lavished upon <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, because of the efficient aid she has given to her sister States in their hour of peril, belongs as a matter of necessity to this Board, since it has been the agency through which the good work has been planned, developed and executed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/> To the <rs>Honorable Warren Winslow</rs>, the able and patriotic <rs type="role2">Secretary</rs> of this Board, the <rs>State</rs>, and indeed the whole country, is under special obligations; and when the history of these stirring times are written by some impartial historian, it will be found that no Southern man has a prouder, purer, or more honorable record. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>Our artillery were posted on the brow of the hill which we occupy, commanding the main road, while to the right and left our infantry lines extended, protected by some has <unclear>y</unclear> thrown up rail breastworks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>The enemy did not attack us, however, and at nightfall our men were ordered to stand upon their arms all night, while our horses stood under their saddler, and their riders slept in their boots and spurs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/> During the night our scouts brought us accurate information as to the position of the enemy, and <persName n="Floyd,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00171" reg="nearbymention:Floyd,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName> determined to attack him near the dawn of morning.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/> at <time value="4am">four o'clock A. M.</time> The Brigade was in motion, and the clear ring of the <rs>General</rs>'s <unclear> ntorian</unclear> voice was heard along the lines in the fresh morning air like the blast of a trumpet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>We were all instantly to our arms and to our saddles, and advanced rapidly at double quick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>A heavy fog hung over the hills and along the valleys, and we approached almost upon the enemy's pickets before they saw us. They fired and far, distinctly in our view and not a <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> in our advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>Our men gave a shout at the sound of that sort of music, and dashed on with accelerated speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>In a few minutes we discovered the blue coats of the enemy, as they stood drawn up in line near a church by the road side, while to our right, and behind a fence, stood another column of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>As soon as <orgName n="regiment"><persName n="Heth,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00175" reg="mostcommon:Heth,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Heth</surname></persName>'s regiment</orgName> emerged from the woods into the open field, which commanded the church, they opened fire, and, after a few rounds, the enemy hastily retreated across a <unclear></unclear> and to the brow of a precipitate and commanding hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>In the meantime, <orgName n="regiment"><persName n="Reynolds,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00176" reg="nearbymention:Reynolds,Frank,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Reynolds</surname></persName>' regiment</orgName> had opened on the enemy upon the right, and they, too, were soon made to beat a precipitate retreat, as shout on shout of our men rent the air. <persName n="Floyd,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00177" reg="nearbymention:Floyd,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName> then gave the command to throw down the fence on the right of the road, and charge the enemy on the hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>In an instant, and almost at a single stroke of the arm, the fence went down, and our men, led on by their gallant <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs> (<persName n="Heth,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00178" reg="mostcommon:Heth,nomatch:0"><surname>Heth</surname></persName>,) dashed across the corn-field and charged to the top of the hill, driving the enemy to a still higher eminence, completely commanding the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>Here the sharpest part of the conflict occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>The enemy maintained their position with considerable obstinacy, wounding several of our men and killing some. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/> our fire becoming too hot again for the enemy, they retired to an adjoining wood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>Again our men dashed on to the charge, ascending the brow of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> hill, and shooting as they went.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>At this stage <rs type="role2">Capt</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/><orgName n="Jackson Artillery" type="artillery">Jackson's artillery</orgName> was hurried to the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>It came dashing through the field and to the brow of the hill, and letting fly <num value="2">two</num> rounds, the enemy disappeared through the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>In the meantime, <orgName n="artillery"><persName n="Hart,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00179" reg="mostcommon:Hart,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Hart</surname></persName>'s artillery</orgName> had crossed the field and ascended an adjoining hill, but not in time to give the enemy a few of his grape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>The <rs n="Hessian" type="ethnic">Hessians</rs> were now in full retreat on all hands, and as they descended from the hill to the raving and road upon the other side, <persName n="McCanklin,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00180" reg="mostcommon:McCanklin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>McCanklin</surname></persName> pitched into them with his force, when the whole broke and took to the woods, every man for himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>Had not the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs> ran before his men, he would doubtless have been captured by this part of our force. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/> Pursuit was immediately determined upon by our General.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>On our gallant men rushed in more than double quick time, and continued the <rs>Pursuit</rs> for some <num value="8">eight</num> or <measure n="10miles" type="distance">ten miles</measure>, but with no other result than the capture of a number of prisoners, <num value="4">four</num> baggage waggons, <num value="1">one</num> ambulance, and several guns and other articles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>A fine chest of medicines was captured, which is now in the hands of my friend, <persName n="Gleaves,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00181" reg="mostcommon:Gleaves,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Gleaves</surname></persName>, from <placeName key="tgn,2115154" n="1.000 60" reg="wytheville, wythe, virginia">Wytheville</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/> we attacked the enemy so early and unexpectedly that they evidently had to leave without breakfast, for, as we passed their camp, bushels of sicken roasting earn, quantities of beef, pigs and bread were found on their fires. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/> I have not learned the loss of the enemy, but it was several killed, many wounded, and still a greater number taken prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>All of them were Chioans, and we learned from them that <persName n="Tyler,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00182" reg="mostcommon:Tyler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Tyler</surname></persName>, his <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</rs>, <rs type="role2">Surgeon</rs> and preacher, all ran soon after the engagement opened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/><num value="1">One</num> of them died before we left, and some of the rest will. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/> As an evidence of our men's good marksmanship, it may be stated that nearly every <num value="1">one</num> of the wounded are shot above the legs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>I remember but <num value="2">two</num> exceptions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/><num value="1">One</num> fellow was shot in the forehead, the ball passing obliquely out near the back of the right ear, and, remarkable to say, he is still living and rational.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>Some of them are polite and communicative, some educated and well bred, and some sullen and insolent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/> On yesterday a large buck negro, body-servant of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <rs type="role2">Major</rs>, was brought in with the <rs>Secretary</rs> to the <rs>Colonel</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>They were arrested some <measure n="8miles" type="distance">eight miles distant</measure> from the battle field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>The negro was frightened out of his wits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>He told us he was servant to the <rs>Major</rs>, who was to pay him <measure n="50dollars" type="currency">fifty dollars</measure> per month, which he thought was better than he could do at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>He had been paid nothing, however, as yet. He started in the retreat with his master, but before going far, he passed <num value="1">one</num> of his regiment, shot in the leg, who asked him for some water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>He jumped from his horse, and dashed off to a branch near by to fill his canteen, and while engaged in this errand of mercy, a fleeing column of his <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> friends passed, <num value="1">one</num> of whom, in his anxiety to escape, mounted his horse, and dashed off to the great discomfiture of the negro, and leaving him to foot it as best he could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>But for this accident, he said he should have escaped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>He was exceedingly solicitous to know what would be done with him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/>From our lofty position we could distinctly see the camp fires of the enemy on <placeName reg="Cheat Mountain, West Virginia, West Virginia" key="tgn,2234058">Cheat Mountain</placeName>, and my companion told me that, on a clear day, the tents were readily descried with the naked eye.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>The roads, for a few miles before reaching said place, are the worst I ever saw, being well high impassable even to an equestrian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>I am satisfied of this, that the movements in the <rs>Northwest</rs> are now conducted on a plan, and that when a blow is struck it will be a well-directed <num value="1">one</num>.
