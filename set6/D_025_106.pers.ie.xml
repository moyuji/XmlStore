<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> The enemy has gained important advantages within the last <measure n="48hours" type="date">forty-eight hours</measure>, which, unless they are counteracted in some way, will place the question of subsisting his army in <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> this winter beyond all doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>But before proceeding further, permit me to correct as error into which I fell in my letter of yesterday. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> The point at which the enemy laid the pontoon bridges yesterday morning is <placeName reg="Brown's Ferry">Brown's Ferry</placeName>, <placeName><distance reg="4.5miles">four and a half miles</distance> below <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName></placeName> by the river, or a mile and <num value="0.5">a half</num> by land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>To reach the ferry by land you cross the river in the rear of the town and the <rs>Moccasin</rs>, or neck of land below, which is very narrow, though the distance around it is considerable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> Having constructed their pontoon boats and placed the bridge timber aboard, the pontoneers and the expeditionary forces embarked night before last at <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, and under cover of darkness proceeded quietly down the river to the ferry, where the troops landed, leaving the pontoneers in charge of the boats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Our cavalry <unclear></unclear> along the river bank, according to report, were asleep, and of course were taken in their blankets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Advancing up the hill, called by some <placeName key="possibilities=82" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Sand Hill</placeName>, overlooking the river, the <rs>Federal</rs> came suddenly upon <persName n="Gen,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Gen,nomatch:0"><surname>Gen</surname></persName>. <orgName n="Law's Infantry"><persName n="Law,Infantry,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Law,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Infantry"></roleName><surname>Law</surname></persName>'s infantry</orgName> pickets &mdash; all of whom but <num value="1">one</num> man are reported to have followed the example of the <unclear>vide,</unclear> and gone to sleep &mdash; captured most of them or drove them in, and gained possession of the hill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The solitary picket who was awake discharged his piece, and this called up <persName n="Oates,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Oates,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Oates</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="AL15">15th Alabama</orgName>, who immediately deployed his regiment as skirmishers, and advanced against the enemy; but finding that their line of battle overlapped his line of skirmishers at both ends, he fell back, leaving the foe in undisputed possession of the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>This occurred just before day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> Meanwhile, the pontoneers, as soon as the success of the movement had become assured went to work and laid down the bridge at the ferry, when heavy reinforcements, which had proceeded by the land route, across the <rs>Moccasin</rs> or narrow tongue of land in the lower corner of the <unclear></unclear>, passed over the river and commenced throwing up defensive works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The bridge is in full view of Look out point, and not exceeding <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles distant</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> But this is not all. A considerable force reached the scene this afternoon from <placeName reg="Bridgeport, Cocke, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098103">Bridgeport</placeName>, having marched upon the south side of the river, along the railroad route.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The column was preceded by a force of <num value="800">eight hundred</num> or a <num value="1000">thousand</num> cavalry and brought with it artillery and a wagon train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>A scout, who hovered along the mountains and watched the movements of the column, informs me that it started from <placeName reg="Shell Mound, Martin, Indiana" key="tgn,2657880">Shell Mound</placeName>, <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> this side of <placeName reg="Bridgeport, Cocke, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098103">Bridgeport</placeName>, at <time value="12pm">noon</time> <time>yesterday</time>, and that a considerable body of troops remained behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The enemy was laying a pontoon bridge across the river at <placeName reg="Shell Mound, Martin, Indiana" key="tgn,2657880">Shell Mound</placeName> when he left. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> The enemy now holds the south bank of the river, and the railroad from <placeName reg="Bridgeport, Cocke, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098103">Bridgeport</placeName> to <placeName reg="Brown's Ferry">Brown's Ferry</placeName>.
