<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The news yesterday which was chiefly discussed was the remarkable surrender to the enemy of <placeName reg="Fort Gaines, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,2335258">Fort Gaines</placeName>, at the entrance of <placeName reg="Mobile Bay, Alabama, United States" key="tgn,7017443">Mobile bay</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The particulars of the affair are given in the telegraph column; and we need only give the position as it now stands; At the outlet of <placeName reg="Mobile Bay, Alabama, United States" key="tgn,7017443">Mobile bay</placeName> into the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> there are <num value="2">two</num> channels running either side of <placeName reg="Dauphin Island, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,1006923">Dauphin island</placeName> &mdash; that on the right passing very close to <placeName reg="Fort Gaines, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,2335258">Fort Gaines</placeName>, and that on the left passing not so close to <placeName key="tgn,7013918" n="1.000 18" reg="fort morgan, baldwin, alabama">Fort Morgan</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>While the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> fleet passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/><placeName reg="Fort Gaines, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,2335258">Fort Gaines</placeName> successfully, yet before operations against <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName> could have been commenced, it would have been necessary, to have reduced that work, which is a very strong <num value="1">one</num>, and which was provisioned for <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>. Until it was reduced their transports, with provisions could not come in nor leave <placeName reg="Mobile Bay, Alabama, United States" key="tgn,7017443">Mobile bay</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The work is situated on a barren flat point, commanding the country around it as far as its guns could throw, and could not have been taken by a land assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/><placeName reg="Fort Powell">Fort Powell</placeName>, which is on the same side of the bay with <persName n="Gaines,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Gaines,nomatch:0"><surname>Gaines</surname></persName>, was evacuated by our forces and destroyed, as it was no longer of any use after the fall of the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/><placeName key="tgn,7013918" n="1.000 18" reg="fort morgan, baldwin, alabama">Fort Morgan</placeName> will doubtless now have to be given up, thus leaving the entrance to <placeName reg="Mobile Bay, Alabama, United States" key="tgn,7017443">Mobile bay</placeName> open.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>We have before stated that the passage of these forts did not place <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName> in imminent peril, and we may now add that neither does the fall of these works do so. The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have not commenced on their work &mdash; the obstructions have not been reached, and, in fact, the &#x0022;siege of <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>&#x0022; lies some weeks yet in the future. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>There were a number of street rumors yesterday, the general tenor of which was that <persName n="McCausland,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:McCausland,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Generals</roleName> <surname>McCausland</surname></persName> and <persName n="Johnson,General,Bradley,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="default:Johnson,Bradley,,,"><roleName n="General"></roleName><foreName>Bradley</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName> had been surprised at <placeName key="tgn,2119267" n="1.000 37" reg="moorefield, hardy, west virginia">Moorefield</placeName>; <placeName reg="Hardy, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002266">Hardy county</placeName>, and had lost some <num value="400">four-hundred</num> men and several guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>We could not trace this to any reliable source, and think it probable that it is a repetition, in another form, of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> boasts that they had whipped our cavalry at <placeName reg="Cumberland, Allegany, Maryland" key="tgn,2046811">Cumberland</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>There was nothing new from <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The shelling had been pretty much discontinued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>It is still reported that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> is removing troops from his present position, and a citizen who came over yesterday evening says that he is certainly shifting the guns at <orgName type="battery" n="Battery 5">Battery No. 5</orgName>; but whether they are being removed or replaced with others of different calibre could not be ascertained. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>There was a heavy explosion heard yesterday afternoon on the <rs type="place">Chesterfield Peninsula</rs>, and a heavy smoke was seen shortly after in a straight line east from <persName n="Dunlop,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Dunlop,nomatch:0"><surname>Dunlop</surname></persName>'s, on the <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>What can they be waiting for? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/> A single circumstance connected with this stupendous victory is, that it was gained over a single <orgName>corps of <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00170" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName></orgName>'s <orgName n="army">army</orgName>, and that corps still retains its organization in spite of such a tremendous loss!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>What a large <hi rend="italics">corps</hi> it must have been, and what a prodigious Army <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00171" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName> must have under his command !

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/> But the most singular thing of all, is that there should be a General bold enough to make such a statement as this to an army which had just been signally defeated, and must have known the truth of the case; a <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> which could tolerate such a gross falsehood; and a people, to whose general and secretary would dare to publish it. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/> A short time will probably solve the next plans of this army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/><num value="1">One</num> thing is certain, and that is, if its commanders keep it where it is through the present and ensuing months, death will do much to thin their ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>The Confederate cause will be assisted not a little by that determination on their part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>It would have been infinitely preferable to us to have had a general engagement with the enemy on the north bank of the <placeName reg="Chickahominy, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1122759">Chickahominy</placeName>, or even on the south bank of the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James</placeName>, immediately after <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00173" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> slided over on that side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>But as such a trial of conclusions could not be had then, and at those places, we are just as well off now to let disease work its telling effects on the army of Northern men, hemmed in, as they are, on the flat land and swamps of the <rs>Appomattox</rs> and the <rs>James</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>It is better that our enemies should be nursed <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and then die, than that we should have to hazard our men's lives and use our ammunition in the killing of them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/> We should not be surprised, however, to see the grand army that crossed the <rs>Rapidan</rs> in <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> to take <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and wind up the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, depart, bag and baggage, in a very few days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>All its plans have failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>Its own presses confess that it has nothing to do and nothing to hope for where it is; but must sit down in inglorious idleness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>A position so ridiculous, and <num value="1">one</num>, indeed, so uncomfortable and unhealthy--<num value="1">one</num> in which they must lose <num value="1000">thousands</num> by disease &mdash; could not be persistently held but in madness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>Should they do so, however, they can do us no harm; while our large force, hanging upon the <rs>Southern</rs> line of the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>, will be able to retaliate at least some portion of the vast robberies and destruction the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> hordes have perpetrated in the <name>States</name> of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and imperil <placeName reg="District of Columbia" key="tgn,7013962">Washington city</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/> But the indications, of late, discourage the idea that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army will remain here, where its labors are at an end, simply to die. There is too much restiveness at the <rs>North</rs>--too much fear of the invasion from the <rs>South</rs>--and the <rs>Federal</rs> <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> will be glad to avail itself of that feeling to leave its painful position and go to the <rs>North</rs> for the defence of their homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>Thus it is likely we shall have the old conclusion of the campaign by heavy battles on the <rs>Potomac</rs>; but we feel assumed that those battles will not terminate with advantage to neither side, as in former years. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/> --We were informed early in <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> that the demand for army supplies was so urgent that your Department felt constrained to disregard our schedule prices then in force, and offer market rates to the formers for their wheat, if delivered in <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>The policy was deemed indispensable to insure the <name>Early</name> receipt of supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>Concurring with the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War. Department</orgName> in the paramount importance of obtaining, at the earliest practicable period, an ample quantity of wheat for the support of the army, we apprehended, as so great a disparity elated between our former rates and the rates then offering in our leading cities, that unless we advanced prices our action might seriously embarrass the government in their efforts to obtain immediate supplies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/> Under these circumstances, and owing to the very short crop of wheat and unprecedented demand for broad stuffs, together with the depredation in the currency, as well as to the further fact that the farmers were then securing the oat and hay crepe, we proposed the advanced prices set forth in our <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><month>August</month></dateStruct> schedules. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/> But now, as the immediate wants of the army are being provided for, and vigorous efforts are initiated to reduce the currency and <sic>relastate</sic> public credit, we are disposed to accept the recent manifestations of public opinion in regard to our prices as the strongest assurance that in future adequate supplies can be secured on very moderate terms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/> As the press, the public, and the farmers in part, have all united in condemning our rates as too high, we therefore Defer to what seems to be the general desire and prepaid the following prices: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/> Having re-adopted the <name>Schedules</name> for <dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><month>June</month></dateStruct> last, in accordance with the clearly- manifested wishes of the people, we have thought it advisable and proper to stimulate the sale and delivery of small grain &#x0026;c, now so much needed as to be indispensable, by advancing the price of wheat, flour, corn and <rs n="corn meal" type="product">corn meal</rs>, oats and hay, delivered in the month of <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/> Therefore we place the price of wheat at <measure n="7.50dollars" type="currency">$7.50</measure> per bushel, and a corresponding advance of <num value="50">50</num> percents all the grades of flour, mill-offal, &#x0026;c; and corn we assess at <measure n="6dollars" type="currency">$6</measure> per bushel, and <rs n="corn meal" type="product">corn meal</rs> at <measure n="6.30dollars" type="currency">$6.30</measure> per bushel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>Oats and hay, per <measure n="100l." type="pounds"><num value="100">hundred</num> pounds</measure> unbaled, at <measure n="6dollars" type="currency">$6</measure>, and at <measure n="7dollars" type="currency">$7</measure> per <measure n="100l." type="pounds"><num value="100">hundred</num> pounds</measure>, baled east of the <rs type="place">Blue Ridge</rs>, and delivered during the month of <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/> <rs n="railroad iron" type="product">Railroad iron</rs> not being included in the <rs>Government</rs> contradts with the iron manufactories, should not have been advanced in our last Schedules.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>So we re-adopt our old valuation for <rs n="railroad iron" type="product">railroad iron</rs>, and put the price at <measure n="90dollars" type="currency">$90</measure> per ton. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/> The foregoing are to be the prices of wheat, flour, mill-offal, corn and <rs n="corn meal" type="product">corn meal</rs>, oats, hay and <rs n="railroad iron" type="product">railroad iron</rs>, delivered during the month of <dateStruct value="-08-"><month reg="08">August</month></dateStruct>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/> In <dateStruct value="-09-"><month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct> we propose to adopt simply the former Schedules for <dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><month>June</month></dateStruct>, with the exception of the assessment upon <rs n="railroad iron" type="product">railroad iron</rs>, which we wish to continue at <measure n="120dollars" type="currency">$120</measure> per ton during the month of <dateStruct value="-09-"><month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/> We also re-adopt the revision of our <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> and March Schedule in reference to the impressment of horses, as published in our <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> Schedule. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/> We trust that the people in those counties who have recently; in public meetings, expressed their views in favor of low prices will now, since all impediments have been removed, as patriotically load out in tendering and selling, both to the <rs>Government</rs> and to the people, all they can spare, at Schedule rates. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/> Such an example voluntarily act before the people would exert a most salutary influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>The public may be assured we will interpose no barrier to thwart either their benevolent intentions or generous contributions in behalf of their country. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/> In assessing the average value of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class artillery and wagon horses and mules at <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">$500</measure> we designed that the term should be accepted and acted upon according to its obvious common sense import.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>In other words, that they should be selected, and then impressed according as their working qualities and adaptation to army service, together with their intrinsic value, would warrant a judicious purchaser in considering them as coming within the contemplation of the commissioners when they assessed the average value of such horses as the government needed at <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">$500</measure>; but cases might arise, however, when the public exigencies would be so urgent as to demand that <hi rend="italics">all horses</hi> at hand should be impressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>Yet. under ordinary circumstances, when family or extra blooded horses, or brood mares of <hi rend="italics">admitted high value are</hi> impressed, we respectfully suggest to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> to have instructions forwarded to the impressing officers to propose and allow the owners to <hi rend="italics">substitute</hi> in their stead such strong, sound, and serviceable horses or mules as shall be considered and valued by competent and disinterested parties as <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class artillery horses or <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class wagon mules. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/> The terms average value per head is in contradistinction to a fixed and uniform price for each horse or mules.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>we supposed that in impressing a number of horses or mules, whether owned by several persons or <num value="1">one</num> individual, that some might be estimated at <measure n="300dollars" type="currency">$300</measure>, and others at different advanced rates, according to their worth, up as high as <measure n="700dollars" type="currency">$700</measure>--thus making <hi rend="italics">an-average</hi> value or price for a <hi rend="italics">number</hi> of good, sound, and efficient horses or mules <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">$500</measure> each. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/> In illustration of our views, we will add that a horse with only <num value="1">one</num> eye sound might, in all other respects, he classed as a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class artillery horse, yet the loss of <num value="1">one</num> eye would justly and considerably curtail his value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>So a horse from <num value="10">ten</num> to <measure n="13years" type="date">thirteen years</measure> of age might be deemed in all other particulars as a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class artillery horse, but, of course, however efficient, or able to render good service for a year or so, yet his advanced age would justly and materially impair his value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>Any horse, however he may approximate the standard of a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class artillery horse, must, according to deficiencies, fall below the maximum price; and as few comparatively come up to the standard, and, therefore, are entitled to the maximum price, so of course in all other instances the price should be proportionately reduced as imperfections place them below the standard of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class, &#x0026;c. </p> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/> Since the adoption of our Schedules for the months of <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><month>March</month></dateStruct>, the financial bills passed by Congress taxing the currency have seriously impaired the value of the old issues of <orgName n="Confederate Treasury notes" type="org">Confederate Treasury notes</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>At this juncture large numbers of horses and mules were impressed and paid for in a currency which was in a few days thereafter to be taxed <num value="33">thirty three</num> and <num value="1">one</num>- <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> per cent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/> The <orgName n="State Board" type="board">Board of State</orgName> Commissioners having adjourned, and <num value="1">one</num> of its members being out of the <rs>State</rs>, it could not be convened in time to review our schedules of prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>Under this state of facts, we have re-examined re-arranged our tariff of prices, so far as we have been advised of recent impressments, proposing in this mode to render any diminution of valuation which may have resulted from the action of Congress upon the currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>Therefore, we stress the <hi rend="italics">average</hi> value of artillery or wagon horses or mules, imperiled since the passage of the currency, bill of the <dateStruct value="-02-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> <month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> last, at <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">$600</measure>. This award will entitle each person to receive higher compensation, accordingly as each herro or mule recently impressed may be considered as being a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, or <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> close artillery or wagon horse or mule, whether the parties appeal to our Board or not; and the impressing agents and officers should forth-with call on all of those persons of whom they impressed horses or mule and propose a settlement upon the foregoing basis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>But allowing to each person only such prices as <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, and <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> class artillery or wagon horses or mules may have been estimated at by the local or county appraisers, assuming our average appraisement, <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">$600</measure>, as a fair medium valuation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>This, then, would allow a maximum price of <measure n="800dollars" type="currency">$800</measure> and a minimum price of <measure n="400dollars" type="currency">$400</measure>, making <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">$600</measure> the average price &mdash; thus allowing more for <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class horses or mules, and proportionately less for the inferior, as they may fail below the grade of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class.
