<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/> The <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> has the following account of some night scenes in <placeName reg="London, Madison, Ohio" key="tgn,2080432">London</placeName>, curiously illustrative of some of the statements made by <persName n="Kay,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00035" reg="mostcommon:Kay,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Kay</surname></persName> in his work on the &#x0022;Social Condition of the <rs>English People</rs>:&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/> A few evenings ago, a little before <time value="6oclock">6 o'clock</time>, when the darkness was heavy and damp with that slow, incessant <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> rain, which seems to creep under any shelter and to spread its cold touch over every part of the body, any unwilling passenger who had to pass at the back of the unifocal gallery would have noticed a close crowd of more than <num value="40">forty</num> persons pressing <num value="1">one</num> of the doors of St. Martha's work house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>He would have found that they were waiting for the opening of the casual ward in the hope of obtaining a night's shelter and a little food. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/> If he went up to them he would have seen them puddled together for warmth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>They would have taken little notice of him, except that a man on the outside of the circle might glance uneasily at him, and edge away as if he did not like to be seen; and, as if moved by a sense of suspicion, whisper to the stranger, &#x0022;I never did this in my life before.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/> The work-house only admits, as a rule, <num value="12">twelve</num> men and <num value="12">twelve</num> women, and some of them must have the door shut against them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>The door soon opens, and all their eyes fasten on a burley, well dressed, well-combed, well brushed official, the greatest possible contrast to the ring of paleness, squalor, and dirt outside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>He is well accustomed to this sort of sight, and there is a quite business like coolness about his manner in the strange contrast with the eager, imploring stare of the helpless faces below him. He surveys the group carefully, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to see if there are any who have been there before; for it will not do to allow the casual ward to become an ordinary refuge to any <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>As he is sure to have to turn away some, he will admit those who have not been there before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>It is too great a luxury to be enjoyed by any <num value="1">one</num> <num value="2">two</num> nights running. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/> At last he makes a sign, and <num value="1">one</num> woman passed in, and another, and another, up to a dozen or so, and then a pale, weary-looking woman, with young features, but aged looking hair, is pushed on <num value="1">one</num> side, not roughly, but irresistibly by his arm, and her head drops back and her eyes close despairingly as she falls away into the rain-fog.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>Then he looks around at the men and admits a few of them, pushing <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> of them back with a touch of roughness he hardly showed the women. &#x0022;Don't tell me no lies&#x0022; he says sharply, to <num value="1">one</num> who assures him &#x0022;I wasn't here last night, sir,&#x0022; in a tone which seems to imply that he knows why he is rejected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>Fewer of them are admitted than of the women, but there are still about a dozen and <num value="0.5">a half</num> men and women outside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>It is very wet, sir,&#x0022; says a pious woman's voice. &#x0022;I know it is wet,&#x0022; he says, as though the circumstances were quite familiar to him, &#x0022;but I haven't room for all of you.&#x0022;After a word with the authorities behind he admits <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> more, and the door shuts quietly, but inevitably; and it is no good for those who remain to look up at the light above the door and hope for warmth within, and they turn their faces away to the night. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/> They do not grumble; the mass of them hardly make <num value="1">one</num> murmur; they know their fate, and it is inevitable, and they submit in passive despair.--<sic>Onle</sic> <num value="1">one</num> <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> woman begins to raise a wall of complaint, and seems, alone of them all, inclined to relieve herself by hard words against the work house authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>They break the circle and begin to shrink away, but, as the <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> woman turns and sees a gentleman waiting behind, she raises her voice to a louder and directer tone of complaint; and then the others, who seemed to want even spirit enough to beg, follow her loud and less sensitive example, and gather in a doubtful and less puzzled circle around the stranger; and then when he can get the <name>Irishwoman</name> to be quiet, he may hear, in dull, impassive tones, where the helpless creatures come from and what they have been doing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>It is always the same story: &#x0022;No work for <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>.&#x0022; &#x0022;It has been a dull time for trade.&#x0022; some &#x0022;have had no work since summer.&#x0022; </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>If they are asked what they will do, they shrug themselves and say they suppose they must sleep on the stones; they can get a lodging in St. Giles for <measure n="3d." type="currency"><num value="3">three</num> pence</measure>. That half hopeless <unclear></unclear> is the only approach they make to beg. It is night, and a man must have a hard heart to have witnessed and questioned their misery and not give them enough to get a lodging all around; and then, with the strange confidence of fellow despair, those who have the money will be trusted to go and get lodgings, and the remainder will linger until they are stretched under the cold shelter of a door in the wall of the work-house. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/> We believe a similar scene, sometimes worse than this, is to be witnessed nearly every night at the door of <placeName reg="Saint Martin" key="tgn,7004782">St. Martin</placeName>'s work-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>At almost any hour of the night men and women may be seen huddled all together on the steps of the <rs type="place">National gallery</rs> or the doorsteps of the house &mdash; the men often with no coat, a torn and filthy shirt, and useless shoes, and the women in ragged, wet, and filthy dresses, which hang about them in still more desolate rain than even the broken down appearance of the men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/> Or, more pitiable still, <num value="1">one</num> may come upon an undistinguishable lump of rags, and on bending down to examine it, finds it to be a girl bent up with her head between her knees, shrinking from the weather in the bare recess of a door step, and asleep; and it seems more charitable to leave her to forget her misery for an hour or <num value="2">two</num> than to give her something, and wake her again to desolation. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/> Immediately on discovering the absence of these prisoners some excitement was created among the <rs>Confederate</rs> officers in charge of the prison, and in a short time every means was adopted to ascertain the manner of their escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <persName n="Turner,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00075" reg="mostcommon:Turner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Turner</surname></persName> was inclined to the opinion that the sentinels on duty had been bribed to pass them out, and this impression was strengthened by the assertion of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> remaining behind that the work had been accomplished through means of heavy fees, which had been paid a <orgName n="Confederate Officer" type="org">Confederate officer</orgName> in the building, and his influence over the guard in their behalf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>On learning this the order was given to place the guard under arrest and commit them to <placeName reg="Castle Thunder">Castle Thunder</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>Not feeling satisfied about the matter, the <rs>Major</rs> and <persName n="Latouche,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00076" reg="mostcommon:Latouche,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lt.</roleName> <surname>Latouche</surname></persName> determined to leave no stone unturned to ferret out the mystery, and thereupon proceeded to institute a search in every direction for further information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>After a fruitless examination of every part of the building where it was thought possible for a man to escape, they were about abandoning further investigation, when the idea struck them that some clue might be obtained by going into the lot on the opposite side of the street, when a large hole was soon discovered in the corner of <num value="1">one</num> of the stalls of a shed which had been used as a stable, and on a line with the street running between it and the <rs type="place">Libby prison</rs>.--This discovery fully satisfied them that they had found out the means by which the escape had been made, and their next step was to trace out the spot where the tunnelling was commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>Some few yards from the eastern end of the building, in the basement it was found that a large piece of granite, about <measure n="3feet" type="distance">three feet</measure> by <num value="2">two</num>, had been removed from the foundation and a tunnel extending <measure n="59feet" type="distance">fifty-nine feet</measure> across the street, eastward, into a vacant lot formerly known as <persName n="Carr,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00077" reg="mostcommon:Carr,nomatch:0"><surname>Carr</surname></persName>'s warehouse, out through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>This tunnel was about <measure n="7feet" type="distance">seven feet</measure> from the surface of the street, and from <num value="2.5">two and a half</num> to <measure n="3feet" type="distance">three feet</measure> square.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>The lot in which the excavation emptied is several feet below the street, and the fleecing prisoners when they emerged from the tunnel found themselves on level ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>Running on <address><street n="Cary street">Cary street</street></address> is a brick building, through the centre of which is a large arch, with a wooden gate to permit egress and ingress to and from the lot. By this route they got into <address><street n="Canal street">Canal street</street></address>, and keeping close to the caves of the building they succeeded in eluding the vigilance of the sentinels on duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>The prisoners are confined in the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> story of the <rs type="place">Libby prison</rs>, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and basement stories had to be attained before the mouth of the tunnel could be reached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>From the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> floor leading to the basement there was formerly a stairway, but since the building has been in use as a prison the aperture at the head of the steps has been closed with very heavy planks. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/> By some means the prisoners would cut through both these floors when they wished to gain the cellar, and after they had passed down would close up the holes with the planks which had been taken out so neatly that it could not be discovered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>The cellar covers the whole area of the building and is only used as a place for storing away meal, &#x0026;c., for the use of the prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>It being very large only the front part was required, and therefore the back part of it, which is considerably below <address><street n="Cary street">Cary street</street></address>, is scarcely ever visited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>The dirt which accumulated as the work progressed was spread about this part of the basement and then covered over with a large quantity of straw which has been deposited therein.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>It is not known how long the operatives in this stupendous undertaking have been engaged; but, when the limited facilities which they possessed is taken into consideration, there can be no doubt that months have elapsed since the work was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>The whole thing was skillfully managed and bears the impress of master minds and indomitable perseverance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/> Sometime since a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <rs type="role2">Captain</rs> was found in the cellar, and on being taken before <persName n="Turner,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00078" reg="mostcommon:Turner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Turner</surname></persName>, all smeared up with meal, he gave as his excuse for being there that he did not get enough to eat and was looking for something to make bread with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>This was doubtless a falsehood, and his only business was to assist in the work which they had in hand. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/> There seems to be no doubt that further escape through this avenue was contemplated, and the earnestness with which the prisoners who remained behind tried to throw the blame upon the guard was only done to prevent further inquiry into the matter, and thereby leave the tunnel open for others to pass through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>Probably <num value="1">one</num> more night might have emptied the prison of the whole number confined therein. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/> Yesterday workmen were engaged in stopping up the passage which had been made from the prison, and it may now safely be relied on that no other prisoners will ever take their departure from the <name>Libby</name> against the knowledge and consent of the officers in charge. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/> As soon as the facts of the escape became fully known, orders were received by <persName n="Brown,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00079" reg="mostcommon:Brown,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>, commanding the cavalry battalion for local defence, that a detachment of his force should immediately scour the surrounding country in pursuit of them, and accordingly <num value="25">twenty-five</num> men from each company soon started off for that purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/><num value="4">Four</num> of the prisoners who succeeded in getting out were, late in the afternoon, recaptured and brought back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>They had gotten about <measure n="22miles" type="distance">22 miles</measure> from the city before they were overtaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>It is hardly probable, from the steps which have been taken to prevent it, that many of them will succeed in reaching the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> lines. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/> The alacrity with which the <num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num> Class Militia of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> responds to every call upon them for local defence reflects great credit upon the patriotism and courage of our city &mdash; a city which has for <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> been assailed by a powerful and vindictive foe, and has proved itself equal to every emergency in that long period of trial and endurance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>The militia of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> may now be considered a militia only in name.--In discipline and all soldierly qualities it may be thoroughly relied upon, and there never was an hour, disciplined or undisciplined, when it was not a match for any equal number of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> that could be brought against it. Individually, it is composed of men of high spirit, accustomed to the use of firearms from their youth, and educated to regard the preservation of personal honor as a more important thing than security from personal danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>It is composed of precisely the same materials as that army whose comparatively untrained courage rolled back the <rs>Northern</rs> host at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> and drove back the flower of the <orgName type="mil" key="USRegular">U. S. regulars</orgName>, taking their cannon from them, and driving them in disgrace from the field.--People who sneer at this local force, contemptuously calling them &#x0022;milish,&#x0022; do not know what they are talking about.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>It is true that many of them are of an age which renders them unfit for a regular campaign, but for the defence of their homes, which they are called upon to fight in sight of, they may be relied upon to the last drop of their blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>We venture to predict that, if ever a conflict does occur, in which the mettle of the defenders of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> is to be tried, they will fight as well as any troops who have ever been called into the field, and win new renown for Southern heroism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>If the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> expect to find in them the article commonly known as &#x0022;militia&#x0022; in the <rs>North</rs>, they have only to make the experiment, and they will learn the difference to their cost. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/> The success of the <rs>Richmond</rs> organization indicates clearly to the <rs>Government</rs> the most efficient mode of local defence and of security against sudden inroads of the enemy.--Men outside the conscript age are often capable of temporary duty of this character, whilst unable to endure the hardships of a regular campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>To put them in the army would be to sign their death warrant from exposure and disease; leave them where they are, and they are useful to the industry of the country, and indispensable to local defence. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/> In the long and bloody war in which your country is engaged, you have achieved many noble triumphs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>You have won glorious victories over vastly more numerous hosts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>You have cheerfully come privations and toll to which you were unused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>You have readily submitted to restraints upon your individual will, that the citizen might better perform his duty to the <rs>State</rs> as a soldier.--To all these you have lately added another triumph, the noblest of human conquests &mdash; a victory over yourselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/> As the time drew near when you who <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> entered the service might well have been expected to claim relief from your arduous labors and restoration to the endearments of home, you have heeded only the call of your suffering county.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>Again you come to tender your service for the public defence &mdash; a free offering which only such patriotism as yours could make &mdash; a triumph worthy of you and of the cause to which you are devoted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/> I would in vain attempt adequately to express the emotions with which I received the testimonials of confidence and regard which you have recently addressed to me. To some of those <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> received, separate acknowledgments were returned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>But it is now apparent that a like generous enthusiasm pervades the whole army, and that the only exception to such magnanimous tender will be of those who, having originally entered for the war, cannot display anew their zeal in the public service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>It is, therefore, deemed appropriate, and it is hoped, will be equally acceptable, to make a general acknowledgment, instead of successive special responses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>Would that it were possible to render my thanks to you in person, and in the name of our common country, as well as in my own, while pressing the hand of each war worn veteran, to recognize his title to our love, gratitude, and admiration. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/> Soldiers! By your will (for you and the people are but <num value="1">one</num>) I have been placed in a position which debars me from sharing your dangers, your sufferings, and your privations in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>With pride and affection my heart has accompanied you in every march; with solicitude it has sought to minister to your every want; with exultation it has marked your every heroic achievement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>Yet, never in the toilsome march, nor in the weary watch, nor in the desperate assault, have you rendered a service so decisive in results as in this last display of the highest qualities of devotion and self-sacrifice which can adorn the character of the warrior- patriot. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/> Already the pulse of the who's people beats in unison with yours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>Already they compare your spontaneous and unanimous offer of your lives, for the defence of your country, with the halting and reluctant service of the mercenaries who are purchased by the enemy at the price of higher bounties than have hitherto been known in war. Adulated by this contrast, they exhibit cheerful confidence and more resolute bearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>Even the murmurs of the weak and timid, who shrink from the trials which make stronger and firmer your noble natures, are shamed into silence by the spectacle which you present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>Your brave battle cry will ring loud and clear through the land of the enemy, as well as our own; will silence the vainglorious boastings of their corrupt partisans and their pensioned press; and will do justice to the calumny by which they seek to persuade a deluded people that you are ready to purchase dishonorable safety by degrading submission. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/> Soldiers! The coming spring campaign will open under auspices well calculated to sustain your hopes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>Your resolution needed nothing to fortify it. With ranks replenished under the influence of your example and by the aid of your representatives, who give earnest of their purpose to add, by legislation, largely to your strength, you may welcome the invader with a confidence justified by the memory of past victories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>On the other hand, debt, taxation, repetition of heavy drafts, dissensions, occasioned by the strife for power, by the pursuit of the spoils of office, by the thirst for the plunder of the public treasury; and above all, the consciousness of a bad cause, must tell with fearful force upon the over strained energies of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>His campaign in <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct>, must from the exhaustion of his resources both in men and money, be far less formidable than those of the last <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>, when unimpaired means were used with boundless prodigality, and with results which are suggested by the mention of the glorious names of <placeName reg="Shiloh, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101495">Shiloh</placeName> and <placeName reg="Perryville, Westmoreland, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2576569">Perrysville</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Murfreesboro, Rutherford, Tennessee" key="tgn,7014175">Murfreesboro</placeName>' and <placeName reg="Chickamauga, Walker, Georgia" key="tgn,7013598">Chickamauga</placeName>, and the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, and <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/> Soldiers! Assured success awaits us in our holy struggle for liberty and independence, and for the preservation of all that renders life desirable to honorable men. When that success shall be reached to you, your country's hope and pride, under <name n="God" type="God">Divine Providence</name>, will it be due. The fruits of that success will not be reaped by you alone; but your children, and your children's children in long generations to come, will enjoy blessings derived from you that will preserve your memory ever living in their hearts. </p>
