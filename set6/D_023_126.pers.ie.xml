<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>Their reason for this exasperation is that the <rs>Alabama</rs> was built in this country, and the guns with which she is mounted were also bought in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>We have no doubt of these facts, although we have no special information as to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/> Expectations which are excited only to be disappointed are better calculated to dispirit the strongest minds than the sternest realities unrelieved by a ray of hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> politicians have contrived from the beginning alternately to elevate find depress the <rs>Southern</rs> mind, by affecting to dread foreign intervention for the <rs>South</rs>, an idea which has been dispelled by every wind from the <rs>East</rs> almost as soon as it was raised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>We have steadily endeavored to put the community on their guard against this delusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>In the beginning, it was reasonable to suppose that <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and especially <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, having such manifest and powerful interests in the division of the old Union, would interpose in our behalf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>But from the moment that the <rs>Queen</rs> and Parliament distinctly announced their position of neutrality, we have felt satisfied that the <rs>South</rs> had nothing to hope from that quarter, and every official development since has been <unclear></unclear> as to strengthen that conviction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>That the <unclear></unclear> of the <rs>British</rs> people are with us is not more evident than that the policy of their Government is neither to favor the <rs>North</rs> nor the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/><unclear></unclear> the declaration of the <rs>British</rs> <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of State">Secretary of State</rs> that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> will not recognize us till we are <unclear></unclear> by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, or till the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> are too much exhausted to carry on the war, a declaration which the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> says expresses the conclusions of the <rs>British Cabinet</rs>, we are not likely to hear much of Intervention even from those who have been harping upon it till the very word has become disgusting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>We trust that henceforth every Southern patriot will steal his soul against an absurd, unmanly and suicidal delusion of looking for help to any earthly power save our own resolute hearts and strong arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>We would have the very word Intervention expunged from the <rs>Southern</rs> dictionary, and the bare thought dismissed from the mind as a guilty and shameful thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>We are able to establish our own independence, and no independence, obtained in any other way, would be woth having.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>As for those Governments which stand aloof from us in our hour of trial, after having by their intrigues brought about the present state of things, we leave them to reap the fruits hereafter of their sinister and inhuman counsels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>If we succeed, they can expect no special favors at our hands; if we fall, we shall fall with honor, but our fall will sound the death knell of their own power upon this continent, and perhaps their stability at home. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/> The ignominious manner in which the <orgName n="U. S.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>The very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> intimation which <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and <placeName reg="Espana" key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName> have given of their determination to have redress for wrongs committed upon their citizens by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> authorities has proved enough to bring the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs> to its knees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>It is only against us, whom they regard as weak and unable to cope with them, that they display an unyielding and ferocious temper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>Can anything be more cowardly and disgraceful?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>But they seem to have no shame left, and no regard for national character and honor, nor for any other consideration except vengeance upon the <rs>South</rs>. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/> We are often made to feel sadly oppressed when reading the obituary of some dear, departed friend; but in attempting to announce the death of <q>&#x0022;little Grattie,&#x0022;</q> <persName n="Maupin,IsFather,Albert,A.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00102" reg="default:Maupin,Albert,A.,,"><roleName n="IsFather">son of</roleName> <foreName>Albert</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Maupin</surname></persName>, who died at Mountain View, <placeName reg="Albemarle, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002137">Albemarle county, Va.</placeName>, on the <date value="09-30"> 30th of September,</date> we feel that no language can portray the deep feelings of anguish that now fall crushingly on the hearts of his many surviving friends; nor, indeed, can mortal tongue give utterance to words that could possibly do justice in proclaiming the merits of this good boy. His departure from time to eternity seems not only to cast a gloom over the hearts of fondly-attached parents, brothers, and sisters, together with many endeared relatives, but an aspect of general gloom seems depicted on the countenance of all who mingled in his society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>He was loved and respected by all who knew him. Why <num value="1">one</num> so loved, so kind, gentle, and pure, so directly necessary to the happiness of many, and so well qualified to reflect sunshine along the gloomy pathway of all within his influence, should be so suddenly called away, can only be known to Him who <q>&#x0022;worketh all things after the counsel of his own will,&#x0022;</q> before which it is our duty to bow in humble submission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>Indeed, he lives, and will continue to live, in the hearts of all; but especially will he be cherished by his sad and stricken family, who are now mourning his unexpected but, <unclear></unclear> final absence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>And ought not their consciousness of the pure and spotless life he lived, and the triumphant death he died, tend much to lessen the poignancy of their grief and deep despair?
