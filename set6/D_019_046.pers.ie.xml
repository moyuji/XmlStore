<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/> The <orgName n="Charleston Mercury" type="newspaper">Charleston Mercury</orgName> is known as an able and influential journal, and as far as we have noticed, is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to enter its protest against the <rs>Provisional Constitution</rs> of the new Government, and in assuming this responsibility it would seem that prudence has given place to passion, and that judgment has been superceded by an inordinate disposition for public notoriety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>We presume that at least <num value="9">nine</num>-<num value=".1">tenths</num> of the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> endorse the action of our Congress, and would, if permitted to do so, sanction with their votes the <rs>Constitution</rs> which they have adopted, as a permanent as well as a Provisional Constitution; and in opposing its most important provisions, we apprehend the <rs>Mercury</rs> will have the honor of standing alone in its glory. </p> </q><bibl n="Montgomery Post,"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/> We do not insist, however, that any individual is under obligations to approve any particular policy because others do; on the contrary, we admire an independent thinker, and a will that dares to act for itself, though the whole world oppose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>But this opposition, to entitle it to respectful consideration, must be based upon principle and dictated by reason, neither of which we think is expressed in the factious opposition of the <rs>Mercury</rs> to the new Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>So far as the <name>Tariff</name> is concerned, after adopting the policy of <hi rend="italics">ad valorem</hi> taxation as a basis, of course the imposition of duties upon imported articles will be regulated from time to time as circumstances may dictate and necessity require.--This is a matter of no material consequence at present, since it is subject to future regulation; but it does appear that he who urges the policy of leaving the slavery question, or any important department of it, an open political question, and making it <q>&#x0022;a proper subject of legislation,&#x0022;</q> has learned but little from the past political history of the country upon this subject. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/> The grand mistake under the old Government was in leaving the slavery question an open political issue, and not incorporating it as an express constitutional provision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>Political questions can never be settled; they are all the while subject to agitation, and are thus made the food upon which political demagogues feast, and the substance upon which they exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>The leaving of the slavery question as it existed under the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, <q> &#x0022;a proper subject of legislation.&#x0022;</q> has served to build up and break down parties, to distract and divide churches, to disturb the public peace, to de throne political virtue, demoralize the <orgName n="National Legislature" type="legislature">National Legislature</orgName>, corrupt every department of the <rs>Government</rs>, stimulate rebellion, engender fanaticism, incite aggression, and finally subvert the great fundamental principles upon which our institutions were based. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/> And is this the policy that the <rs>Mercury</rs> desires to inaugurate into the new Government, by leaving the exciting subject of the <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> Slave Trade an open political issue and a proper subject of legislation?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>Already has this subject been made the source of political controversy, and if left an open question, parties will be organized upon it, ambitions and designing demagogues will use it as a hobby upon which to ride into power, and through their instrumentality it will become a vital issue, and be made the political test of fidelity to the <rs>South</rs> and her institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>But to leave the principle entirely out of the question, the great mass of the <rs>Southern</rs> people, as well as all others, are adverse to the policy of reopening the <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> Slave Trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>Consequently, we think the <rs>Congress</rs> has acted prudent and wisely in thrusting it from the political arena and incorporating it in the organic law, and those who do not desire to inaugurate the exciting scenes of the past will appreciate their wisdom in this matter. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/> <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs> and Gentlemen &mdash; I am rather an old man to avail myself of such excuses as I am now about to do; yet the truth is so distinct, and pressing so directly upon me, that I cannot well avoid it &mdash; and that is, that I did not understand when I was brought into this room that I was brought in to make a speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>It was not told so. It was not intimated to me that I was to be brought into a room where <placeName reg="Daniel Webster">Daniel Webster</placeName> and <persName n="Clay,,Henry,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00222" reg="default:Clay,Henry,,,"><foreName>Henry</foreName> <surname>Clay</surname></persName> had made speeches, when in my position I might be expected to do something like these men, or do something unworthy of myself or my audience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>I therefore will beg you to make very great allowance for the circumstances in which I have been by surprise brought before you now. I have been very much in the habit of speaking, and speaking sometimes upon the political questions that have for some years agitated the country, and if I were disposed to do so, and we could take up some of the issues &mdash; as the lawyers call them &mdash; some <num value="1">one</num> of the peculiar questions in dispute, and I were called upon to make an argument upon it, why, to the best of my ability, I could do it without much preparation; but that is not what you desire to have done here to- night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>I have been occupying a position, since the <name>Presidential</name> election, of silence &mdash; of avoiding public speaking, and of avoiding public writing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>I have been doing so not because.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>I thought, upon full consideration, that that was the course for me to take,--[Great applause.] I am brought before you now and am required to make a speech when you all approve more than anything the fact that I have been keeping silence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>[Laughter and loud applause.] And now, it seems to me, the response you gave to that sentiment ought to justify me in closing just here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>[Renewed laughter.] I have not kept silent about the <name>Presidential</name> election for any party wantonness, or from any indifference to the anxieties that pervade the minds of men about the aspects of political affairs in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>I have kept silence for the reason that I supposed it was peculiarly proper that I should do so, until the time should come when, according to the custom of the country, I should speak officially.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>[Applause.] I hear some gentlemen say, <q>&#x0022;according to the customs of the country.&#x0022;</q> I allude to the customs of the <rs>President</rs> at the time of taking the oath of office; that is what I mean when I speak of the custom of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>I had supposed that when the political drama, being enacted before the country at this time &mdash; which is rapidly shifting its scenes, preventing us from anticipating with any degree of certainty today what we shall see to-morrow &mdash; that it was peculiarly fitting that I should see it all up to the very last minute; that I should take no ground, so that with the shifting of scenes I could also shift.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>[Moderate laughter.]--I have said several times on my journey that when the time does come [applause]--that when it does come &mdash; I shall then take a ground which I think is right &mdash; a ground that I shall think right for the <rs>North</rs>, the <rs>South</rs>, the <rs>East</rs>, and the <rs>West</rs>--for the whole country, [&#x0022;Good,&#x0022; and cheers;] and in saying so I hope to feel no necessity pressing upon me to say anything in conflict with the <rs>Constitution</rs>, or in conflict with the perpetuity and Union of these States, [cheers,] or in conflict with the perpetuity of the liberties of the people, or anything in conflict with anything whatever that I have ever given you reason to expect from me. [Cheers.] And now, my friends, have not I said enough?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>I think I have.--[Laughter, cries of &#x0022;no,&#x0022; &#x0022;go on,&#x0022; &#x0022;<num value="3">three</num> cheers for <persName n="Lincoln,,Abe,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00223" reg="default:Lincoln,Abe,,,"><foreName>Abe</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>,&#x0022; which were given.] Well, now, my friends, there is a difference of opinion between you and me.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/> We doubt whether there is a school in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, from the highest to the lowest, which does not use the works of <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> authors in the instruction of children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>We have lately seen a large volume in use in some of the principal seminaries and a small <num value="1">one</num> in use in primary schools, both of which ignored the founders of the <rs>South</rs>, and exalted to the <name>Heavens</name> the persecuting <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritans</rs>, representing them as flying to this country for freedom of conscience-- a worn-out fabrication, which the most brazen-faced falsifier ought to be ashamed to repeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>We observe that the <name>Legislature</name> of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> has appointed a committee with reference to the examination of school books manufactured in the <rs>North</rs> for Southern use, and the expurgation from them of abolitionism and other things offensive to truth, justice, and decency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>We should like to see this admirable measure adopted by our own Legislature and that of every Southern State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>Most of the histories and other school books produced at the <rs>North</rs> are more or less tainted with insidious assaults upon the institutions and history of the <rs>Southern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>It is far more important to the <rs>South</rs> that the education of her children should be Southern than that the legislation of Congress should be sound.--The South can protect itself against Congress, but not against the latent and subtle poison which is instilled through Northern school books into the minds of its children at school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>No doubt <num value="1">one</num> reason of the strong preference which some Southern mon give the <rs>North</rs> over their own country, is the prejudices which they unconsciously imbibed in childhood from the books they used at school.--Neither the <rs type="document">Bible</rs>, nature, nor common sense, requires any man or any people to love their neighbors better than themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>We may and ought to do full justice to the good qualities of a large mass of the <rs>Northern</rs> people, most of whom, with the exception of the depraved <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> element, are equal to any other people, but it becomes us to see that we be true to ourselves as well as to others, and this we can never be whilst our children are daily taught the moral and intellectual superiority of other States, and the evil character and injurious effects of their own institutions.
