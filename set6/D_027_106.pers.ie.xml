<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>In other words, that they should be selected and then impressed accordingly as their working qualities and adaptation to army service, together with their intrinsic value, would warrant a judicious purchaser in considering them as coming within the contemplation of the <rs>Commissioners</rs> when they assessed the average value of such horses as the <rs>Government</rs> needed as <measure n="800dollars" type="currency">eight hundred dollars</measure>. But cases might arise, however, when the public exigencies would be so urgent as to demand that all horses at hand should be impressed. --yet under ordinary circumstances, when family or extra blooded horses, or brood marse of <hi rend="italics">admitted high salute,</hi> are impressed, we respectfully suggest to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> to have instructions forwarded to the impressing officers to propose and allow the owners <unclear></unclear> in their stead such strong, sound and <unclear></unclear> horses or mules as <unclear></unclear> be considered and valued by competent and disinterested parties as <unclear></unclear> artillery horse or <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class wagon mules. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> the term average value per head is in contradistinction to a fixed and conform price for each horse or mule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Under this state of facts, we have re-examined and re-arranged our tariff of prices so far as we have been advised of recent impressments, proposing, in this mode, to remedy any diminution of valuation which may have resulted from the action of Congress upon the currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Therefore we assess the average value of artillery or wagon horses on mules impressed since the passage of the currency bill, of the <dateStruct value="-02-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> of <month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> last, at <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">six hundred dollars</measure>.--This award will entitle each person to receive higher compensation accordingly as each horse or mule recently impressed may be considered as being a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, or <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>-class artillery or wagon horse or mule, whether the parties appeal to our Board or not; and the impressing officers and agents should forthwith <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> call on all those persons of whom they impressed horses or mules and propose a settlement upon the foregoing basis; but allowing to each person only such prices as <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> and <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>- class artillery or wagon horses or mules may have been estimated at by the local or county appraisers, assuming our <unclear></unclear> appraisement of <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">six hundred dollars</measure> as a fair medium valuation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>This, then, would allow a maximum price of <measure n="800dollars" type="currency">eight hundred dollars</measure>, and a minimum price of <measure n="400dollars" type="currency">four hundred dollars</measure>, making <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">six hundred dollars</measure> the average price &mdash; thus allowing more for <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class horses or mules and proportionately less for the inferior as they may fall below the grade of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The county appraisement will be the guide in making these settlements, but within the limits of our maximum price of <measure n="800dollars" type="currency">eight hundred dollars</measure> and our minimum price of <measure n="400dollars" type="currency">four hundred dollars</measure>. This plan would perhaps be most satisfactory to the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>For whatever price the county appraisers agreed upon should be deemed fair within the range of our minimum price of <measure n="400dollars" type="currency">four hundred dollars</measure> and our maximum price of <measure n="800dollars" type="currency">eight hundred dollars</measure>; payment of whatever amount awarded to be made in the new issue of Treasury notes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> The impressing officers in those instances where there were no arbitrators or local appraisements for horses or mules impressed, should, in all such cases, themselves re-estimate the value of horses or mules thus impressed, and allow in each-case such additional compensation as would, within the limits of our schedule rates, appear just and proper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>But if, after this revaluation and settlement, any person should not be satisfied, the party could then appeal to our Board and have the case reconsidered. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>For some time the <rs>Northern</rs> papers have been loud in their demands for the closure of the port of <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName>, which now appears to them the rendezvous of a dozen <placeName key="tgn,7013938" n="1.000 37" reg="tallahassee, leon, florida">Tallahassee</placeName>, about to make a raid upon the ocean, and, to use their own words, &#x0022;a nest of pirates,&#x0022; ready to swoop down upon <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>Especially along the coast, where the maritime and fishing interests are at stake, and in the seaport cities of commercial importance, the people are clamorous for a speedy attack; and it is not impossible their importunities may be the means of bringing an iron-clad fleet against our forts, under the redoubtable <rs>Farragut</rs> or <rs>Porter</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>Current report, however, points out this place as the destination of the iron-clad fleet now assembling; and, until it can be definitely determined, we must make preparations to meet it. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/> The position of the <rs type="place">Cape Fear</rs> defences render them strong against an attack by sea, owing chiefly to their proximity to the channel through which vessels must pass to enter the month of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>It is about <measure n="30miles" type="distance">thirty miles</measure> from the town of <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName> to the sea, the river navigable for large steamers, running through a level marshy country, well wooded on either shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>Some <measure n="8miles" type="distance">eight miles</measure> below the town is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> bar, and beyond this the stream is clear and deep until the &#x0022;<persName><foreName>Rip</foreName></persName>&#x0022; is reached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>At this place there is the same change constantly going on &mdash; the channel moving about from place to place, and the &#x0022;<persName><foreName>Rip</foreName></persName>&#x0022; filling in or deepening with astonishing rapidity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>At the <rs>Eastern</rs> bar the channel runs within <num value="50">fifty</num> or <measure n="60yards" type="distance">sixty yards</measure> of the shore and close under the guns of <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName> and <placeName reg="Fort Lamb">Fort Lamb</placeName>, while, at the <rs>Western</rs> bar, <placeName key="tgn,2074695" n="1.000 6" reg="fort caswell, brunswick, north carolina">Fort Caswell</placeName> guards it equally well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>Beside these main defences are several minor batteries strung along the beach, located at points that, to an engineer's eye, seemed to bear most upon the track of vessels coming into the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>There is, also, close by <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName>, and on a point of land between the &#x0022;<persName><foreName>Rip</foreName></persName>&#x0022; and the bar, a large earthwork or mound, erected by <persName n="Lamb,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00103" reg="mostcommon:Lamb,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Lamb</surname></persName>, (commander of the forts,) which mounts some powerful guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>For several months past this has been a terror to the fleet outside, and has very properly kept them at a respectful distance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>These guns have a plunging fire upon the channel from the &#x0022;<persName><foreName>Rip</foreName></persName>&#x0022; to the bar and beyond; so it will be extremely difficult for even an iron-clad to enter the harbor until these guns are silenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>Bearing upon the &#x0022;<persName><foreName>Rip</foreName></persName>&#x0022; are several recently-constructed works, mounting very effective ordnance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>Upon the <rs>Eastern</rs> &#x0022;<persName><foreName>Rip</foreName></persName>.&#x0022;and almost immediately in the middle of the channel, is the wreck of the <term type="ship">iron-clad</term> <rs type="ship">Raleigh,</rs> which was lost by a sudden change in the moving sandy bottom; for it was proven she was in the <unclear></unclear> line passed the evening previous in safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>By this it will be seen the channel is difficult, even with skillful pilots; that it is easily defensible; and that the proper defences have been erected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>These seem quite adequate, and, I am fully of opinion, able to resist any fleet the enemy can now bring against them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/> But an attack by water may not be expected alone; for the fleet will undoubtedly co-operate with some kind of land force; and we have to look also to the land side of the works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/> A cavalry officer, of high ranks and great experience, who is, moreover, <num value="1">one</num> of the most gallant soldier in the service, speaking to us of the stricture upon the cavalry service which appeared in this <unclear></unclear> last <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, assures us that we are mistaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/><unclear></unclear> <num value="1">one</num> very material point of history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>Our cavalry <unclear></unclear> frequently charged, he says, man to man, and <unclear></unclear> to horse, during this war, and always successfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>They made such a charge in <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName>, and at several other battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>In the <rs n="Battle of Gettysburg" type="battle">battle of Gettysburg</rs> particularly, <persName n="Hampton,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00153" reg="mostcommon:Hampton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hampton</surname></persName> made a number of most brilliant charges, killing <num value="4">four</num> of the enemy with his own sabre, receiving a severe cut ever the head and a bullet through the thigh, and <unclear></unclear> the enemy's horse on each occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>It was the enemy, it appears, who <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> converted their cavalry into mounted infantry, not us; and they didn't for the simple reason that they were unable to meet us in the cavalry charge, our men being by far the litter fiders, and every way superior in this kind of <unclear></unclear> although the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> horsemen have greatly <unclear></unclear> in riding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>The same officer attributes the success of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> cavalry in the <unclear></unclear> to their greatly superior numbers, they having made it an especial point to strengthen that arm of their service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>Much is to be attributed, also, doubtless, to the superior weapons with which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are now furnished, enabling them to fire with great rapidity, and from a distance so great that it is impossible to charge from it. These arms have a range of <num value="7">seven</num> or <measure n="800yards" type="distance">eight hundred yards</measure>, while cavalry, we suppose, cannot charge effectually from a greater distance than <num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/> We make this explanation, which we have no doubt is correct, in order that our cavalry, whose <unclear></unclear> we never doubted, and have never disputed, whatever we may have said and thought in regard to their actual efficiency, may be placed right before the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>If the enemy converted their horse into mounted infantry, with long-range guns, it was clearly necessary to have mounted infantry to meet them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>We do not object to mounted infantry, and have no doubt it has rendered, and will continue to render, effective service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>What we do object to, is the conversion of all troopers into that species of force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>We cannot <unclear></unclear> believe that a large proportion of our <unclear>mount </unclear> force should be cavalry of the line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>How else <unclear></unclear> we ever to follow up a beaten enemy, or to <unclear> </unclear> him from rallying and fighting again the <unclear></unclear> after a reverse!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>In all the decided victories <unclear></unclear> times, we believe, without exception, the <unclear> </unclear> be found, by those who shall look into the matter to have been rendered decisive by the employment of cavalry at the decisive moment.--<unclear></unclear> cavalry did not consist of mounted infantry, <unclear></unclear> of housemen taught to rely on the spur and the sabre. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/> We would remark, <hi rend="italics">en passant,</hi> that some biographer of the late lamented <persName n="Morgan,General,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00154" reg="default:Morgan,John,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Morgan</surname></persName> attributes to him the invention of dismounting cavalry to fluent like infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>Others attribute it to other officers of our army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>But, in point of fact, it was the invention of none of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>They were <unclear></unclear> infantry who gained the battle of <persName n="King,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00155" reg="mostcommon:King,nomatch:0"><surname>King</surname></persName>'s mountain, <measure n="83years" type="date">eighty-three years</measure> ago. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
