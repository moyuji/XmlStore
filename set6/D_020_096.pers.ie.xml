<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> We do not wish to be misunderstood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>This thing of letting everybody vote for everything is the source of all our present woes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Especially in the army must the gradations of rank be distinct and well defined, and the power of authority be supreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>We do not even advocate a very material increase of the pay of the private soldiers, for that would involve an expense which the country could not sustain, and, besides, money is to the mass of our volunteers no consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Nor would we broach any such absurd idea as reducing the pay of the <rs>Generals</rs>, the heads of the army, the men who are as important to its functions as the human head to the body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>But what we do desire is, amidst the great devotion of our women and of our soldiers, to denounce the precedent of combining civil and military offices in the same functionary, and of loading some men down with the spoils of pluralism, whilst the great mass are barely able to obtain food and raiment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> We maintain that the honor of holding a commission in an Army of Patriots, with a private's pay and barely enough more to pay the expense incident to the rank, will be reward enough to any man who is able to volunteer at all. It is honor and duty, and not the emoluments, that lead both officers and men to volunteer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Consequently, whilst it might not be expedient now to make any material reduction, it was obviously a great mistake to begin with the mercenary principle prevalent in the <rs>Northern</rs> and in foreign armies, for both our officers and privates entered the service for the good of their country, and did not ask or desire anything more than their support, and the gratitude of the present and future generations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>What shall we say then of multiplying offices and emoluments in the person of the same individual, especially in a period like this; but that it is in fatal opposition to <rs n="Republican" type="political">republican</rs> simplicity and justice, and injurious to the public service, because the same man cannot discharge with efficiency the duties of <num value="2">two</num>, <num value="3">three</num>, or <num value="4">four</num> different offices &mdash; of offices, too, which require essentially different qualifications, and even if the incumbent has time and talent enough, would require him to be in <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> different places at the same moment.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> <hi rend="italics">Editors Dispatch:</hi>--I am glad to see that a Board has been instituted to consider the subject of discharges to disabled soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>This subject I urged upon persons in authority <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> ago. <measure n="2weeks" type="date">Two weeks</measure> since I succeeded, after months trial, in getting a discharge for a soldier who had not performed a day's duty since the <date value="06-01">1st of June</date> last, (<measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure>.) The man had gone home on a <q>&#x0022;sick leave,&#x0022;</q> but overstaying his time, was actually arrested as a deserter and brought back to camp, and but for the order from the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, would have been here to day. The Government has thus in this case paid and supplied for <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure> a man who was of no sort of service, but a burden to his company, and who greatly desired a discharge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Many men, in their patriotic ardor, volunteered to serve their country in the field, who were entirely unfit for such exposure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Many may be found in my regiment who are half the time on the <q>&#x0022;sick list.&#x0022;</q>--Their whole appearance indicate to a medical man that they are not prepared to lie upon the wet ground, or stand sentinel <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> in a drenching rain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>With care and the comforts of home they might live for years in their ordinary health, useful member of society; but who, if they do not die this winter, will carry home next Spring a miserably wrecked constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>I really honor such men, and think they should be properly cared for. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> I do not think that all men who are seriously sick should be discharged, with the idea that if they recovered they be permitted to enlist again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Men in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> may think this a good idea; but I am very sure that he will not find an officer in the field who will agree with him. A middle course is better and wiser, I think.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Let the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, or the chief of the <orgName n="Medical Department" type="department">Medical Department</orgName>, issue an order requiring every surgeon in the army to examine carefully every man in each regiment whom he knows or suspects is of feeble constitution, and certify to the <name>Department</name> the nature of the disability in question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Let this be done at once, so that the <rs type="role" reg="regimental-Surgeon">regimental surgeon</rs>'s certificates can be received by the middle of next month, and the parties so discharged reach their homes by the <dateStruct value="-12-1"><day reg="1">first</day> of <month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>If this matter is attended to, <num value="1000">thousands</num> and tens of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of dollars will be saved to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, besides an amount of comfort and happiness conferred upon our deserving fellow-soldiers which it is impossible to estimate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>If this end cannot be reached in any other way, it would be better to appoint surgeons temporarily for the purpose; but this would be expensive and tedious. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> There is another matter which is giving rise to much trouble in the army, and which will tell very seriously upon the next enlistment, unless it be early attended to. I refer to the <q>&#x0022;furlough&#x0022;</q> system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Some <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> ago a system was inaugurated that acted admirably.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>It was to permit <num value="2">two</num> men to leave each company at a time, for from <num value="5">five</num> to <measure n="7days" type="date">seven days</measure>. Lots were cast, and the men awaited patiently their turn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/><orgName n="Every week" type="newspaper">Every week</orgName> <num value="2">two</num> returned, satisfied, and indeed delighted with their trip home; while <num value="2">two</num> others left, charmed with the prospect of a similar meeting with friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Thus every <num value="1">one</num> was contented and happy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>But a <rs n="General Order" type="misc">general order</rs> came that no man, <q>&#x0022;<hi rend="italics">sick</hi>&#x0022;</q> or <q>&#x0022;<hi rend="italics">well,</hi>&#x0022;</q> should leave the regiment on any account; in a word, that <hi rend="italics">no more furloughs</hi> would be granted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>The depressing effect of this order was so great, that the well men got sick, and the sick men became <hi rend="italics">ill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/></hi> There is often no cordial to a sick man so healing as the prospect of the warm greetings of a mother's well-known voice, and the tender solicitude which heams from a loving sister's eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Last week, fearing a young man, far from home and friends, who lay ill of typhoid fever, might die of sheer despondency, I was compelled to promise that which I feared I would not be able to grant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>But his exhausted energies <hi rend="italics">must be supported</hi> by every means possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>I promised him a visit to his father and mother, whom he had not seen for <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure>! His face flushed, and his eyes filled with tears as he said, <q>&#x0022;Oh, do get me a &#x0027;leave!&#x0027; I will soon be well enough to travel.&#x0022;</q> Who can describe the pictures that memory hung up in this young man's mind at the prospect of a return to his home?--What doctor can describe the currents of resolution and energy that flowed through his excited brain?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>There is more in this than has been <q>&#x0022;dreamed of.&#x0022;</q> I fear in the &#x0022;philosophy of many a wise man. To an educated young man, who has never known what the want of sympathy or the tenderest attention in sickness was, to be stretched upon the straw, with nothing but <hi rend="italics">bad</hi> water as food for days, who can tell the depressing effects of his situation, with the prospect, often in his mind, of dying amid such scenes?* But I weary you with this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>A word in conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>Let the sick be carefully examined, and when it is ascertained that the patient will probably not be fit for service for a <hi rend="italics">month,</hi> let him, if possible, be sent home at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/><num value="2" type="ordinal">2nd</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Let an order be issued that <num value="2">two</num> men of each company be permitted to leave at a time for <num value="5">5</num> or <measure n="7days" type="date">7 days</measure>--not more than <num value="2">two</num> being absent at a time &mdash; and you will at once see a different spirit in the army here and elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>I speak what I know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>By this arrangement only <num value="20">20</num> men will be absent at <num value="1">one</num> time; and surely this will not weaken a regiment of <num value="7">7</num> or <num value="800">800</num> men. My opinion is it will, in more ways than <num value="1">one</num>, strengthen it.--It will lessen the number of men sick and unfit for duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>They, like the rotten <sic>politiciaes,</sic> replied in deprecation of our ifs, our buts, and our fears that we were never encouraging, but always casting out doubts, and sermonizing as if daybreak would never come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>Well, the period of gathering the harvest of sweets has come, and now, after preparing the world to expect sugar for the taking away, it is discovered that the yield is deficient, that the tall rank, green cane, <measure n="12feet" type="distance">twelve feet</measure> from root to top, is deficient in crystallizable matter, and that the most mature and promising to the eye falls short of furnishing, in good product, <measure n="600l." type="pounds"><num value="600">six hundred</num> pounds</measure> to the acre!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>The whole crop, if a nipping frost keeps off to <dateStruct value="-12-25"><occasion>Christmas</occasion></dateStruct>, may be above the average of the last <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>--we hope it may even exceed that &mdash; but beyond that no excess can with confidence be looked for, nor can any safe guide of public opinion prudently promise more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>The evil, however, has been done, and done, too, by the planters themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>They will force the world to believe that their crop is worth only <num value="0.5">one-half</num> what it should bring them; and human folly certainly cannot be so blind as to expect in such cases not to be believed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>It only remains for the planters now to rush their sugar to the levee here, cover it with hogsheads and molasses barrels, glut the market, make everybody sick with its abundance, and thus reduce the price to that unremunerative point where it becomes a question whether they might not have saved money by turning their cattle into their case-fields, instead of grinding it at heavy expense of time, labor, and money.--The insanity which possesses planters of both sugar and cotton in these States, in this annual exultant pre-jubilation over the growing crops, when no accurate approximate estimate of probable yield can ever safely be made, is altogether inexplicable to us, unless chargeable to the national infirmity of which we have spoken, which leads us to boast whether for or against our interests, just for the fun of the thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>We believe the sugar crop now being gathered will, as we have said, be a good average <num value="1">one</num>; but we are by no means satisfied that it certainly will be so, or that the chances are in favor of a very sanguine calculation of that kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>Equally skeptical, too, are we that any surplus will remain unsold at the end of the season, or be in warehouses as uncalled for and unrequired surplus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>Those who indulge such expectations have never condescended to furnish the data on which they found their opinion; nor have we met with a reasonably specious argument as yet proving the ability of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> to produce sugar in excess of the actual requirements of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>It is true, as we have often heretofore shown, that the taste for <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> sugars is mainly in the free Western States, where the great market for them was, before the <name>Revolution</name>, found; but now the people in the planting States, having no choice, will very soon acquire a liking for them, and their price in these hard times will commend them to favor over the refined or partially refined, with the great body of consumers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>If this war continues through the <name>Presidential</name> term of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abe,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, as we very unwillingly are constrained to believe, so far as the permanent interests of the sugar grower are involved, he will be the gainer; for the taste for his product existing already in the <rs>West</rs>, and rendered more craving from deprivation, and a similar taste being created by the war in those <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> where <rs n="refined sugar" type="product">refined sugars</rs> were mainly used previously, it follows conclusively that he will have an enlarged field to supply, and a choice of markets for customers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>It will be, however, we fear, useless to tell him that he is himself the greatest enemy of his product, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> by his ridiculous exaggerations of growing crops, next by rushing mush samples, for newspaper notoriety, to market, and lastly by overdoing the trade by crowding our levees at the most unfavorable time for sale, as regards demand, season, and pecuniary facilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>His prospects of crop and price at this moment are not discouraging; at the same time he need not make a fool of himself by the indulgence of a puerile and reprehensible habit of boasting, nor by the uncommercial vice of glutting a reluctant market. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/><num value="1">One</num> morning on my return from parade, I saw, close to my tent, a very large chameleon hanging on a bush.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>I immediately secured him and provided a box for him to repose in. In the course of a few days he became quite familiar, and, having seen them before, I knew how to gain his affections, which, in the first place, was done by feeding him well, in the next place, by scratching his back with a feather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>I used to put him on my table at breakfast, and in the course of a very few minutes I have seen him devour at least <num value="50">fifty</num> flies, catching them in the most dexterous manner with his long slimy tongue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>Nor does he ever move from his position, but so sure as an unfortunate fly comes in reach, so sure is he caught, and that with the rapidity of thought. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/> In the forenoon I always gave him a large slice of bread, which he devoured, and he generally supped on as many flies as he could manage to entrap, setting at defiance the noble <rs>Hamlet</rs>'s theory of the chameleon's death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>Promises would not have suited him at all, being at the end of each day considerably more like a crammed capon than an aired chameleon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>It is not true that this animal will change color according to what he is put on; but he will change shade according as he is pleased or displeased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>His general hue is bright green, with small gold spots all over his body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>He remains in this state when he is highly pleased by being in the sun, or being fed or scratched, which he delights in. when angry, and he is very easily made so, his hue changes to a dusky green, almost black, and the gold spots are not to be seen; but I never could perceive any other color on his body but green, in a variety of shades.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>The spots enlarge very much when he is in a good humor, so much, indeed, as to give a yellow tinge to the upper part of the animal, but, in general, they are merely little yellow spots here and there on the back and sides. </p> </q> <bibl n="An officer in Africa"/> </cit> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>Dis. </hi>] It was prepared on <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>, and on Wednesday it was telegraphed simultaneously to the loyal press of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>On its appearance here yesterday, <address><street n="Wall street">Wall street</street></address> was thrown into a terrible commotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>Federal stocks went down <num value="2.5">two and a half</num> to <num value="0.03">three per cent</num>, the bears were in high glee, and the bulls uttered curses deep, if not loud, against the author.--It was urged, in condemnation of the policy of the letter, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, that there was no necessity for the fortifications recommended; and, secondly, if there was, that the best way to accomplish the object was by means of private letters to the <rs>Governors</rs>, which would not create alarm. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/> What weight there is in these objections we shall shortly see. Meantime let us inquire how is it that this letter has produced such remarkable effects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>It is because the public mind was in a feverish state, susceptible of excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>The news comes to us upon the very heels of the announcement that the <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Nashville</rs> has effected her escape through the blockading fleet at <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, and was on her way to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, having on board <persName n="Slidell,Ex-Senator,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00104" reg="mostcommon:Slidell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Ex-Senator">Ex-Senator</roleName> <surname>Slidell</surname></persName>, as Minister to <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, and <persName n="Mason,Ex-Senator,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00105" reg="mostcommon:Mason,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Ex-Senator">Ex-Senator</roleName> <surname>Mason</surname></persName>, as Minister to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, from the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>--<num value="2">two</num> wily diplomatists, well adapted for the mission on which they have been sent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/> The moral effect, indeed, of a rebel vessel of war conveying these plenipotentiaries to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, in the teeth of a <orgName n="Blockading Squadron" type="squadron">blockading squadron</orgName>, will necessarily be very great, furnishing as it does powerful evidence to demonstrate the inefficiency and consequent invalidity of the blockade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>To enhance that effort, she is probably the bearer of the news of the defeat of the <orgName n="Federal Squadron" type="squadron">Federal squadron</orgName> in the <rs>Mississippi</rs>; for the action took place on <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>The <rs>Nashville</rs> sailed the same night and could have had the news by telegraph.--But in order to make assurance doubly sure, and that the intelligence might be transmitted at the same time by the regular mails to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, so as to reach there about the same time as the <rs>Nashville</rs>, the military authorities at <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> made some excuse for sending a flag of truce to <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>, in order to have a local paper containing the dispatch of <persName n="Hollins,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00106" reg="mostcommon:Hollins,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Hollins</surname></persName> forwarded to <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, whence it found its way to New York. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/> It is worthy of remark that on the occasion of the <rs>Federal</rs> victory at <placeName key="tgn,1122755" n="1.000 10" reg="Chicamacomico, Dorchester, Maryland">Chicamacomico</placeName> the <rs>Norfolk</rs> rebels searched all passengers, and would not permit a newspaper to come North.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>But whether founded in truth or not, the report of the naval engagement at New Orleans has produced a temporary effect here and is likely to do the same in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>Connected in the public mind with this news is the announcement that, just before the sailing of the <rs>Nashville</rs>, <num value="2">two</num> members of the <orgName n="British Parliament" type="parliament">British Parliament</orgName> were in diplomatic communication with <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00107" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>And in the news by the <rs>Glasgow</rs>, which we published yesterday, it was stated that <persName n="Lindsay,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00109" reg="mostcommon:Lindsay,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lindsay</surname></persName>, M.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/> It is in consequence of these facts, and the warlike preparations of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> in sending a large naval force to our seaboard, and continual reinforcements to <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>, at the same time that our arms have as yet done little or nothing to redeem the defeat of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, but, on the contrary, have suffered further reverses in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, that the public mind became affected, and was just in a condition to be excited by the letter of <persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00110" reg="nearbymention:Seward,William,H.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>; it is under these circumstances that <persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00111" reg="nearbymention:Seward,William,H.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName> calls upon the <rs>Governors</rs> of the loyal States to take measures to fortify the <rs>Northern</rs> frontier, and every vulnerable point on our coast. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/> Now, we think this is sound advice, and that the <rs>State Governments</rs> cannot set about it a moment too soon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>In the language of <persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00112" reg="nearbymention:Seward,William,H.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>, <q>&#x0022;<num value="1">One</num> of the most obvious precautions is that our ports and harbors should be put in a condition of complete defence; for any nation may be said to voluntarily incur danger in tempestuous seasons when it fails to show that it has sheltered itself on every side from which the storm might possibly come.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/> Now, it matters not whether the advice is given in public or private.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>The only question is <sic>is</sic> it wise?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>As to the effect upon stocks, that is only temporary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>The effect of carrying out <persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00113" reg="nearbymention:Seward,William,H.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>'s idea will be permanent; and when it is accomplished it will give confidence and a sense of security.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>It is precisely the advice which we <unclear/> since gave, and for which we were called an alarmist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>But events now justify our foresight; and when men like <persName n="Bulwer,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00114" reg="mostcommon:Bulwer,nomatch:0"><surname>Bulwer</surname></persName> talk complacently of the permanent division of the <rs>Union</rs> into <name>North</name> and <name>South</name> as a fortunate event for <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and for <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, it is high time for us to look to our defences and prepare for any emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>Let every fort be put on a War footing, and let the works be manned by the local militia;--The better are we prepared, the loss likely will be the powers of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> to attack us, and it will be far easier for us to settle our quarrel with the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>But if we continue to leave our frontiers and seaports exposed, in the face of their immense naval preparations, we only court danger and invite its appearance. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>The rain of the night previous had put the roads in a navigable condition, and although the mud was deep enough to float a Mississippi flat-boat we concluded it fordable, and pushed on.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/> Hitherto nothing has been known of the important batteries that have been constructed at <placeName reg="Evansport, Defiance, Ohio" key="tgn,2079480">Evansport</placeName>, and the operations were carried on in the most secret manner.--It was known that we had in process of construction some kind of works, with the view of blockading the <rs>Potomac</rs>; but the location of them was a secret.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>The enemy got wind of the intention, and sent steam-tugs cruising up and down the shore, to examine carefully every point and headland.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>Whenever anything suspicious was seen, a few shots were fired as <q>&#x0022;feelers.&#x0022;</q> Every spot from <placeName reg="Mathias Point, King George, Virginia" key="tgn,2496456">Mathias's Point</placeName> to the <rs>Occoquon</rs>, was subjected to this test except the right <num value="1">one</num>, and it singularly enough was passed by with a glance.--But few days since a steam-tug came up and burned a boat close under the guns, and within rifle distance of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>Every day the <rs>Federal</rs> men-of-war passed close by the insignificant cluster of pines behind which our heavy guns were concealed, and steamed on, satisfied that all was right in its direction.--Batteries in other places drew attention from this, and the works were completed without molestation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/> Although the enemy are well aware of all the main facts connected with the batteries, there may be some points upon which they are not informed, and hence I shall not publish the details for their benefit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>Suffice it to say, that those already unmasked are <num value="3">three</num> in number, and are situated upon <placeName key="tgn,2659792" n="1.000 4" reg="ship point, york, virginia">Ship Point</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,2548855" n="1.000 1" reg="north point, talbot, maryland">North Point</placeName>, and upon the headland where Dumfre's bay enters the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>I may say, however, that there is a chain of batteries from Aquia <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">Creek</rs> to <placeName reg="Freestone Point, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,2340005">Freestone Point</placeName>.--They are very strongly constructed, with good protection to the men, and mount guns enough to stop entirely the passage of vessels on the river, should <persName n="Trimble,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00130" reg="mostcommon:Trimble,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Trimble</surname></persName> see fit.--They have had frequent trials during the past few days, and the fact has been clearly demonstrated, that no vessel can pass up or down the river uninjured, unless allowed to do so. The distance, in a direct line to the <rs>Maryland</rs> shore, is a mile and <num value="7">seven</num>-<num value=".1">tenths</num>, if I remember rightly, and, with a proper elevation, balls can be thrown entirely across.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>As soon as within range she was greeted with a shot, which indicated the position of the batteries, and showed where the enemy lay. Her deeks were instantly cleared for action, and her guns made ready for a fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>She drifted slowly along, with the <orgName n="Stars and Stripes" type="newspaper">Stars and Stripes</orgName> flying, and soon opened upon the shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>A brisk cannonading on both sides then commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>The man-of-war behaved most gallantly and fought each battery in turn working on slowly in her course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>It was a beautiful sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>Evidently severely injured, the <rs n="Seminole" type="nativeamerican">Seminole</rs> fought until the tide had drifted her beyond the range of the guns.--Although an enemy now, it was impossible to forget, while watching her action, the old <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> pride, that had whilom swelled the hearts of the very officers who directed the guns against her.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>It was a welcome sight to see her coming, and the men run to their posts with hearty cheers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>But the stern obligation of an oath was upon them, a true verdict to find, according to the evidence, and the same stern obligation is now on me to pronounce the judgement in accordance with the verdict.--I may, and do, sincerely commiserate your unhappy fate, but I have no power to avert it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/>These agents are known to have made their appeals to some of the more important States without success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>It is not likely, however, that they will remain content with such refusals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>Indeed, it is understood that they are industriously endeavoring to accomplish that disloyal purpose by degrees and by indirection. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/> Taking advantage of the embarrassments of agriculture, manufactures, and commerce in foreign countries, resulting from the insurrection they have inaugurated at home, they seek to involve our common country in controversies with States with which every public interest, and every interest of mankind, require that it shall remain in relations of peace, amity, and friendship. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/> I am able to state for your satisfaction that the prospect of any such disturbance is now less serious than it has been at any previous period during the course of the insurrection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>It is nevertheless necessary now, as it has hitherto been, to take every precaution that is possible to arrest the evils of a foreign war to be superinduced upon those of civil commotion which we are endeavoring to cure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/>The same disposition has been manifested in a degree eminently honorable by all the loyal States during the present insurrection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>In view of this fact, and relying upon the increase and continuance of the same disposition on the part of the loyal States, the <rs>President</rs> has directed me to invite your consideration to the subject of the improvement and perfection of the defences of the <rs>State</rs> over which you preside, and to ask you to submit the subject to the consideration of the <name>Legislature</name> when it shall have assembled.
