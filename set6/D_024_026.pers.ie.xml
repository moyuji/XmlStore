<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>My opinion is, the worst impediment on their side is want of confidences among their own men. Their army is backed and won't fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>The <unclear></unclear> indication of this took the shape of <unclear></unclear> notice in the <hi rend="italics">Globe,</hi> an evening newspaper protecting neutrality in our struggle, and <unclear></unclear> used for that reason to express official opinions, which, not without a little sharpness towards <persName n="Gladstone,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00105" reg="mostcommon:Gladstone,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gladstone</surname></persName>, drew a clear line between him and the ministry in regard to the sentiments in his speech.
