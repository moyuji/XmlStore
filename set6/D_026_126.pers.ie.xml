<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Our troops then moved on the works, which are situated on a high bluff, and consist of strong fortifications, protected in front by a deep ditch and long abattis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The attack was made upon the west front of the fort, and the negro troops, without making much resistance, ran down the bluff to the beach, where they remained during the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The white troops, however, stood their ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Just as our men charged the works the gunboats in the river opened a furious fire upon them, which was hotly seconded by musketry from the fortifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>It was immediately discovered that the enemy had thrown strong reinforcements across from Fort <rs n="Powhatan" type="nativeamerican">Powhatan</rs>, where a large force was stationed, and in this state of affairs our troops were withdrawn from the contest, with small loss in killed and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/> But little has transpired since the date of my past letter worthy of notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>The enemy has advanced up to the north bank of the <rs>North Anna</rs> and has kept up an <orgName n="Regular Artillery" type="artillery">regular artillery</orgName> fire from the hills overlooking river, for the purpose, doubtless of ascertaining the strength and direction or <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00083" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>In <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> places he has thrown a force across the river, but it is not believed that he has as yet intended to make a serious effort to force his way to the south side, his chief object being to acquire as much information as possible in regard to the <rs>Confederate</rs> position, preparatory to ulterior operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>In the course of his reconnaissance yesterday, he gained the south bank in front of <orgName n="division"><persName n="Pickett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00084" reg="mostcommon:Pickett,nomatch:0"><surname>Pickett</surname></persName>'s division</orgName>, but was soon driven back with a loss of some <measure n="40" type="prisoners">forty prisoners</measure>, including an Adjutant, and almost including a <rs type="role" reg="Brigadier-General">Brigadier General</rs>, who was saved alone by the fleetness of his horse. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/> Since it is now well known to the enemy, there can be no harm in stating that our picket line extends along the south bank of the river, and that the success with which the enemy has forced this line at more points than <num value="1">one</num> should occasion no uneasiness whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>As at <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, so at this place, our due position is on the range of bills on the south side of the river, since a position along the banks of the river would not be so good, inasmuch as it would expose our men to a plunging fire from the enemy's well served artillery on the <rs type="place">Caroline hills</rs> beyond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>Nor could any advantage we might gain be so well followed up if our lines were further advanced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>In other words, the public may rest assured that <persName n="Lee,,Gen,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00085" reg="default:Lee,Gen,,,"><foreName>Gen</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> has placed his forces exactly where they should be placed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>The Federals have eyes as well as we, and <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00086" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Gen,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> has very sharp eyes, and he and they know what is here stated just as well as we do. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/> But will <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00087" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Gen,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> attempt to cross <num value="3">three</num> rivers &mdash; the <rs>North Anna</rs>, <placeName reg="Little, Accomack, Virginia" key="tgn,1126161">Little river</placeName>, and the <rs>South Anna</rs> &mdash; and move upon <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> by this line, or will he march further around to the right and below the points of confluence of these streams, and endeavor to cross <num value="1">one</num>--the <rs>Pamunkey</rs> --at or near <placeName reg="Hanover Court-House">Hanover Court-House</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>The reconnaissances which he has made since his arrival here were undertaken, doubtless, to enable him to decide this very question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>It is reported that he moved a considerable force yesterday up the <rs>North Anna</rs> upon our left; if this be true it is not improbable that he has decided that it is better to attempt to effect the passage of a single stream than of <num value="3">three</num>, each <num value="1">one</num> of which presents a strong line of defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>A great battle may be precipitated almost any day, but there is no special reason for believing that <num value="1">one</num> will occur this week, and it may be postponed for some time longer </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/> With the exception of an irregular shelling of the woods on the southside of the river by the enemy perfect quit has prevailed to day along the lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>The weather is superb.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>We however captured some <measure n="60" type="prisoners">sixty prisoners</measure>, who say that when our men commenced giving back the enemy were already on the run, and our boys were within a very few yards of their batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>Our loss is put at about <num value="350">three hundred and fifty</num> in this engagement. </p>

<head>The Situation.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/> Our readers will find our columns this morning more than usually barren of interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>Scarcely a rumor was afloat throughout the day yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>This state of the political atmosphere may possibly represent the calm that usually precedes the storm, and may at any moment be followed by events of portentous magnitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>Certain it is, that it cannot long continue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>Whatever may be the movements of the great armies which lie within cannon sound of the city, it is impossible that a collision can be long postponed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>Until that crisis shall have arrived, our friends must arm their souls with patience, under the comfortable assurance that when the day and hour shall have come, the horrors which they bear will be sufficient to satisfy this most sanguinary appetite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>In the meantime, we feel that our cause is in the hands of a man in whom we can place the most implicit reliance. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head>The neutrality of the <rs>British Government</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/> We have frequently taken occasion to point out to our readers the true character of that neutrality in this contest which the <rs>British Government</rs> so loudly professes, and which to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, has been neither more nor less than war in disguise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>Even the disguise has been of the most flimsy character, and, at present, since the open declaration of <persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00267" reg="mostcommon:Russell,David,,,:1"><surname>Russell</surname></persName> in the <orgName n="House of Lords" type="government">House of Lords</orgName>, seems to have been laid aside altogether.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>We, at last, after a long and strange infatuation, understand our true position relative, if not to <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, at least, to the <rs>British Ministry</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>They regard our cause with decided hostility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>They are profoundly anxious that in the present struggle slavery may be overthrown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>They perfectly well know that slavery cannot be overthrown, but in the overthrow of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>In perfect consistence with this declaration, they have, from the beginning of the war, taken every opportunity that presented itself to strike us a blow, without making an open declaration of hostilities.--There can be little doubt that <persName n="Palmerston,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00268" reg="mostcommon:Palmerston,nomatch:0"><surname>Palmerston</surname></persName>, ever ready to bully weak States and bombard their capitals, and equally ready to make any concession, however mean, to States that have the power to enforce their demands, would long since have lent his assistance to &#x0022;crush the rebellion&#x0022; had he not felt that it would be trying the temper of the <rs>English</rs> nation too severely, and had it not been inconsistent with the established policy of the <rs>British Government</rs>, which compels him to let the war go on until both parties shall have become exhausted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>As he could not venture openly to take sides, he has taken care to throw all the weight of his influence against that side which he dislikes, and in favor of that which he affects.--During the war between <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> and her revolted <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Colonies, as has been pointedly stated by the <rs>London</rs> <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Index,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00269" reg="mostcommon:Index,nomatch:0"><surname>Index</surname></persName>,</hi> a large fleet of privateers was openly built, armed, and manned in the ports of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, to cruise against the merchant ships of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName>, and they succeeded so well that, for a time, they almost destroyed the <rs>Spanish</rs> trade with all parts of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>During the <rs>Texan</rs> war many ships were built, armed, and manned for <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, in New York and New Orleans, and a recruiting station was opened in the very navy-yard of <placeName reg="Gosport, Portsmouth, Virginia" key="tgn,2356973">Gosport</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>During the war of Grecian independence, the <name>Mediterranean</name> swarmed with cruisers fitted out in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, to fight against the <name>Turks</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>No attempt, so far as we know, was ever made to put an end to this practice by the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and the fact approbation which it received, ought to have deprived that Government of all right to complain of other nations in the same particular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>Yet we find the <rs>British Government</rs> active in assisting the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government to prevent so much as a schooner from being filled out in <name>British</name> ports to cruise against the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>. &#x0022;He that would have equity must do equity.&#x0022; Most assuredly he is not entitled to it who is guilty of the very offence which he charges as criminal against others. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/> We have, we say, often alluded to the character of the neutrality professed by the <rs>British Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>But there is <num value="1">one</num> aspect of the case which, although presented in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, has never been pressed here as it might have been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> have always maintained that they had a right to dissolve at their pleasure all connection with the <rs>Government</rs> of the late Union.--This right is a corollary from their quality of sovereignty as plain and as easily proved as any corollary from any geometrical proposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>From the moment, therefore, of such separation, it is plain that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, and that portion of the continent called the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> constitute <hi rend="italics"><num value="2">two</num> peoples.</hi> Yet the <rs>British Ministry</rs> have repeatedly, in the speeches from the throne, taken occasion to call this war &#x0022;the civil war now raging in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.&#x0022; By such a form of expression they take upon themselves to decide, in favor of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, the very matter which is in dispute between us; for if this be a civil war, then, unquestionably, we are rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>Is this neutrality?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>Is it not rather an open decision in favor of the <num value="1">one</num> party against the other?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>Is it not a plain and palpable interference with the internal affairs of a people with whom they profess to be on at least friendly terms? </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
