<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> A very large meeting was held in <placeName reg="Essex, England, United Kingdom" key="tgn,7008131">Essex county</placeName> Va, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>It was addressed by <persName n="Garnett,the Honorable,M.,R.,H.," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="default:Garnett,M.,R.,H.,"><roleName n="the Honorable">Hon.</roleName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Garnett</surname></persName>, the <rs>Congressional Representative</rs> of that district.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>he urged upon the meeting prompt and decided action, and the expression of such sentiments as would furnish evidence of devotion to the <orgName n="States Union" type="union">Union of the States</orgName> so long as that Union afforded ample security to the rights of the <rs>South</rs>, and to that end he advocated a <orgName n="States Convention" type="convention">Convention of the States</orgName>, in order to obtain such additional guarantees as the change in the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the country since the adoption of the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs> required.-- He recommended such a policy on the part of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> as would enable her to mediate between the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>South</rs>, should it be necessary, yet to assure the whole country that, in the event of a disruption of the <rs>Union</rs>, <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> would be with the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The following resolutions were reported and unanimously adopted: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> <hi rend="italics">Resolved.</hi> That the people of the non-slaveholding States by their recent vote for a sectional <rs type="role2">President</rs> upon sectional principles, have manifested their deep hostility to the institutions of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> and the <rs>South</rs>, aid their fixed determinations to carry that hostility into every department of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, and to exert all its patronage and influence, and the large powers they attribute to it, for the ultimate overthrow of our social organization. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/><hi rend="italics">Resolved.</hi> That this hostile feeling and purpose in the non-slaveholding States has been growing for many years, and has been shown in the votes and speeches of their statesmen, in the teaching of their public and schools, in their literature and their state legislation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/><hi rend="italics">Resolved.</hi> That in view of their present sectional majority, and of the still larger majority which a successful exclusion of the <rs>South</rs> from the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> most give, the safety and honor of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> and of the <rs>South</rs> require such additional guarantees as will give them an absolute security within the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> <hi rend="italics">Resolved.</hi> That we deem it proper that steps be taken at once to call a Convention of all the <name>States</name>, in order that such amendments of the <rs>Constitution</rs> may be adopted as will forever secure the debts of the <rs>South</rs> in the <rs>Union</rs> or in the event such security cannot be obtained, that the <rs>South</rs> may take steps to protect her own rights. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> <hi rend="italics">Resolved.</hi> That in our opinion the use of force by the <rs>Federal Government</rs> to compel any State to remain within the <rs>Union</rs>, in the present condition of the country, must inevitably lead to a revolution in which <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> will be constrained to take part with the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> <hi rend="italics"><num value="2">2</num>, Resolved.</hi> That it is <num value="1">one</num> of the leading objects of government to secure to its citizens the rights of property, and it is therefore, the duty of Congress to pass such laws as may be necessary to secures such rights to the slaveholders of the several States of this Union, in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, and where else the <rs>Federal Government</rs> has exclusive legislative control. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> <hi rend="italics"><num value="3">3</num> Resolved.</hi> That the willful and deliberate action of many of the <rs>Northern States</rs>, in defeating the provisions of the fugitive slave law by acts of legislation and by reckless mobs, cheered on by the mass of the people in their resistance to the execution of that law, presents a case of a "bargain" broken on <num value="1">one</num> side, and therefore broken on all side and the <rs>Southern States</rs> of the <rs>Union</rs>, each and are there by absolved from its obligation if it by their will, or the will of either of them, to withdraw. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> But the <rs>South</rs> has grievances of which to complain far more galling than the bare election of a <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> to the <name>Presidency</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The surrender of fugitive slaves is a constitutional obligation upon every State in the <rs>Union</rs>.--Without such a guaranty the <rs>Union</rs> would never have been formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>It cannot long survive its continued and persistent disregard by the non-slaveholding States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The violation of it, by some, commenced almost simultaneously with the abolition agitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>It has <q>&#x0022;grown with its growth and strengthened with its strength,&#x0022;</q> until now, in defiance of Federal enactments, a majority of those States have passed stringent laws to obstruct and hinder the recovery of fugitive slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>True, the cotton States have not suffered very considerably, on this score; the evil necessarily falls mainly upon the border States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>But all the slaveholding States have felt and do now keenly feel this infidelity of their Northern sisters to their plain constitutional obligation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>They have said but little, however; they have submitted to it, almost without complaint.--Amidst the almost unmixed evil which I apprehend from the election of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, I see <num value="1">one</num> good result, and that is the awakening of the <rs>South</rs> to these great grievances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> I repeat what I said in the letter alluded to: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> <q>&#x0022;As to the means a <orgName n="Southern Congress" type="congress">Southern Congress</orgName> ought to adopt to enforce these propositions, it would be presumption in me to venture a suggestion.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/> I should hope that a firm and earnest appeal by the <rs>South</rs> to the <rs>Northern States</rs> would be needed; that they would, under a sense of constitutional obligation, repeal their <q>&#x0022;personal liberty bills,&#x0022;</q> and cease to hinder the surrender of fugitive slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>I repeat, a continued and persistent disregard of our rights in this particular, by the non-slaveholding States, cannot, and ought not, to be submitted to. It is time for the <rs>South</rs> to demand exemption from the agitation of slavery, from unjustifiable interference with our domestic peace and security, from further aggressions upon our rights, and the faithful observance by the <rs>Northern States</rs> of the requirements and guarantees of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Let the business of redress be begun now and prosecuted to a final consummation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Let every effort be made and every means be exhausted to restore the <rs>Union</rs> back to what it was intended to be by its founders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>It we fall in this, which I will not anticipate, then the interest, right, peace and honor of the <rs>South</rs> will require a dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>The inducement to break any treaty into which they may be compelled to enter, will be everlastingly before their eyes, and there can be little doubt, we presume, that they will break any such treaty, whenever a convenient opportunity may offer.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>The week closes with the exhibition of a much more cheerful and hopeful feeling among the business community in relation to commercial and financial matters, than was to have been expected in the early part of it. The expansion of Bank facilities, which followed the suspension of specie payment by the various banking institutions, has in a great degree relieved the money pressure, and confidence is slowly but steadily being established again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>Financial affairs to-day are in much the same condition as they were on yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>The <rs>Banks</rs> in pursuance of the policy which was indicated when they suspended, continue to discount quite liberally, and there is in consequence comparatively little paper offering on the street, for the reason that almost anything that will go on the street at this time, will be taken by the <name>Banks</name> in the regular course of business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>The nominal rates for <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> paper on the street to-day are <num value="9">9</num>&#x0040;<num value="0.12">12 per cent.</num> per annum, but anything but strictly <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class paper is altogether unsavable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>The community here was considerably startled this morning by the announcement that the old and respectable banking-house of <persName n="Harris,,Samuel,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00282" reg="default:Harris,Samuel,,,"><foreName>Samuel</foreName> <surname>Harris</surname></persName> &#x0026; Sons had been obliged to succumb to the pressure of the times, and stop payment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>Had this event occurred previous to the <name>Bank</name> suspensions, it would doubtless have added greatly to the panic; but neither the stock nor money market has apparently been affected in any considerable degree to-day, by the failure of this house. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/> The stock operations this week have been heavy, the aggregate value of the transactions at the <name>Board</name> being about <measure n="600000dollars" type="currency">$600,000</measure>, but for nearly all the principal securities prices have fluctuated very much. </p></q> <bibl n="The Baltimore Exchange"></bibl></cit>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>There is a more cheerful feeling in <address><street n="Wall street">Wall street</street></address> to-day, resulting from the absence of fresh sensation dispatches from the <rs>South</rs>, and the liberal movement on the part of the city <rs>Banks</rs>, which are discounting with greater freedom, and thereby coming to the rescue of the merchants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>The applications for &#x0022;accommodation&#x0022; are very numerous and very urgent, but it is given out that nobody that has anything like decent security to offer has been turned away with a denial. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>The banks are doing very little, and we presume will not venture much, if at all, until it is seen what the success of the effort of the New York banks to pay specie may be, and until the political movements South assume a more pacific character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>The suspension of specie payments is taken very quietly by those to whom the banks are debtors &mdash; note holders and depositors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>The most complaint comes from debtors to the banks, who insist on further accommodations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>What may be done ultimately in their behalf, we cannot say &mdash; as yet, however, the banks, we learn, are pursuing pretty much the same policy as before suspension, except that they pay out coin only in small amounts, as the necessities of the case may seem to require for the supply of change. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/> The banks, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct>, before suspension, paid out about half a <num value="1000000">million</num> in coin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>The Farmers' and Mechanics' lost about <measure n="90000dollars" type="currency">$90,000</measure>; the <orgName n="North America Bank" type="bank">Bank of North America</orgName> <measure n="60000dollars" type="currency">$60,000</measure>; the <orgName n="Girard Bank" type="bank">Girard Bank</orgName> some <measure n="30000dollars" type="currency">$30,000</measure>, and all of them more or less, to the amount of about <num value="500000">five hundred thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>The large amount paid out by the <name>Farmers</name>' and Mechanics' was not in consequence of any greater press for specie at its counter than at the other banks, for the crowd was greater at the <orgName n="North America Bank" type="bank">Bank of North America</orgName> but because the paying teller at the former was more prompt in meeting the demand &mdash; he wasted no time in unnecessary examination and counting, as was done at some other banks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>Notwithstanding heavy payments on <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct>, the banks are still flush, as was proved yesterday at the <orgName n="Girard Bank" type="bank">Girard Bank</orgName>, by the payment in gold of a draft of the <rs>State</rs> for <measure n="70000dollars" type="currency">$70,000</measure>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1798"/> <q>&#x0022;The window is low,&#x0022;</q> the old man remarked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1799"/><q>&#x0022;Besides, it is probable that the snow has been drifted into a heap on that particular spot; perhaps we should not find it more than a couple of feet deep a few paces from the wall.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1800"/> <q>&#x0022;In that case, they will come and help us out!&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1801"/> <q>&#x0022;I hope so; but, supposing that we are to be detained here for any length of time, we must see what resources we have; when we have done that, we will consider how we can best employ them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1802"/>The day has dawned, there can be no doubt; for the hour-hand of the wooden clock points to <num value="7">seven</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1803"/>It is fortunate I did not forget to wind it up last night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1804"/>We must always be punctual with Blanchette.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1805"/> <hi rend="italics"><dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct></hi> <num value="23">23</num>.--Yesterday morning, when we discovered that we were more close prisoners than we were the day before, we were very much depressed and saddened; nevertheless, we did not forget our breakfast and the goat.--Whilst grandfather was milking her. I watched him closely, with great attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1806"/>He noticed it, and advised me to try and learn to milk, in order to replace him, in case of need.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1807"/>I made an attempt, which was clumsy and unsuccessful at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, especially as Blanchette kept wincing and shifting her ground, as if aware of my Inexperience; but I improved greatly after <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> trials. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1808"/> When we had taken stock of our provisions and utensils, we wished to know what sort of weather it was out of doors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1809"/>I went under the chimney and looked up through the only outlet which remained open in the chalet.--In a few minutes, the sun suddenly shone upon the snow which rose around the opening to a considerable height.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1810"/>I pointed out the circumstance to my grandfather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1811"/>We could exactly distinguish the thickness of the layer of snow, because the chimney does not rise outside above the roof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1812"/>In fact, there is simply a hole in the roof, the outside chimney having been blown down in a storm. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1813"/> <q>&#x0022;If we had a ladder,&#x0022;</q> my grandfather said, <q>&#x0022;you might get up and disengage a trap which your father lately fixed on the top of the chimney, to keep out cold and wet, until the outer chimney is repaired.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1814"/> <q>&#x0022;Never mind the ladder,&#x0022;</q> I replied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1815"/><q>&#x0022;I saw in the stable a long fir-pole, and that is all I want.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1816"/>I have often climbed up trees no thicker than that, and the pole has still its bark on, which makes it easier to mount.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1817"/> I set to work, tying a string to my waistband, to haul up a shovel after I got to the top. I managed so well with feet and hands, and by pressing against the walls of the chimney as the <name>Savoyards</name> do, that I reached the roof.--With the shovel, I cleared away an open space and found that there was about <measure n="3feet" type="distance">three feet</measure> of snow on the roof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1818"/>Around the chalet it appeared to me that there was a great deal more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1819"/>In fact, the wind had swept it up into a heap; nevertheless, there must have fallen an enormous mass of snow in a very short space of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1820"/>Everything round about the chalet is hidden under a thick white carpet; the forest of fir-trees, which surrounds it in the direction of the valley, and which shuts in the prospect, is white like the rest, with the exception of the trunks, which appear all black.--Many trees are crushed by the weight; I saw large branches, and even stems, that were broken into fragments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1821"/>At that moment, there blew a strong and bitter cold wind from the north; the dark clouds which it drove before it opened at intervals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1822"/>Gleams of sunshine flashed through the openings, and ran over the field of snow with the swiftness of an arrow. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1823"/> The cold began to lay hold of me. When I tried to describe to my grandfather what I saw, he heard that my teeth chattered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1824"/>He told me to make haste and clear the trap, and as far as I could reach around the aperture of the chimney.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1825"/>It took some time, and was hard work; but it warmed me. Following my grandfather's directions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1826"/>I passed the string I had brought through a pulley, in such a way that, by pulling from below, the trap would open, while its own weight would cause it to shut.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1827"/>When we had rehearsed this little man of use <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> times, to see that it worked properly, I descended more easily than I had mounted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1828"/> My clothes were all wet, and I had no others to put on. We lighted a bright fire of twigs and <unclear></unclear>, and then lowering the trap and leaving no more than the necessary space for the smoke to escape, we spent the greater part of the day by the chimney corner, with no other light than that from the hearth; for our stock of oil was very small, and we clearly saw that we must not expect to quit our prison so soon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1829"/>We did not light our lamp till it was time to milk the goat. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1830"/> We find it a very unaccustomed and melancholy life, to have to drag through a whole day in this dull manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1831"/>Still I think that the hours would be less wearisome, if we were not living in a constant state of expectation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1832"/>It always seems as if some <num value="1">one</num> were on the point of coming to rescue us. I mounted a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time upon the roof to look whether anybody had arrived; I incessantly questioned grandpa.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1833"/>He is in hope, he says, that my father reached home safely; but perhaps the roads are completely choked by the drifted snow. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1834"/> At last, after completely closing the chimney by means of the trap, we went to bed, hoping that somebody might come to our assistance to-day; but this morning we find that, for the present, the thing is almost impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1835"/>As far as we can observe, it must have snowed all night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1836"/>We had considerable difficulty in opening the trap to light our fire; I found <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two feet</measure> of fresh snow. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1837"/> <hi rend="italics"><date value="11-25">November</date> <num value="25">25</num></hi>--The snow continues to fall abundantly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1838"/>I have again had great difficulty in raising the trap.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1839"/>We think it prudent to clear the roof of a portion of the snow with which it is laden.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1840"/>It employed a great part of the day. I leave under my feet a layer of snow sufficiently thick to keep out the cold, and I throw off the rest. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1841"/> It is some amusement to escape out of my dungeon for a little while, and yet what I do see is very sad. The inequalities of the ground around us are scarcely distinguishable; the whole landscape is most forlorn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1842"/>The earth is white, the sky is black.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1843"/>I have read at school the narratives of voyages in the <rs type="place">Icy Sea</rs> and the <rs type="place">Polar regions</rs>; I fancy we must be transported there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1844"/>But since those wretched travelers, who suffered so much from cold and incurred such great dangers, have sometimes returned to their native land, I hope that we also shall see my father and our village again. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1845"/> We are not deprived of <hi rend="italics">every</hi> comfort in our sequestered habitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1846"/>We have found more hay and straw than Blanchette would consume in a whole twelvemonth for food and bedding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1847"/>If she continues to yield us milk, we have in her a valuable resource.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1848"/>But an accident might deprive us of her; and we were very glad to find, in a corner of the stable, a small stock of potatoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1849"/>We have begun to cover them with straw, to protect them from the frost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1850"/>My father had packed the wood-stack also in the stable; but there is not enough to carry us through a long winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1851"/>We did right, therefore, in thinking of closing the trap at the times when we have no urgent need of fire; as we have reason to fear that our fuel may run short, it is a good thing to be able to keep out the cold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1852"/>Fortunately, the snow, which imprisons us, also shelters us. I am surprised that we feel the cold so little, buried up as we are. <q>&#x0022;That is why,&#x0022;</q> my grandfather observed, <q>&#x0022;the young wheat gets through the winter so well.&#x0022;</q> We will do the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1853"/>We will lie snug and close all the winter, and in spring we will put our heads out of the window.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1854"/>But what a wearisome time we have to get through till then, and <name n="God" type="God">God</name> grant that that may be all we have to suffer! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1855"/> To make up for the wood, we have a heap of firewood, which I partly collected myself, to burn at the village.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1856"/>It is a mere chance they were not taken there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1857"/>And in short, if we are driven to it, we shall not hesitate to burn the hay-racks and the mangers in the stable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1858"/>When it becomes a question of life and death, we must not look too closely at trifles; we shall be acting like the navigators who cast their cargoes into the sea. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1859"/> Our people had already in part unfurnished the chalet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1860"/>What we regret the least, is the great caldron for making cheese.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1861"/>They have left us a few necessary kitchen utensils; and, besides, a hatchet all jagged at the edges, and a saw which will hardly cut. We have each of us a pocket-knife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1862"/>Although our housekeeping articles are very incomplete, we shall manage to get on with these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1863"/>We much more regret the provision; ours are but scanty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1864"/>What a pity we could only find <num value="3">three</num> loaves, of the sort which are kept for a whole year in the mountain, and which are obliged at last to be chopped up with a hatchet!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1865"/>We also found plenty of salt, a small quantity of <rs n="ground coffee" type="product">ground coffee</rs>, <num value="5">five</num> bottles of old white wine, a little oil, and a small stock of pork lard. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1866"/> We have only <num value="1">one</num> bed, but we sleep at our case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1867"/>According to our mountain custom, it is big enough to hold <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6">six</num> persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1868"/>It stands in the corner of our only living-room, which is also the kitchen and the cheese factory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1869"/>Only <num value="1">one</num> blanket has been left us; If it is not enough, we must make use of hay and straw.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1870"/><q>&#x0022;I only wish,&#x0022;</q> I said, <q>&#x0022;that I could do as the marmots do go to sleep and remain torpid until the return of spring.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1872"/>I know that my father never went up to the chalet without taking with him a Bible and several religious books, which he read to his workmen on <date value="--7">Sundays</date>, to supply in some degree the public service which they attend in the village.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1873"/>But, apparently, he had sent his little library away. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1874"/> We much regretted, in our solitary prison, not having this means of sustaining and consoling ourselves during our long watches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1875"/>Today, having noticed, behind the old oak wardrobe, a plunk which somebody had stuck there out of the way. I pulled it out, thinking that it might serve some useful purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1876"/>With it there fell down an old dusty book which must have been lost and forgotten for several years, It was a Bible. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1878"/>In spite of that, I cannot get over my surprise at my father's not coming to our assistance, nor can I help expressing it. Hither to, my grandfather has not allowed me to perceive his uneasiness; our conversation to-day has shown that he is not less alarmed than myself. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1879"/><q>&#x0022;In fact,&#x0022;</q> I said, <q>&#x0022;this immense fall of snow did not come all at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1880"/>On the <dateStruct value="--1"><day reg="2">first</day></dateStruct>, the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, and even the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> day of our captivity, they might, <num value="1">one</num> would think, have cleared a path up to the chalet.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1881"/><q>&#x0022;I am certain,&#x0022;</q> said my grandfather, <q>&#x0022;that <persName><foreName>Francois</foreName></persName> has done all he could; but perhaps he could not get our friends and neighbors to share his fears, and it was out of his power to rescue us without assistance.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1882"/><q>&#x0022;Do you believe that, if it had been possible to fetch us away, they would have left us here, at the risk of finding us dead in the spring?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1883"/>Can they be less humane than the persons of whom we read in the newspapers, who make the greatest exertions, often at the peril of their lives, to save some unfortunate fellow-creature who is buried in a mine, in digging a well, or under a vault which has fallen in?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1884"/><q>&#x0022;I grant, my dear <persName><foreName>Louis</foreName></persName>, that our position is very sad; but, after all, they know that we are under shelter, and have some provisions.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1885"/>We went on for some time in this strain.--When my grandfather was silent, I took his hands in mine, and said: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1886"/><q>&#x0022;Hide nothing from me, I entreat you. Tell me, are you not quite as uneasy as I am?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1887"/>Speak frankly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1888"/>I am able to bow with resignation to the will of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>; I therefore deserve your confidence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1889"/>Acquaint me with your suppositions, and do not let me torment myself with my own alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1890"/>I had rather look misfortune full in the face, and know what you really think&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1891"/><q>&#x0022;Well, my poor boy, I cannot deny that I fear some accident has happened to your father.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1892"/>Now it has come to this, I had better tell you so at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1893"/>But, in short, I hardly know what to think of it; because, in default of him, other persons ought to have borne us in mind. &#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1894"/>At this, I could not restrain my fears and sobs no longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1895"/>My grandfather allowed me to give way to my grief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1896"/>The fire went out as we sat before it. We remained there in the dark, till it was quite late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1897"/>My grandfather kept <num value="1">one</num> of my hands in his, pressing it from time to time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1898"/><q>&#x0022;I have told you my fears,&#x0022;</q> he said; at last; <q>&#x0022;but do not forget that I still have hopes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1899"/>We cannot tell what unforeseen cause may have prevented their coming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1900"/>All may yet turn out well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1901"/>Put you trust in <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1902"/><hi rend="italics"><dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct></hi> <num value="1">1</num>.--I cannot conquer the terror which seizes me as I write this date.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1903"/>If some of the <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> days appeared so long and wearisome, what will they be this month.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1904"/>At least it would be bearable if we were sure this were the last of our captivity!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1905"/>But I no longer dare fix any term to it. The snow is heaped up to such a height that it looks as if it would take the whole summer long to melt it. It is now on a level with the roof; and if I did not get up every day to clear the chimney, we should soon be unable to open the trap or to light a fire. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1906"/>It vexes me that my grandfather cannot sometimes step out of this confined vault into the open air. I asked him this morning what he longed for the most, and he said, <q>&#x0022;A ray of sunshine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1907"/>Nevertheless,&#x0022;</q> he added, <q>&#x0022;our lot is much less wretched than that of very many prisoners, a number of whom have not deserved imprisonment any more than we have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1908"/>We enjoy a certain amount of liberty in our seclusion, and we find subjects of amusement which are not attainable inside the <num value="4">four</num> walls of a dungeon; we are not visited every day by a suspicious or cruel or even an indifferent jailer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1909"/>The evils which we suffer from the hand of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> have never the bitterness of those which we believe we may attribute to the injustice of men; and lastly my boy, we are not in solitary confinement; and, if your presence here causes me to feel regret for your sake, which I make no attempt to conceal, it also sustains me, and is almost necessary to my existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1910"/>I do not think you are very dissatisfied with your companion; everything about us, even up to Blanchette, is some alleviation to our captivity, and I assure you it is not merely for her milk's sake that I feel attached to her.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1911"/>These last words set me thinking, and I proposed to let the poor creature live more in our company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1912"/><q>&#x0022;She is uncomfortable all alone in the stable,&#x0022;</q> I said; <q>&#x0022; she bleats frequently, and that may do her harm, and us also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1913"/>What is there to hinder us from letting her have a corner here?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1914"/>There is plenty of room for all of us. She will be much obliged to us for the honor we do her.&#x0022;</q> I nailed a little manger against the wall, in the corner where she would be the least in our way, fixing it firmly with a couple of stakes; and, without further delay, introduced Blanchette into our sitting room. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1934"/>We heard a frightful roaring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1935"/>When we tried to open the door a jar, the chalet was filled with a whirlwind of snow; the wind rushed in with such fury that we had great difficulty in closing the door again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1936"/>We were obliged to drop the trap of the chimney; and, besides, it was impossible to light a fire, because the smoke was continually driven down again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1937"/>We ate our milk without boiling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1951"/>We then heard hundreds of feet pattering on the crisp snow overhead; we heard a rush of animals, a fierce struggle above us, mingled with horrid cries that made my blood run cold. </p> 
<p>
