The enemy, frantic to discover some weak point in our harness, may well interpret the high prices of articles essential to life as evidences of an inability to produce our own supplies, which will prove a most powerful ally of his arms; whereas, in point of fact, the land is teeming with plenty, and the high prices are the results of causes which have nothing to do with the capacity of production.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/> What effect more examples ought to have in settling a question, unless the examples shall be proved to have wrought beneficially, we are at a loss to understand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>We knew very well, before we ever saw this extract, that assizes of bread were common enough in many <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> cities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>They are among the many crying evils that have descended to the present generation from medi&#x00E6;val times, and which the present generation is extirpating as fast as it can. That we speak nothing more or less than the truth, let the following extract from <persName n="McCulloch,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00178" reg="mostcommon:McCulloch,nomatch:0"><surname>McCulloch</surname></persName>'s <hi rend="italics">Commercial Dictionary</hi>--a work justly held in high esteem by statesmen as well as merchants &mdash; testify.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>It is to be found under the article &#x0022;Bread:&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/> &#x0022;<hi rend="smallcaps">Assize of Bread.</hi>--From the year <dateStruct value="1266--"><year reg="1266">1266</year></dateStruct>, in the reign of <persName><foreName>Henry</foreName> <genName n="3">III</genName></persName>., down to our own days, it has been customary to regulate the price at which bread should be sold according to the price of wheat or flour at the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>An interference of this sort was supposed to be necessary to prevent that monopoly on the part of the bakers which it was feared might otherwise take place.--But it is needless, perhaps, to say that this apprehension was of the most futile description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>The trade of a baker is <num value="1">one</num> that may be easily learned, and it requires no capital to carry it on; so that were those engaged in the business in any particular town, to attempt to force up prices to an artificial elevation, the combination would be immediately defeated by the combination of others; and even though this were not the case, the facility with which bread can be baked at home would of itself seem to nullify the efforts of any combination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>But the assize regulations were not merely useless, they were in many respects exceedingly injurious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>They rendered the price of flour a matter of comparative indifference to the baker, and they obliged the baker who used the finest flour, and made the best bread, to sell at the same rate with those who used interior flour, and whose bread was decidedly of a worse quality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>But these considerations, how obvious soever they may now appear, were for a long time entirely overlooked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>According, however, as the use of wheaten bread was extended, it was found to be impracticable to set assizes in small towns and villages, and, notwithstanding the fewness of the bakers in such places gave them greater facilities for combining together, the price of bread was almost uniformly lower in them than in places where assizes were set. In consequence partly of this circumstance, but still more of the increase of intelligence as to such matters, the practice of setting an assize was gradually relinquished in most places, and in <dateStruct value="1815--"><year reg="1815">1815</year></dateStruct> it was expressly abolished by an act of the <name>Legislature</name> (<num value="55">55</num> <persName><foreName>George</foreName> <genName n="3">III</genName></persName>., c. <num value="99">99</num>) in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> and its environs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>In other places, though the power to set an assize still subsists, it is seldom acted upon, and has fallen into comparative disuse.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/> It appears, then, that the assize of bread so far from having produced a beneficial effect in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> and <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00179" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName>, has been discarded as pernicious, and the laws upon the subject suffered to fall entirely into disuse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>What may have been the effect in <placeName key="tgn,7004474" n="1.000 3" reg="napoli,napoli,campania,italia,europe">Naples</placeName>, <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Dublin, Pulaski, Virginia" key="tgn,2111523">Dublin</placeName>, we do not know; but we do know that these are precisely the towns in Christendom which of all others are most infested by beggars. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/> Had it been proved, however, that in these particular localities the laws in question had been beneficial, it would have proved nothing with regard to the point in issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>In all the countries enumerated the currency is good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>A man knows that the sum of money which he receives for his commodities <num value="1">one</num> day will be of the same value the next day, or the next month, or the next year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>Here, the value of the currency is continually fluctuating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>A man may sell his wheat under the <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> compulsion of the proposed law to-day for a certain sum, and in a week thereafter he may find that the sum received has fallen to half the value it bore on the day he received it. Much has been said about robbing the wives and children of the soldiers by charging high prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>We are unable to understand why a man who makes wheat and corn is under a greater obligation to support this class of the community than editors of newspapers or any other persons; and if such a man be compelled under the present circumstances to take a fixed price for his commodities, he certainly runs a risk of being thus burthened. </p>
