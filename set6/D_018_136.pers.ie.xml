<head>The Press on the <name>Message</name>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>The Message is, of course, generally commented on by the press.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>We take from our exchanges brief paragraphs, which will show the general tone of comment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The Washington Constitution interprets the <name>Message</name> to mean that the <rs>Southern States</rs> may secede if they please, without fear of coercion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>It says: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> <persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> conclusively exhibits the untenableness of a position which would reduce sovereign States to the dependent standard of provinces, and would invest the <rs>Federal Government</rs> with the attributes of absolutism &mdash; inform, perhaps, recognizing Democratic principles, but in reality laying the foundations of an oligarchy or a dictatorship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The most strenuous advocate of Southern rights could not desire more explicit language than that which the <rs>President</rs> has employed; nor can any Northern man, intelligently appreciating the genius of the federal system, dispute the reasoning adduced in support of the position, or the consequences to which it inevitably leads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/><q>&#x0022;After much serious reflection,&#x0022;</q> <persName n="Bachanan,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Bachanan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bachanan</surname></persName> declares he has <q>&#x0022;arrived at the conclusion that neither to Congress nor to any other department of the <rs>Government</rs> belongs the power to coerce a State into submission which is attempting to withdraw, or has actually withdrawn, from the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.&#x0022;</q>--The inference is plain, if not indeed expressed, that, in the judgment of <persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName>, Congress cannot constitutionally confer upon the <rs>Executive</rs> power to employ military force as against States which may secede. </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The <orgName n="National Intelligencer" type="newspaper">National Intelligencer</orgName> thus explains the contradiction which the <rs>President</rs> commits in denying the right of secession and yet holding that Congress has no right to use coercion to prevent secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>In effect, <persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> asserts secession to be a constitutional wrong, and yet denies that Congress has the power to prevent the perpetration of that wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>On this the <name>Intelligencer</name> says: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> If the <rs>President</rs>'s denial that our <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName> is <q>&#x0022;a <hi rend="italics">mere voluntary </hi> association of States&#x0022;</q> may seem to any in conflict with the opinion propounded in the sequel of his argument on this topic, when he holds that Congress has no power <q>&#x0022;to make war on a <hi rend="italics">State,</hi>&#x0022;</q> onto <q>&#x0022;coerce a State into submission,&#x0022;</q> it is perhaps just to observe that this <hi rend="italics">apparent</hi> logical contradiction springs from a failure to discriminate between the action of <hi rend="italics">States</hi> and of <hi rend="italics">individuals</hi> under a government like ours.--The laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, within the sphere of their jurisdiction, are incumbent on the individual citizens of every State in the <rs>Union</rs>, and the <rs type="role" reg="Chief Magistrate">Chief Magistrate</rs> being bound <q>&#x0022;to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, &#x0022;</q> it obviously follows, as the <name>Message</name> affirms, that <q>&#x0022;from this obligation he cannot be absolved by any human authority.&#x0022;</q> If the spirit of disaffection and revolt in any State has become so rife that to resist the contumacy of individuals is to resist the entire State, it may well be said that in such a case &#x0022;coercion,&#x0022; however clear in point of &#x0022;right,&#x0022; would be little likely to prove a remedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The logic of events must doubtless be respected as well as the logic of constitutional law, but the latter is not required, for that reason, to lower its pretensions in the forum of argument. </p> </q><bibl n="The National Intelligencer"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The <orgName n="New York Tribune" type="newspaper">New York Tribune</orgName> bitterly attacks the <rs>President</rs>'s arraignment of the <rs>Northern States</rs>, but is of the opinion that what he says <q>&#x0022;of the alleged right of secession, and the inexpediency, if not impossibility of coercion, is in the main forcibly and well said. &#x0022;</q> It concludes: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> On the whole, though there is but a small portion of the <name>Message</name> as printed that we can approve, we heartily thank the <rs>President</rs> for the <num value="4">four</num> columns that, on revision, he omitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The omission of another like amount would have rendered it quite a respectable document.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>We thank him, moreover, for the similar messages that he will refrain from writing throughout the years to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>And, though we cannot commend the moral insensibility which renders him unable to see why any good citizen should detest slave-hunting in free States, we can heartily congratulate him on the fact that he is soon to be relieved from the cares of State, and we assure him that in such relief the great body of the people will heartily sympathize. </p> </q><bibl n="The New York Tribune"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> With regard to the want of constitutional authority to coerce a seceding State, the <orgName n="New York Times" type="newspaper">New York Times</orgName> says: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> It seems incredible that any man holding a high official position should put forth such an argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>It is not a question of war at all &mdash; nor is it a question between the <rs>State</rs> and the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>It is simply a question of <hi rend="italics">obedience to the laws of Congress</hi>--and the obligation rests upon the individual citizens of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>It is their duty to obey those laws, and the <rs>State</rs> has no authority to release them from such obedience, because the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>, and the laws made in pursuance thereof, are expressly declared by the <rs>Constitution</rs> itself to be the supreme law of the land, <q>&#x0022;anything in the <rs>Constitution</rs> or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding. &#x0022;</q> The Government has precisely the same power to enforce every law of Congress in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> that it has to enforce the <rs>Fugitive Slave</rs> law in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>. <persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> does not invoke the war-making powers in the <num value="1">one</num> case &mdash; why should he in the other? </p> </q><bibl n="New York Times"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The Times concludes: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The Message, in our judgment, is an incendiary document, and will tend still further to exasperate the sectional differences of the day. It backs up the most extravagant of the demands which have been made by the <rs>South</rs>, endorses their menace of disunion if those demands are not conceded &mdash; and promises the seceding States that the power of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> shall not be used for their coercion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The entire <rs>North</rs> will be made doubly indignant by this flagrant dereliction of duty on the part of the <rs>Executive</rs> of the <name>Nation</name>, while the <name>Disunionist</name> of the <rs>South</rs> will be stimulated to fresh exertions in the work of ruin upon which they have embarked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The country has to struggle through <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> more of this disgraceful imbecility and disloyalty to the <rs>Constitution</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The <orgName n="New York World" type="newspaper">New York World</orgName>, in an article generally commendatory of the <name>Message</name>, says: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> His views of the inadequacy of the alleged reasons for this formidable secession movement; of the safety and the duty of further deliberation and delay; of the restraints, favorable to conservatism, which the responsibilities of office will impose on <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, of the absurdity of secession when claimed as a constitutional right, and his construction of his own duties and powers under existing laws, are sound, and well suited to the grave exigency they are intended to meet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>But, when he proceeds to address Congress on <hi rend="italics">its</hi>duties, his recommendations seem to us a great deal better than his reasoning. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> Whether the <rs>Federal Government</rs> has power to coerce a State into submission will, at this juncture, be thought a question of no practical consequence by that part of the country (probably a great majority) who agree with the <rs>President</rs> that such a power ought not to be exerted, if the <rs>Constitution</rs> confers it. If we are not to cut this gordian knot, but to untie it; if the country is to be extricated from these difficulties, not by the strong arm, but by argument, by expostulation, by persuasion, by concession, it makes no difference whether there is thunder sleeping in the national cannon or not. Since <persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName>'s recommendations are patriotic and statesman like, we are in no mood to quarrel with that part of his reasoning from which we dissent. </p> </q><bibl n="New York World"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> In relation to the right of coercion, the <rs>Philadelphia</rs> <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> says: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> On this point we are surprised to find that he has come to views quite at variance with those of the opening of his Message.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>He believes that no power has been delegated to Congress to suppress revolution in a State; this government of so much power becomes powerless in the very crisis which tries its strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>If resistance to the laws is attempted by a State government, such resistance cannot be suppressed, because to do so would be making war on a State, in his argument; and if this position is correct, the legal ties which bind the <rs>Union</rs> are less than ropes of sand.--This part of the <name>Message</name>, if it were not extra judicial, and, therefore, of no more value than any individual's opinion, would destroy the whole force of the statements of duty which precede it; for if a President can act on principles so loose, he can destroy all law and order when he will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>We believe, however, that this part of the <name>Message</name> was prepared in a spirit of weak concession to the disunion elements of the <rs>Cabinet</rs>, and was intended to cater to the prevailing sentiment of disunion States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>We regret this error, not because we advocate coercion, or assume now to say what the duty of the <rs>General Government</rs> may be when the exigency comes, but because we deprecate the loosening of all restraints and the release of all penalties at a time when such release directly incites to the worst acts of treason to the only power which can preserve the nation in peace. </p> </q><bibl n="Philadelphia American"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The <orgName n="Philadelphia Press" type="newspaper">Philadelphia Press</orgName> says that the <rs>President</rs> <q>&#x0022;could have offered no more grateful argument to the disunionists&#x0022;</q> than that in relation to coercion, and adds: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> &#x0022;The sum and substance of this Message, able as it is, amounts to a recommendation to the <rs>Southern States</rs>, who believe themselves to be aggrieved, to leave the <rs>Union</rs>, and an encouragement that, in the event of their doing so, there is no authority to be found, either in the <rs>Constitution</rs> or the laws under it, to </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> punish them or call them back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>We repeat that secession must end in civil war, and the sooner the public mind settles itself upon this idea the better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>A <num value="1000">thousand</num> events will precipitate a conflict between the <name>States</name> that go out and those that remain in; and it is this apprehension, daily thickening and darkening upon Congress and the country, that should induce the cotton States to pause, and rally the border States around the <rs>Union</rs>.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="Philadelphia Press"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The <orgName n="Philadelphia Bulletin" type="newspaper">Philadelphia Bulletin</orgName>, in an article attacking the <name>Message</name>, says: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> By declaring that secession is revolution, and then declaring that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have no power to put down revolution, the <rs>President</rs> puts the country in about as ridiculous a position as any poor country ever was placed in. He virtually says that our Constitution and our Union are a stupendous sham; that while we have been boasting of being a great country, with a strong government, good laws and the power to enforce them, we have no government at all; in a word, that we are a humbug among nations, and not entitled to a particle of respect from foreign powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Are the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> prepared to admit all this to be true?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Is this the sum of all that has been achieved by our revolution, by our Constitution and by our <measure n="84years" type="date">eighty-four years</measure> of existence separated from <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>? </p> </q><bibl n="Philadelphia Bulletin"></bibl></cit> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/> --We understand that a difficulty occurred on board the <rs>Mail</rs> steamer from Acquia <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">Creek</rs>, yesterday afternoon, which came near leading to a serious result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>It appears that a man from <placeName key="tgn,7007159" n="1.000 1573" reg="connecticut">Connecticut</placeName>, who has been traveling through a portion of the <rs>South</rs>, made some remarks at various times derogatory of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> and her citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>These remarks were heard by a <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginian</rs>, a resident of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, who resented them, calling the man from <placeName key="tgn,7007159" n="1.000 1573" reg="connecticut">Connecticut</placeName> a d &mdash; n liar and scoundrel, and challenging him to mortal combat in the forward part of the steamer, and offering to furnish him either a pistol or bowie-knife as a weapon.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/> The signs of the times do not improve; but, on the contrary appear to grow worse daily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>Their effect upon the people of this city is peculiarly striking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>There are hundreds of gentlemen here, who, <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> ago, were strong Union men, and some of whom talked freely about the hanging of secessionists, who are now decidedly in favor of a dissolution of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> without delay; and even the most ardent lovers of the <rs>Union</rs> are driven to the borders of despair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>The man, indeed, who has any hope of its preservation is rarely met with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>The general opinion seems to be--<num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> that a dissolution is almost beyond perad venture; <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, that it we must separate, the sooner the better for the peace of all the <name>States</name>, and for the industry and commerce of all. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/> There seems to be little disposition to speculate upon projects for saving the <rs>Union</rs>. --<placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName>'s Message is regarded as a useless document, animadverting upon the means of avoiding an event which, in a moral sense, has already occurred, and whose fulfillment, politically and physically, is progressing with as much rapidity as is possible for constitutional proceedings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>From all that we can see and hear, we can come to no other conclusion with reference to the public mind. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/> The distinguished <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> (whose letter to the editor of the <hi rend="italics">Enquirer</hi> we notice to-day,) will find that his own opinion that there is no hope left for the <rs>Union</rs>, but concurs with the general conviction, at least in this part of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/> But the nature of the event &mdash; its magnitude and moment &mdash; demand that the most powerful and astute minds of the country shall be called to devise the means of a fair and peaceable separation, if possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/><placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> has more and deeper interests at stake than any other State, and she ought to make the matter <num value="1">one</num> of serious and constant reflection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>Promptness is demanded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>If there is the remotest hope of saving the <rs>Union</rs>, then there is no time to be lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>If there is not, it is of the highest importance for our future destiny, that the step of separation shall be properly and wisely directed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>We cannot separate <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> from the <rs>South</rs>, no more than we <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginians</rs> can separate ourselves from the fate of our honored and beloved mother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>People every where should deliberate earnestly upon the position of affairs, and the leading minds of the <rs>State</rs> should study the subject with devoted attention in the brief interval of time before our State will be compelled to act her part in the <rs>National</rs> drama now transpiring. </p> </div3>

<head>The Virginia Dare &mdash; meeting of Stockholders and others.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/> A very large and agreeable party of gentlemen, composed of the stockholders and others of the new <rs>Virginia</rs> and <rs>Liverpool</rs> packet line, assembled yesterday on board the good <term type="ship">ship</term> <rs type="ship">Virginia Dare,</rs> and partook of an elegant collation which had been prepared for the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>Toasts were drunk, and patriotic, appropriate and eloquent speeches made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>We never saw a happier company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>All were delighted with the noble vessel, and proud and hopeful of the great enterprise upon which <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> has so gallantly entered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>We observed that while the festivities were in progress, the crew were busily employed in getting in the heavy hogsheads of tobacco, and other articles, amounting to much more than a cargo for <num value="1">one</num> vessel, which is ready for transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>This is a glorious beginning, and we see no reason to doubt that it will lead in time to a more glorious result &mdash; the entire commercial independence of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>Indeed, among the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> acts of the stockholders, in assembling on board yesterday, was the adoption of a resolution to build another vessel, the work upon which will be immediately commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>The enter prising and spirited resolve will be hailed with enthusiastic acclamations by the whole community, and indicates a spirit which ought to rally to its support every Southern man who has a spark of patriotism in his bosom, and who desires to show his faith by his works, and to prove his love of the <rs>South</rs> by deeds instead of words. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/> In this connection, it gives us pleasure to render tribute to the noble public spirit manifested by our enterprising fellow citizen, <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Voss,,Edward,William,,De" id="n-0001.0000.00000.00133" reg="expanded:Voss,Edward,William,,"><foreName n="Edward">Ed.</foreName> <foreName n="William">Wm.</foreName> <nameLink>De</nameLink> <surname>Voss</surname></persName>,</hi> <rs type="role">Esq.</rs>, who purchased that new and splendid bark, the &#x0022; <hi rend="italics">Pioneer,</hi>&#x0022; which has performed <num value="2">two</num> trips across the ocean, with full cargoes, and has just cleared with <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> for <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>In a ship-yard nearly opposite the place where the <rs>Virginia Dare</rs> is lying, a vessel even larger is building, also intended for the <rs>Richmond</rs> and <rs>Liverpool</rs> trade, and which will probably be the finest ship that ever graced the <rs>Virginia</rs> waters, and which is the sole property of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Voss,Mister,,,,De" id="n-0001.0000.00000.00134" reg="nearbymention:Voss,Edward,William,,De"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <nameLink>De</nameLink> <surname>Voss</surname></persName></hi> &#x0026; Co.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/> It cannot be doubted that <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Napoleon,,Louis,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00136" reg="default:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><foreName>Louis</foreName> <surname>Napoleon</surname></persName></hi> has caused <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> more anxiety and expense than any other potentate of the earth since the days of his uncle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>Let it be borne in mind that a <num value="100000000">hundred millions</num> a year is the estimated cost to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> of an actual war between <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, and that she is now compelled, in order to be prepared for such a war, to spend <num value="70000000">seventy millions</num> a year, and we may ask whether <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00137" reg="nearbymention:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName></hi> is not already having his revenge, in a quiet way, for <placeName reg="Waterloo, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2753461">Waterloo</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>It strikes us that it would be better economy to spend a <num value="100000000">hundred millions</num> in actual fighting, and take the chances of destroying the cause of this immense annual expenditure, than to let it go on from year to year, and last as long, probably, as the life of the present <rs>Emperor</rs> of the <rs>French</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>If it be true, as <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00138" reg="nearbymention:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName></hi> avers, that he has not increased the military and naval expenditures of, <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> beyond those which her ordinary establishment requires, he enjoys the singular felicity of himself escaping all the burdens of war, and heaping war expenses upon the shoulders of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, which she is compelled to carry without any of the compensating advantages of actual hostilities. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/> <num value="1">One</num> of the heaviest and most annoying sources of expenditures to which <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> is forced by her apprehensions of the <rs>French Emperor</rs>, is that which is required by the necessities of her navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>She had long been the acknowledged mistress of the <rs type="place">Channel</rs>, and at the close of the great wars with <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00139" reg="nearbymention:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName></hi> had a <num value="1000">thousand</num> ships-of-war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>So long as the era of sailing vessels continued, there was no earthly chance for <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> to dispute her naval supremacy, or to render an invasion of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/><placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> might build ships, but she could not make seamen, and Britain looked with calm contempt upon the enlargement of the <rs>French</rs> navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>But when steam was introduced in ships-of-war, and <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00140" reg="nearbymention:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName></hi> began to adopt it generally in the naval service of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, then the troubles of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> commenced, and her money began to flow like water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>Her vast sailing establishment was no longer a defence; the advantages of that immense superiority over <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> in nautical aptitude and skill which had been her glory and safeguard, were at once paralyzed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>She at once saw that steam would introduce into naval warfare the precision, certainty, and system of military movements, and that a soldier would be almost as good as a sailor to command a squadron of steamboats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>Immediately she commenced the costly work of overhauling her whole navy, converting sailing vessels into steamers, fitting them up with steam machinery, and building new and powerful steamships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>The labor and expense of the undertaking was like building an entirely new navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>But <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> never balks with either work or money when her national pride and security are concerned; and so, after an enormous expenditure, she was again in a position to overwhelm, by supremacy of numbers and metal, any attempt of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> to dispute her dominion of the sees, or to make a descent upon her &#x0022;tight little Island.&#x0022; <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Bull,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00141" reg="default:Bull,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Bull</surname></persName></hi> now felt once more at his case grumbling savagely at the cost he had been put to, but still proud of the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>Scarcely, however, had he buttoned up his pockets, when it was announced that his restless and inventive neighbor over the way, who seems to have been born for no other purpose than to keep <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Bull,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00142" reg="default:Bull,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Bull</surname></persName></hi> on the tauter hooks of anxiety, and <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> to drain his pockets of their loose change, was constructing <num value="3">three</num> terrific engines for maritime warfare, armed with iron prows and covered with steel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>There was no help for it, and <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> was compelled to build as many monsters of the same kind as <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Napoleon,,Louis,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00143" reg="default:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><foreName>Louis</foreName> <surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>,</hi> and the <rs>English</rs> press is now discussing the question whether <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> shall once more submit to an enormous increase of naval expenditure in order to rival her ambitions neighbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>The Government has apparently decided in favor of converting the naval vessels of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> from wood to iron, as the fact is announced semi-officially (in the <hi rend="italics">Army and Navy Gazette</hi>) that <q>&#x0022;the <name>Comptroller</name> of the <orgName n="Navy" type="military">Navy</orgName> is most anxious not to be behind in the race which <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> bids fair to run with us in the building of iron steamships,&#x0022;</q> and that <q>&#x0022;any apparent delay which has taken place in giving orders for the construction of a further number of formidable but most expensive ships, proceeds merely from a desire on his part to be convinced that he possesses the plans and models of vessels best calculated not only to act as engines of warfare, but as safe sea boats.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/> Another prominent <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> newspaper pronounces this the most important naval problem that has arisen since the application of steam to men-of-war; and another journal says, <q>&#x0022;We may lament a vast and possibly useless outlay, but we must not run the remotest risk of being overmatched.&#x0022;</q> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Halsted,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00144" reg="mostcommon:Halsted,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Halsted</surname></persName>, R.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>In a communication to the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName>, he says: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/> &#x0022;There is no doubt but that ships may be built which are proof against ordinary shot, but my experience leads me to believe that the penetration of armor plates is a question of firing against them a projectile under the proper combined conditions; these are, that it shall be of the proper shape, material and weight, and have the requisite velocity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>A flat-fronted projectile of properly hardened material, and weighing less than an ounce, fired from <num value="1">one</num> of my ordinary rifles, will penetrate wrought iron plates <num value="6">6</num>-10ths of an inch thick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>Again, plates <measure n="4inches" type="distance">four inches</measure> thick are penetrated by the 80lb projectiles, and I have no doubt but that the <measure n="6inch" type="distance">6-inch</measure> plates would be penetrated by heavier projectiles with a more powerful gun.--Increased thickness of plate, then, is to be overcome by increased power of gun; and the question is, in which case will the capability of increase sooner reach its limits?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>Ships which are hampered by the weight of enormous plates are so overburdened that they are unfit to carry a broadside of guns heavy enough to penetrate the armor of vessels plated similarly to themselves &mdash; Again, a ship constructed to carry very thick plates cannot be driven at the high speed which must hereafter give the superiority in naval warfare.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="The London Times"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/> It is urged, moreover, that war vessels of this description are as much exposed as any others to the effects of bombshells falling perpendicularly upon their decks; they are vulnerable through their port-holes; are liable to roll more than timber ships, from excessive top- weight; and the combination of speed with great weight of metal is a point particularly difficult of attainment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>If the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> is &#x0022;behind the age,&#x0022; in the extent of its naval force, it at least enjoys the advantages of not being compelled to undo, in any considerable measure, that which it has already done, and of being in a position to avail itself, without much inconvenience or expense, of the results of the experience and experiments of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>. </p> </div3>
