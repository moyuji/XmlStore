<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>Generally such diagrams are executed by wood cuts, and printed on ordinary presses &mdash; While in this instance the plates were all transferred to larger stones, and the impressions taken by the slow processes of the lithographers, which is very laborious, extremely expensive and requires a great deal of time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>And having used the name and the labors of the distinguished author to their own advantage, it was also due to him to have paid him the allowance, per copy published, which belonged to him. it publishers do not respect rights like these, we ask, what will hereafter on the value of a copyright in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States of America</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/> It is against the etiquette of the trade, as we understand it, to republish a non-copyright book, after it is announced that the same is in press by a member of the trade; how much more so does it violate the etiquette and the property if such a republication is done in opposition to a copyright </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/> It was hardly to have been expended from the <unclear></unclear> members of the respectable book trade in the <hi rend="italics">South</hi> that they would countenance such trespasses and we still hope that they will unite in close fraternity to protect such other and the authors from any further violation of such a right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>The proper spirit should move them to return all the spurious editions to their illegal publishers, and make known to the legitimate publishers how many they have sold of the spurious editions. </p>

<head>The people and the <rs>Militia Draft</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/> If it had been the design of the call for the militia to obtain the smallest effective force, by imposing the greatest burden upon the community, the object could not have been more fully accomplished than it is under the present call.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>In all drafts of militia that have been ever known in any country, the system of employing substitutes has been provided for, by which useful members of society, who could not leave their business without pecuniary ruin to themselves and great injury to the public, have been enabled to put better fighting men in their places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>But no such system is new provided, and efforts to obtain information from headquarters are futile. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/> There are <num value="1000">thousands</num> of men in the community who are unfit for soldiers, who are vastly more useful to their country in their places of business than they could be in the ranks, and who would each cheerfully arm and equip a good soldier for a substitute, and not only put him into a militia company for a month's service, but into a volunteer company for <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure>; thus keeping business going at home, and adding effective strength to the army; but who cannot do so, because, owing to ignorance, or incompetency, or imbecility, or indifference somewhere, no mode has been digested by which this most advantageous arrangement can be affected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>It would seem as if an irrepressible conflict of interests were raging between the <rs>Confederate</rs> and State authorities, and that those of the <rs>State</rs> were refusing to devise any means for making the call effective and convenient to the people, in the effort to make those of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> as unpopular with the country as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>Thus it would seem that the people were to be made to endure the maximum amount of suffering from this call in order that this man in office may gain some contemptible advantage over that <unclear>m</unclear> in office. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/> We have no doubt that the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> are honestly of opinion that the militia strength of the country ought to be put in a state of efficiency at this moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>We have no doubt that in pursuance of that honest opinion, they have signified the fact in the usual legal form to the <rs>State</rs> authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>We have no doubt that having done so, inasmuch as the matters of organization and of details belong exclusively to the <rs>State</rs>, they have left it to the <rs>State</rs> authorities to bring the militia into a state of efficiency in the manner provided by State laws. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/> It is precisely at this point that the burden upon the community begins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>The object of the call is to furnish effective soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>That object can be accomplished much better by devising a judicious system of regulations for the employment of substitutes than by any other process.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>The furnishing of substitutes for the militia service could be greatly improved upon, by allowing the substitute to be mustered as a <num value="12">twelve</num> month's volunteer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>The moment it was known in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, and other quarters, that soldiers could be enlisted here as substitutes and provided with arms, immense numbers of men would flock to <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> for the army, and many hundreds already here could find ready places in the volunteer companies, being provided, as they would be, with arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>The rule in regard to the minimum age of the recruit might also be modified so as to allow persons not less than <num value="17">seventeen</num> or <num value="16">sixteen</num> to substitute others on being provided with arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>Thus a very considerable army of armed and effective volunteers might be obtained by the call for the militia, provided only some pains were used in good faith by the <rs>Executive</rs> looking to the organization of soldiers, rather than to putting unnecessary burdens on the people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/> Unless some measures of this sort are taken, it is clear that the call for the militia will prove a miserable abortion, and bring disgrace, as it has already brought odium, upon the heads of its contrivers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>The people cannot be expected to do impossible things, and will not consent to take part in an affair alike absurd, ridiculous, useless, and destructive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>The mustering of militia has been a standing butt of derision for <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure>, and the popular derision and execration will be turned upon the men who would re-enact the mockery in the midst of so solemn a crisis of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>If any good could be effected by mustering an unarmed militia force, the people would encounter any mere pecuniary sacrifice or personal inconvenience, and rally to the banner of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>But when their Government calls upon them to suffer unprecedented sacrifices, in order to take part in a grand farce and wretched mockery, it asks quite too much of their patriotism, their patience and their pride.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>We expect to hear of numerous popular meetings in the counties, and the universal expression of extreme unwillingness to take part in this militia tom-foolery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>These expressions will doubtless be coupled with pledges to send more effective men into the field, on the volunteer system, than could possibly be obtained by mustering the militia. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/> The counties of the <rs>North</rs> side have responded with liberality and promptness to the call of the country for troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>They would have responded even more liberally if the volunteer spirit had not been repressed by the refusal to accept them into the service for the want of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>Now that it is understood that they will be accepted with their own arms in their hands, they will leap to the call of the country again; but it will be done with the understanding that the <rs>Government</rs> shall not violate good faith by calling forth the militia after it has stripped the country of volunteers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/><num value="1">One</num> or the other force must be left to take care of home interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>The Government must practices a little honer with the people, and not <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> beguiles them of volunteers, then rob them of all the residue of its men. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>This is especially the case with the native regiments, and there is no appearance of efficiency except where there are portions of the regular army, or else where the forces consist for the most part of the <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> element.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/> It is now perfectly well understood at the <rs>North</rs>, that impossible as it will be to raise the <num value="400000000">four hundred millions</num> of dollars demanded by <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00101" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>,</hi> it will be still more so to raise the <num value="400000">four hundred thousand</num> men which he calls for.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="878"/> Where do men usually discover the women who afterwards become their wives, is a question we have occasionally heard discussed, and the result invariably come to is worth mentioning to our young lady readers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/>Chance has much to do in the affair, and then there are important governing circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/>It is certain that few men make a selection from ball rooms, or any other place of public gaiety, and nearly as few are influenced by what may be called showing off in the streets, or by any allurements of dress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>Our conviction is, that <num value="90">ninety</num>-hundredths of all the finery which decorate or load their persons go for nothing, as far as husband catching is concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>When, and how, then, do men find their wives?
