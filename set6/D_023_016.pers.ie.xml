<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The hypocrisy of his nature, however, could not be long concealed, and, by way of illustration, we will relate an incident of his career, while palming himself off upon the <name>Georgians</name> as a man of high and holy aspirations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>On <num value="1">one</num> occasion he purchased a negro dentist, and promised him, provided he would pay him his earnings for a stipulated period, together with some <num value="0.5">fifty per cent</num>, upon the amount of the original purchase money, that he should be set at liberty and left free to act for himself afterwards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The negro being an expert in the art of tooth drawing, was elated by the prospect of eventually becoming rich and independent; and setting to work industriously, made money rapidly, and in due time fulfilled his part of the bargain.
