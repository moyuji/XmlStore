<head>The &#x0022;Situation&#x0022;--a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> raid.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>The city yesterday was in a high state of excitement, which was caused by a number of reports of a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> raid made on a scale which has heretofore been unapproached by them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>In the afternoon several <num value="1000">thousand</num> persons were congregated at the depot of the <orgName n="Richmond and Fredericksburg Railroad" type="railroad">Richmond and Fredericksburg railroad</orgName>, anxiously awaiting the news expected to arrive by the train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The train, however, was destined not to arrive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The rumors which circulated yesterday might be extended in the sensation style to several columns, but, reduced to the absolute facts of the case, may be stated as follows: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> Yesterday the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> entered <placeName reg="Columbia, Fluvanna, Virginia" key="tgn,2111293">Columbia, Fluvanna county, Va.</placeName>, and destroyed the canal banks there. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> At <time value="7oclock">7 o'clock</time> <time>yesterday</time> evening a force of Federals was within <placeName><distance reg="8miles">eight miles</distance> of <placeName key="tgn,7014170" n="1.000 62" reg="farmville, prince edward, virginia">Farmville</placeName></placeName>, with the intention of destroying the <rs type="place">High Bridge</rs>, on the <orgName n="Southside Railroad" type="railroad">Southside railroad</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> In the morning the <rs>Federals</rs> entered <placeName reg="Ashland, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2110477">Ashland</placeName> with a large force of cavalry and artillery, and, it is stated, burnt the town, which consists of a hotel and some <num value="20">twenty</num> or <num value="30">thirty</num> cottages. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> In the evening they were reported to be at a station on the <orgName n="Richmond, Fredericksburg, and Potomac Railroad" type="railroad">Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac railroad</orgName>, <measure n="8miles" type="distance">eight miles distant</measure> from the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>This report is supposed to be correct, though nothing was heard of them afterwards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>It is more likely that after the raid at <placeName reg="Ashland, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2110477">Ashland</placeName> they turned their attention to the <orgName n="Central Railroad" type="railroad">Central Railroad</orgName>, which last night at <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time> had been torn up near <persName n="Peak,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Peak,nomatch:0"><surname>Peak</surname></persName>'s, about <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure> from the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The party performing this feat is evidently on its way down the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs> to secure a safe retreat within their lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>On their way they will meet <orgName n="command"><persName n="Wise,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Wise,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName>'s command</orgName>, and may be overpowered by it and captured. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> When the raid on <placeName reg="Ashland, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2110477">Ashland</placeName> was consummated our ambulance train, with <measure n="198" type="sick">198 sick</measure> and <measure n="69" type="wounded">69 wounded</measure>, was captured, and it is stated that the cars were burnt after the prisoners were paroled. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> A gentleman who arrived here last night states that a body of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, numbering <num value="15000">15,000</num>, (an exaggeration doubtless,) were at <placeName reg="Deitrick's Store">Deitrick's Store</placeName>, in <placeName reg="Goochland, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002163">Goochland county</placeName>, yesterday, and were taking all the horses and negroes to be found in the neighborhood. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> From <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> we learn that on <name>Friday</name> we met the enemy at <placeName reg="Chancellorsville, Spotsylvania, Virginia" key="tgn,7017621">Chancellorsville, in Spotsylvania county</placeName>, defeated them and drove them back <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure>. Among the killed on our side was <persName n="Price,Major,Chauning,R.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="default:Price,Chauning,R.,,"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <foreName>Chauning</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Price</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, Aid to <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Among the wounded was <persName n="Harris,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Harris,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Harris</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="MS16">16th Mississippi</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>It was stated that yesterday there was heavy fighting along the lines; but, as the telegraph lines were down, and there was no railroad communication, of course the report is not to be relied on. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The Central train last night, at <time value="7.5oclock">7&#x00BD; o'clock</time>, brought down <measure n="59" type="prisoners">59 prisoners</measure> captured on <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The city has now troops enough within its limits to defend it from any raid of the nature above described, and enough we hope to catch the raid makers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Last night, on the public square, several regiments of citizens were formed, in accordance with the general desire to have a hand in protecting <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> against the invaders, should they attempt to come to the city. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> Your &#x0022;<placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> correspondent,&#x0022; a novice in &#x0022;war correspondence, &#x0022; is almost vexed at the inaccuracy and imperfection of rumors reaching him from the widely separated points of conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Ubiquity being impossible, and all writing useless, unless near enough to reach the cars in time, I can give you mainly reports, whose accuracy I will endeavor to sift and ascertain. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> At <num value="7.5">7&#x00BD;</num> this morning the roar of artillery from above, apparently at or behind <placeName reg="Banks's ford">Banks's ford</placeName>, was echoed from batteries on the river near <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Hamilton's Crossing</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Before going to the latter point and listening to &#x0022;the music of its roar&#x0022; on both sides of me, let me give you yesterday's news.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>I learned that the heavy cannonading yesterday afternoon occurred about <placeName><distance reg="7miles">7 miles</distance> above <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName></placeName> on the <placeName reg="Plank, Tioga, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2092056">Plank</placeName> road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>There was little fighting beyond skirmishing, the enemy keeping close in the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The results I may gather this morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The fighting <rs>Wednesday</rs> I hear was done mainly by the <num value="5" type="ordinal">5th</num> and <orgName type="regiment" key="LA6">6th Louisiana</orgName>, and the <orgName type="regiment" key="GA13">13th Georgia</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>It was <persName n="Henley,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Henley,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lt. Col.</roleName> <surname>Henley</surname></persName>, of the <num value="6" type="ordinal">6th</num>, who was taken prisoner, with <num value="87">87</num> of his regiment killed, wounded and missing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> They attacked the enemy near <placeName reg="Pratt's house">Pratt's house</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="LA5">5th Louisiana</orgName> held the river road opposite <persName n="Bernard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Bernard,nomatch:0"><surname>Bernard</surname></persName>'s. An officer told me he thought there were <num value="7000">7,000</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> on this side on the bank of the river, who are making earthworks, and had <num value="2">two</num> cannon at least across.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>On Thursday some half dozen of the <orgName type="regiment" key="LA9">9th Louisiana</orgName> were killed by the premature explosion of <num value="1">one</num> of our own shells. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> A wounded soldier who left the fight early yesterday afternoon tells me that <orgName n="division"><persName n="Anderson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><surname>Anderson</surname></persName>'s division</orgName> engaged the enemy and drove them back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>A prisoner told him only <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 1">one corps</orgName> had come over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>I hear since that <num value="4">four</num> are on this side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The enemy were easily driven back at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, but being reinforced by a division of regulars, they fought better, but were driven <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure>. <persName n="Rhodes,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Rhodes,nomatch:0"><surname>Rhodes</surname></persName>'s men reinforced <persName n="Anderson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><surname>Anderson</surname></persName>'s. It was not a general fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The woods are extensive and there is little cleared land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>It occurred near a wooden church, where the river road enters the <placeName reg="Plank, Tioga, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2092056">Plank</placeName> road, about <placeName><distance reg="7miles">seven miles</distance> above <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The enemy seem disposed to come in behind <placeName reg="Marye's hill">Marye's hill</placeName> this time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> <time value="10:5am">10&#x00BD; A.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The enemy <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> moved down the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>After the heavy fire above had continued some time, the enemy turned and moved large forces at double-quick up the river and withdrew nearly all their pickets, leaving <num value="1">one</num> only in <measure n="40yards" type="distance">40 yards</measure>. Before that they were thick and close almost as in line of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>We have been satisfied, from such imperfect information as was obtainable, that there was enough in the <rs>South</rs> to feed the army and the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>If the deficiency of transportation has been felt by the army, it has been more stringent upon the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>The Government had control of the lines of communication, and not only occupied them chiefly with its transportation, but its agents pressed for the use of the <rs>Government</rs> the supplies destined for market for the general consumer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>It ought, therefore, to occasion no surprise that the stocks have been insufficient for the demand, and that insufficiency was no good reason for inferring a great scarcity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>There is a plenty &mdash; probably not to justify a waste, which, indeed, is never justifiable, however abundant the supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>There is, beyond a doubt, enough in the land to feed all well; and, with a favorable year, there will be a superabundance of the necessaries of life in the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/> The apprehension of a scarcity has had very bad effects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>It has occasioned uneasiness and stimulated the spirit of extortion.
