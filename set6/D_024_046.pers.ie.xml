<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/> For this speech has been talked about and expected a long time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>It is known to have been elaborated with unusual care, to have been consulted <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> over, changed and re-written.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>Days, if not weeks ago as becomes known by accident, it was printed and then committed to memory from the proof slips.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>It is to be the deliberate, well-considered utterance for Southern rebels by the ablest and boldest spokesmen of their Northern allies, on the floor of the <orgName n="National Congress" type="congress">national Congress</orgName>, and in the teeth of the loyal representatives of the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>All this is known and yet there is no manifestation of other than close and respectful attention. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/> The features of our <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName> rebel, too well known at home to need description, with the usual expression of the face, the strange contortions as he speaks the unpleasantly conspicuous pieces of gold in his front teeth &mdash; painfully suggesting too close dependence on the metal that often works wondrous changes of intellectual convictions &mdash; the close cropped whiskers under the jaws as if his neck only seemed to himself to need protection, not his face &mdash; these marked, and, let us only say, not attractive features, are studied with a curious interest as he begins. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/> For this man is the hero of our Northern rebels, the most respectable in talents, the most honest in declaring his positions, the bravest in maintaining them against whatever storm of opposition and obloquy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>Dislike him as <num value="1">one</num> may, there is no denying his devilish ability, and therefore no dismissing him with contempt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/> He begins boldly, defiantly even, and is speedily prescribing the very doctrine of devils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>You can never subdue the seceded States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/><measure n="2years" type="date">Two years</measure> of fearful experience have taught you that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>Why carry on the war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>If you persist, it canonly end in final separation between the <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>.--And in that case, believe it now as you did in my former warnings, the whole Northwest will go with the <rs>South</rs>! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/> He wages more earnest as he approaches this key note of his harangues, and with an energy and force that makes every bearer, as his moral nature revolts from the bribe, acknowledge all the more the splendid force with which the tempter urged his cause, with flashing eye and livid features and extended hand, trembling with the passion of his utterance, he hurls the climax of his threatening argument again upon the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> side of the house: &#x0022;Believe me as you did not the solemn warning of years past, the day which divides the <rs>North</rs> from the <rs>South</rs>, the self-same day decrees eternal divorce between the <rs>West</rs> and the <rs>East</rs>.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/> A murmur of indignation runs through the ball, members turn to each other exchange whispers and turn back toward the speaker as he returns from the inner line of desks next the clerk's desk, where he has moved in the energy and excitement of his declaration, to his former place in the midst of the opposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/><num value="6">A half dozen</num> leading members are seen clustering around <persName n="Bingham,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00085" reg="mostcommon:Bingham,nomatch:0"><surname>Bingham</surname></persName>'s seat, on the extreme right, and asking him something.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>He shakes his head once or twice, then listens to them again, finally consents, and is noticed to begin making hasty notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>He has just been urged by leading <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> to reply to this dangerous speech on the spot &mdash; to match a hasty extempore effort against this considered compact, polished and elaborate plea for Northern treason. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/> The group of <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> standing is the open space before the clerk's desk increases they crowd down the aisles among the opposition and cluster around the speaker as he resumes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>Even the eternal chattering in the ladies' galleries has ceased, the seats are all crowded, the correspondents and reports a have been attracted, by the interest of the scene, and for a wonder the reporters' gallery is full and attentive. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/> An effort is making on the floor to get a joint session of the <name>Military</name> and Nava Committees to hear a proposition from <persName n="Field,,Cyrus,W.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00086" reg="default:Field,Cyrus,W.,,"><foreName>Cyrus</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <surname>Field</surname></persName> backed by the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, about a submarine cable to New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/><num value="1">One</num> member after another flatly refuses to obey the call of the chairman, and leave the debate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>The eminent telegrapher waits an hour in the committee room, and finally gets to see <num value="3">three</num> out of the <num value="14">fourteen</num> members.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>Such is the interest the discussion of treason's argument is arousing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/> The speaker resumed: &#x0022;There is not <num value="1">one</num> drop of rain that falls over the whole vast expanse of the <rs>Northwest</rs> that does not find its home in the besom of the gulf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>We must and will follow it, with travel and trade; not by treaty, but by right; freely, peaceably, and without restriction or tribute, under the same Government and flag!&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/> It is eloquently spoken, and none are more willing to concede it than his opponents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>And yet, forcible, polished, stirring as it is, what is it but the gospel of materialism, the ignoring of all moral considerations, the slander on the people of his home, that for the paltry sake of a little caster mode of finating their corn to market they will forsake the <rs>Union</rs> of their fathers, trample upon all the traditions of their national existence, and tie themselves as tributaries to that body of sin and death, a slave-breeding, purely slave civilization, treason-born <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/> There are many more words in the speech words boldly conceived and forcibly spoken, but that is its substance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>The Administration is censured, too often only justly, but with the eager haste of hate, not with the slow spoken condemnation to which the friends of the <rs>Government</rs> often feel forced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>The stupidities of our military management, the foolish extravagance of boasting with which a thoughtless portion of the press and an excitable people entertained upon the work of subduing the rebellion, are rightly enough exposed; but the tone of the exposure is not that which the friends of the <rs>Union</rs> and the <rs>Government</rs> would give it; it sounds like the malignant sneering of the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName>, or the devilish exultation of the <orgName n="Richmond Examiner" type="newspaper">Richmond <hi rend="italics">Examiner</hi></orgName> There is prayer for peace to descend, but it is not the prayer of the patriot, anxious that after honorable and triumphant wars that have vindicated the nation and subdued its enemies, the bloody banners be borne back and folded away; it is the prayer of the sordid shop-keeper who clambers to heaven that his craft and his profit are in danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>And there are growing promises for the future, but that future is to be &mdash; not progress to a purer civilization, but degradation to the basest out-growths of the present. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/> He has spoken over an hour and <num value="0.25">a quarter</num>, and has accomplished that rare feet compelled the closest attention of the most disorderly deliberative body in the world from the beginning to the end. He has not quite finished, but <num value="1">one</num> extension of time has already been granted him. More is refused, and he closes without peroration. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/> There is a gradual relaxation a sudden humming of conversation again on the floor and through the galleries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>The <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs> and border statesmen, with faces wreathed in smiles, crowd around their champion with their congratulations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>At a single step the shunned and execrated <persName n="Vallandigham,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00087" reg="mostcommon:Vallandigham,nomatch:0"><surname>Vallandigham</surname></persName> has risen to the leadership of their party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>Deny it, as some of them still may, henceforth it is accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>This project of cutting the dykes is to shear her completely of her strength, and she is to fall an unresisting prey to the terrible <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>This scheme, according to the <hi rend="italics">World,</hi> is certainly to succeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>It is impossible for it to fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>We have, however, seen so many <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> schemes fall, after failure had been pronounced impossible, that we place no great confidence in their infallible recipes for taking any place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>We were told that <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00140" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, having possession of <num value="2">two</num> rivers, and an enormous fleet upon them, could not fall to take <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>There is no cause, therefore, to feel any additional alarm because the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> newspapers tell us there is no possibility of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00143" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s falling to take <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/> In the meantime, the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName> is eager for another advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>That is to say, destroy all the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName> and they will be conquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>We doubt whether the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> will feel very grateful for this information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>The <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> would please them much better by telling them how all this is to be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>That <hi rend="italics">if</hi> is a great stumbling block to all the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> plans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/><hi rend="italics">If</hi> the <rs>Confederates</rs> be beaten why then they will be beaten; that is the sum total of the <hi rend="italics">Herald's</hi> logic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>So it is undoubtedly true, that if the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> will destroy the <rs>English</rs> navy, the <rs>English</rs> will no longer be the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> maritime Power in the world. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/> The prospect, we think, is highly encouraging.
