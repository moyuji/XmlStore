<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Up to that time battles had been contested with but comparative slight loss on either side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>In these engagements, however, the <rs>Federal</rs> army had not a man less than <hi rend="italics"><num value="30000">thirty thousand</num></hi> placed <hi rend="italics">hors de combat,</hi> whilst our own casualties footed up figures approximating to <num value="10000">ten thousand</num>, But this was not all &mdash; the <rs>Federal General</rs> had placed everything upon the hazard of a die; he had sworn to fight and to defeat the rebel hosts; he had planned for successful campaign, but allowed nothing for a mismarriage of his plan, or want of success in the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>Hence it was that when <persName n="Halleck,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00051" reg="mostcommon:Halleck,nomatch:0"><surname>Halleck</surname></persName> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-learned of <persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00052" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,nomatch:0"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName>'s defeat, so overwhelmed was he with disappointment that he dispatched orders to destroy the stores at Aquia <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">Creek</rs>; subsequently' however, countermanding these orders in time to prevent the destruction contemplated. </p>

<head>Taxation.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/> The revolutionary Government of '<num value="76">76</num> could not, we believe, lay taxes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>That power was reserved by the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>Of course, when they created a currency they had nothing better to make it out of than their simple promise to pay. Backed by no substantial means to redeem this promise, it is not wonderful that the currency thus created should speedily decay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>Our own <orgName n="Provisional Congress" type="congress">Provisional Congress</orgName> had greatly the advantage of that of '<num value="76">76</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>They <hi rend="italics">had</hi> the power to tax, but did not do it. They had, also, the power to purchase, at peace prices or at a very small advance upon peace prices, all the cotton in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>We have heard that they were besieged by petitions from immense numbers of planters, praying them to take their cotton at <measure n="20cents" type="currency">twenty cents</measure>; but they turned a deaf ear to the prayer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>Their proceedings were secret, and therefore we cannot know whether this was so or not. We suppose they will <num value="1">one</num> day be made public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>History has a right to know who was foremost in opposing these petitions, and what was the prevailing motive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>If any man, or set of men, opposed their reception because he hoped that the existence of the war would enhance the value of cotton and put money in his or their pockets, the fact should be transmitted to posterity for the benefit of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>It should be understood how aptself-interest is to mar schemes of the highest patriotism and the most profound wisdom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>Be all this as it may, the <rs>Congress</rs> laid no tax, and did not take the cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>It did, however, authorize the issue of an enormous number of promises to pay without providing any means of payment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>It was compared to the old Congress, and it seemed determined to make the likeness as complete as possible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/> In process of time these promises to pay have become a source of serious trouble to the country and no small vexation to Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>What is to be done with them.--Their sum total shows the figure of <measure n="700000000dollars" type="currency">$700,000,000</measure> or thereabouts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>We can learn nothing from the secret proceedings of the <rs type="place">House</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>It is rumored out of doors, however, that this sum is to be funded, and that a heavy tax is to be laid to pay the interest on it.--At the same time another heavy tax is to be laid to support the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>The tax for the payment of interest must produce at least <measure n="40000000dollars" type="currency">$40,000,000</measure>. The tax in support of Government must produce a great deal more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>The fear is that the people will become discontented under the weight of the heavy taxation necessary to obtain both these objects at the same time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>We made a proposition the other day &mdash; or perhaps it is more correct to say we suggested a plan &mdash; for obviating these difficulties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>It is to postpone the payment of the interest of the debt until after the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/> We are aware that this will be called a proposal to repudiate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>We do not regard it as such.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>On the contrary, we look upon it as a conservative proposition, intended to obviate the <hi rend="italics">necessity</hi> of repudiating at a future day. It is a mere postponement of payment, the result of a stringent necessity, which is common enough in the transactions of every day life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>Congress itself &mdash; or, if not Congress, at least the <rs>State Legislatures</rs> &mdash; have passed laws prohibiting the compulsory collection of debts during the present state of affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>Nobody complains of these laws, so far as we can understand, and they are not understood to encourage the least approach to repudiation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>Why not place the public and the private debtor on the same footing, and compel both to wait for their money until the termination of these troubles?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>Relieved from this burthen for the present, at a time when her energies are most required for the prosecution of the war, the country could put forth <num value="10">ten</num>-fold strength in the support of the <rs>Government</rs> it has chosen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>Nor do we conceive that the public faith will in the slightest degree be impugned, or the public credit called in question by the act. The people know that the <rs>Government</rs> is embarrassed &mdash; that it is carrying on a tremendous war &mdash; that it requires the earnest support of every citizen &mdash; and that if it fail, subjugation follows as a necessary consequence, when the payment of this debt will not only be postponed, but postponed indefinitely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>They will acquiesce cheerfully in the postponement, if they can thereby assist in escaping the terrible catastrophe. </p> </div3>

<head>The Pleasures of the chase.</head>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/> Lion hunting is a favorite pastime only with the boldest and most adventurous spirits, the hunting of such game as possesses not lionize qualities is more popular and universal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>There is nothing more exciting and agreeable to human nature than the chase of such animals as stand not at bay. Even the cockneys of <placeName reg="London, Madison, Ohio" key="tgn,2080432">London</placeName>, than whom a more harmless folk in general dwell not upon the globe, delight to disport themselves in the pursuit of small birds, and array themselves for that purpose in the garb of mighty Nimrode.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/> Among the most exciting amusements of this kind, not beneath the dignity even of members of Congress, (who are known to be the most dignified, intelligent, and exemplary of the human species,) is the chase of that description of bipeds known as Government clerks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>Under the old U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>Without friends, and helpless as partridges and snow-birds, they present the most tempting target that ever drew a cockney's fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>Nothing so strikingly illustrates the passion of man for sport as the eagerness to pursue animals whose flesh is not good for food and whose plumage is not attractive to the eye. The Government clerks have in general but little meat on their bones, and their raiment is by no means purple and fine linen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>We do not mean to intimate that many of them could ever have been elected members of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>With the exception of that small minority of their number which exempts itself from performing military duty, imbibes strychnine whiskey and dallies with the tiger in his jungle, there is not <num value="1">one</num> of them qualified for a national legislator.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>But scholars, authors, and men of genius, are not wanting among them, and it is pleasant to see such pulled down and degraded, their keen sensibilities lacerated, and the fangs of poverty and the world's scorn fixed in their vitals, and a whole angry pack of hounds and huntsmen yelping and yelling for their blood. </p>
