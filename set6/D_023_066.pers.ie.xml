<head>Our army in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> The intelligence which we have received, thus far, from our army in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, is meagre, unsatisfactory, and made up from <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> papers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The mortal terror of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, however, affords ample proof that the blow has been struck in the proper place, and that, if properly followed up, it will not fail to tell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>What course <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> designs to pursue; whether he will proceed immediately into <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, or advance upon the <rs type="place">Relay House</rs>, or at once march upon <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, we have, of course, no means of determining.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>To us it appears, however, that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-named enterprise would be that which a General would be most likely to undertake. </p> 
<list type="ordered"> 
<head></head> 
<item n="1"> <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The road lies most invitingly open.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>There are no regular soldiers on the route, and it would be a task of little difficulty to disperse the rabble of militia that might be brought to oppose him. </item> 
<item n="2"> <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The country is enormously rich.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>I abounds in fat cattle, cereals, horses, and mules.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Our troops would live on the very fat of the laud.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>They would find an opportunity, moreover, to teach the <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> farmers and graziers, who have been clamorous for this war, what invasion really is. If once compelled to take his own physic, which is a great deal more than he has ever bargained for, Mynheer will cry aloud for peace in a very short time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>For our own part, we trust that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> proclamation of <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Pope,John,,,:1"><surname>Pope</surname></persName>, and the manner in which his army carried it out, will not be forgotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>We hope the troops will turn the whole country into a desert, as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> did the <name>Piedmont</name> country of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Let not a blade of grass, or a stalk of corn, or a barrel of flour, or a bushel of meal, or a sack of salt, or a horse, or a cow, or a hog, or a sheep, be left wherever they move along.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Let vengeance be taken for all that has been done, until retribution itself shall stand aghast.--This is the country of the smooth-spoken, would be gentleman, <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>He has caused a loss to us, in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, of at least <num value="30000">30,000</num> negroes, the most valuable property that a <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginian</rs> can own. They have no negroes in <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Retaliation must therefore fall upon something else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>And let it fall upon everything that constitutes property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>A <rs n="Dutch" type="group">dutch</rs> farmer has no negroes; but he has horses that can be seized, grain that can be confiscated, cattle that can be killed, houses that can be burnt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>He can be taken prisoner and sent to <persName n="Libby,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Libby,nomatch:0"><surname>Libby</surname></persName>'s warehouse, as our friends in <placeName key="tgn,1002368" n="1.000 18" reg="fauquier, virginia, united states">Fauquier</placeName>, and <placeName key="tgn,7015770" n="1.000 22" reg="loudoun, virginia, united states">Loudoun</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Culpeper, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2111394">Culpeper</placeName>, and <persName n="Stafford,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Stafford,nomatch:0"><surname>Stafford</surname></persName>, and <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, and the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>, have been sent to <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s dungeons in the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Let retaliation be complete, that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> may learn that <num value="2">two</num> can play at the game they have themselves commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/></item> 
<item n="3"> <num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>By advancing into <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> with rapidity, our army can easily get possession of the <orgName n="Pennsylvania Central Railroad" type="railroad">Pennsylvania Central Railroad</orgName>, and break it down so thoroughly that it cannot be repaired in <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>. They have already possession of the <orgName n="Baltimore and Ohio Railroad" type="railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</orgName> and the <orgName n="York Railroad" type="railroad">York Railroad</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>By breaking down these and the railroad from <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> to <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, they will completely isolate both <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>No reinforcements can reach them from either the <name>North</name> or <name>West</name>, except by the <rs>Potomac</rs> and the bay. </item> </list> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> <num value="1">One</num> effect which the invasion of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> would have we have not yet alluded to, and it is the most important of any. It would compel <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> to follow <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> and to fight a battle outside of his entrenchments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> would have his own choice of ground and his own time to fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>He could lead him so far off that he could not get to his burrow.--He would inevitably rout him, and probably destroy his whole army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>It was in this way that <persName n="Hannibal,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Hannibal,nomatch:0"><surname>Hannibal</surname></persName> brought the <rs>Consul Flaminius</rs> to battle at Thrasymene, and destroyed his whole army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The <rs n="Carthaginian" type="ethnic">Carthaginian</rs> General passed through the rich district of Perugia, ravaging and burning as he went, and still directing the head of his columns towards <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The allies of <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> called aloud for assistance, and the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> General was compelled to afford it.--He followed the track of his enemy, who kept before him until he found a position in which he cold give battle with advantage, and then he halted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>By pursuing a similar course in <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> can compel <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> to pursue him and fight him on his own terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Whether such be the design of the movement into <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, we know not; but, most assuredly, there is scarcely any severity which the laws of war would not justify in retaliation for the excesses in which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> indulged while they were in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>They deliberately went to work to starve the population; their soldiers, when captured, not hesitating to avow the object they had in view. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> As yet information is so scanty that we cannot tell whether the incursion into <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> is to be supported, or whether the main object of the <rs>Confederates</rs>, at present, is to get possession of the <rs type="place">Relay House</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>That position is naturally strong, and is strongly fortified; but we presume it would offer no insurmountable obstacle to men who carried the enemy's positions by storm at Mechanicville and <placeName reg="Twymans Mill, Madison, Virginia" key="tgn,2114675">Gaines's Mill</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Once taken, and the railroad communication north of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> being cut off, that city must fall and the enemy be compelled to evacuate <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Whether the enemy would carry into execution his threat of burning <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, in the event of its falling into our hands, it is difficult to say. He is savage enough and villain enough, beyond a doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>But he knows that we have it in our power to retaliate, and it is to be hoped the authorities would not hesitate to do it.--He knows, besides, that a very large proportion of the population &mdash; among them many persons of great wealth &mdash; are friends of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Sooner than disoblige these, we are inclined to think that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> would give up the city, and trust to fortune for regaining it at some future day. The same thing may be said of <placeName reg="District of Columbia" key="tgn,7013962">Washington City</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>We cannot bring our minds to the belief that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, when compelled to evacuate it, will destroy even the public buildings, since such a measure would amount to a confession that the game was entirely up with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Nevertheless, all the public buildings are, or were, undermined. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/> When I wrote you last I did not know exactly the relative position of our forces, because, having arrived at <time value="2am">2 o'clock A.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>It turns out that the <num value="20">twenty</num> pieces of artillery of which I spoke in my formes letter, occupied the <hi rend="italics">centre</hi> and front with <orgName n="division"><persName n="Anderson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00191" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>'s division</orgName>; on our right was <persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00192" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>, and left, <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00193" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,John,W.,,:1"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>The fight was brought on by the artillery, and a few troops upon our right and left, all in sight of our batteries, and not more than <measure n="1000yards" type="distance">1,000 yards</measure> off. Of this there can be no mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>If you will read the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> accounts you will see what a different case they make of it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>We have some of these pieces in our own battalion.
