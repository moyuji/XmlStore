<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>There are, however, rumors of important movements on the part of the enemy, which, though we place little faith in them, it may be proper to notice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> In the first place, the report is renewed that the enemy has withdrawn from the <orgName n="Weldon Railroad" type="railroad">Weldon railroad</orgName>; but that &#x0022;woft-told tale&#x0022; has been so frequently exploded that we give it no consideration whatever.--Nevertheless, since the rumor gained some credence in camp, scouts were sent out to ascertain the enemy's position; but the result of their observations has not yet transpired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>We venture the prediction, however, that they found the situation unchanged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>It is true that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> derives no advantage from occupying and holding the railroad, but then he has convinced all Yankeedom that it was the most magnificent strategic movement of the campaign, and it would not be safe for his reputation to undeceive the people by abandoning his position in a hurry.--Hence, we believe that he still holds the road in force, and means to remain there &mdash; if he can. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> Another report is that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> is moving troops to the right, either with the intention of reinforcing <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName> or of making another feint on the north side of the <rs>James</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>This may be true; but the man&#x0153;uvre last named has already been repeated several times, and the attempts of the enemy to deceive our commanding general have proved as futile as his efforts to capture <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and so will they prove in the future. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> It is further reported that a raiding party has started from <orgName n="army"><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00030" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> through <placeName reg="Dinwiddie, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1002336">Dinwiddie county</placeName>, and have reached the vicinity of the <rs type="place">Court-house</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Not much confidence is placed in this report, though we need not be surprised to hear of such an enterprise being set on foot by the enemy at any time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>Some men in <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName>, who are really unable to provide a cow for their families, have been sporting revolvers since these operations began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>There is a large class of such persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>Where the money that bought the weapons which they carry came from I do not know; I only know that large sums of money have been, and still are being, provided somewhere, by somebody, to send arms and ammunition into the <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">State of Indiana</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>We can at best only imagine where the sources of this fund are. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/> I believe, however, and am as confident of the fact as I am of any other fact of which I have not positive and indubitable evidence, that this money with which these operations are, and have been carried on in <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName> has been supplied by the rebellion; either directly from the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities or by their authorized agents in New York.--For myself, I entertain no doubt upon that subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>It is utterly impossible that the large amount of money required for the purchase of these large quantities of arms and ammunition could have been raised in the ordinary way of contributions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>I happened to know something of the difficulty in the way of raising <num value="20">twenty</num>, <num value="50">fifty</num> or a <measure n="100000dollars" type="currency">hundred thousand dollars</measure> in that way. In the <placeName type="city" key="tgn,7007567">city of New York</placeName> there are hundreds and <num value="1000">thousands</num> of men who have been compelled to leave the rebel States, and who have both the means and the disposition to aid the rebellion in this way. In addition to these, there are also there a large number of resident capitalists who have sympathized with the rebellion from the very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>Their trade was in the <rs>South</rs> at the breaking out of the war; their financial interests have been in the <rs>South</rs> from the very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and they have doubtless contributed liberally towards paying the expenses of organizing and equipping the treasonable organizations in the <rs>North</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/> It is all <num value="1">one</num> thing to <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00077" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName n="Jefferson">Jeff.</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> whether we shall fall by means of a defeat at the coming elections, or by the overthrow of the <rs>Union</rs> armies in the field.--If we shall elect a candidate for the <name>Presidency</name> who is in favor of peace upon the terms of <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00078" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName n="Jefferson">Jeff.</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>, who is in favor of withdrawing our armies from the field, and recognizing the independence of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, they will gain their object just as effectually as though they should have annihilated the last of the <rs>Union</rs> armies in the field.--These men understand it. They know that their easiest, and safest, and surest, and, indeed, their only way to accomplish their infernal purposes, and secure the permanent disruption of the <rs>Union</rs> and their own independence, is to divide our people and to get the <rs>Federal Government</rs> into the hands of men who will at once concede them the victory. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>So manifest is this, that <persName n="Brough,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00081" reg="nearbymention:Brough,John,,,"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Brough</surname></persName>, of that State, has felt it his duty to issue a proclamation, dated &#x0022;<orgName n="Department of the Executive" type="government">Executive Department of <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName></orgName>, <placeName reg="Columbus, Muscogee, Georgia" key="tgn,7013643">Columbus</placeName>, <date value="08-23">August 23d,</date>&#x0022; in which he warns the people against resisting this new thinning out of their homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>The draft is to take place on <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> next, the <dateStruct value="--5"><day reg="5">5th instant</day></dateStruct>, and in some of the districts in the <rs>State</rs> there is a deficiency in the quota, and it must be put in operation in those districts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>In his proclamation he says: </p> <milestone unit="column" n="6"/> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>The exertion which has been made to discourage and prevent enlistments, if otherwise directed, would have filled the quotas of those localities, or left the deficiencies very light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>However unwilling to believe that any considerable portion of the people of this State would array themselves in a spirit of factious, if not treasonable, opposition to the execution of the laws of the land, there are indications of such a spirit in the <rs>State</rs>, which as <rs type="role" reg="Chief Magistrate">Chief Magistrate</rs>, I may not disregard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>In appealing to the people to discard the counsels of wicked and unprincipled leaders that invite them to factious and forcible resistance to the draft, or any other legal requirement of the <rs>Government</rs>, I am actuated solely by a desire to preserve, if practicable, the peace of the <rs>State</rs> and the welfare of the erring portion of our people, and not from any apprehension of either the determination or ability of the <rs>Government</rs> to maintain the supremacy of its laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>The man who supposes that either the <rs>National</rs> or State Government is unadvised of, or unprepared for, the threatened emergency, is following the deception of his leaders to consequences of the most serious character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>Let me advise you who countenance this insurrection to look carefully at the civil and military penalties you are incurring. </p> </q><bibl n="Governor Brough"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/> He then cites to them all the pains and penalties ordained by Congress to follow any resistance to the &#x0022;Government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>,&#x0022; which it is likely the people of <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName> will count as light afflictions, and but for a moment, as compared with the terrible alternative of being sent South to be killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>The following is the conclusion of his proclamation: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/> If men may take up arms to resist laws, in the policy or effect of which they do not concur, then all government is at an end, and we are resolved into anarchy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>This state of things is not to be tolerated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>A government may as well perish in a bold and vigorous effort to maintain its integrity as to suffer an insurrection to neutralize <unclear></unclear> and defy its power. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/> Most earnestly do I appeal to the people of the <rs>State</rs> not to engage in this forcible resistance to the laws to which evil counsellors and had men are leading them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>It cannot and will not succeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>Its triumph, if it achieve any, must be of a mere temporary character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>The Government is not weak; it is strong and powerful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>It cannot, and it will not, permit any armed insurrection to impeach its strength or impair its power while contending with the <rs>Southern</rs> rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>I do not say this to you in any spirit of intimidation or in any threatening tone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>I speak it to you as a warning, and with an imploring voice to hear and heed it. I know what the determination of your Government is, and I fully comprehend the power at hand to enforce it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/> What can you who contemplate armed resistance, reasonably expect to gain by such a movement? --You cannot effectually nor permanently prevent the enforcement of the laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>You cannot in any wise improve your own condition in the present, and must seriously injure it in the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>Judicious and conservative men who look to the supremacy of government for the protection and safety of their persons and property will not sympathize nor co-operate with you. You may commit crime; you may shed blood; you may destroy property; you may spread ruin and desolation over some localities of the <rs>State</rs>; you may give aid and comfort for a season to the rebels already in arms against the country; you may transfer for a brief time the horrors of war from the fields of the <rs>South</rs> to these of the <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706">State of Ohio</placeName>; you may paralyze prosperity and create consternation and alarm among our people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>This is a bare possibility; but it is all you can hope to accomplish; for you have looked upon the progress of our present struggle to little purpose if you have not learned the great recuperative power and the deep earnestness of the country in this contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>The final result will not be doubtful; the disaster to you will be complete, and the penalty will equal the enormity of the crime. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/> From the commencement of this rebellion the <placeName reg="Ohio" key="tgn,7007706">State of Ohio</placeName> has maintained a firm and inflexible position, which cannot now be abandoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>In this internal danger that now threatens us, I call upon all good citizens to assert and maintain the supremacy of the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the <name>Laws</name> of the <name>Land</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>These constitute the great elements of our strength as a nation, and they are the bulwarks of our people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>Hold in subjection, by persuasion and peaceable means, if you can, all attempts at civil insurrection or armed resistance to the laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>Failing in this, there is another duty as citizens, from which we may not shrink, and to which I earnestly hope we may not be enforced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>To those who threaten us with this evil, I say we do not use any threats in return; there is no desire to provoke passion or create further irritation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>Such men are earnestly and solemnly invoked to abandon their evil purpose; but at the same time they are warned that this invocation is not prompted by any apprehension of the weakness of the <rs>Government</rs> or the success of the attempts to destroy it. I would avert, by all proper means, the occurrence of civil war in the <rs>State</rs>; but if it must come, the consequence must be upon those who precipitate it upon us. </p> <closer> <signed><persName n="Brough,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00082" reg="default:Brough,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName>  <surname>Brough</surname></persName>.</signed> </closer> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/> It is plain that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00151" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and his gang consider the <orgName n="Chicago Convention" type="convention">Chicago Convention</orgName> an affair of serious importance from the desperate <hi rend="italics">lying</hi> with which they are endeavoring to influence its decisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>It was foreseen from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, that unless <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00152" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> could achieve some great success before the <rs>Convention</rs> met, its decisions would be of a nature to cause <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00153" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> serious inconvenience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>This <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00154" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> was unable to do. On the contrary, for <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure> previously to the meeting of the <rs>Convention</rs>, he had been uniformly defeated in all his attempts on both sides of the river, made evidently with a view to influence its proceedings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>The result of all these defeats was between <num value="9">nine</num> and <measure n="10000" type="prisoners">ten thousand prisoners</measure>, safely lodged in prison in this city, where they can be counted by anybody who may choose to take the trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>What the killed and wounded footed up, we cannot ascertain with any degree of accuracy, but it certainly did not fall short of <num value="5000">five thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>The only off set to this constant recurrence of all fortune was the capture of the <orgName n="Weldon Railroad" type="railroad">Weldon railroad</orgName>, and the repulse of an attempt made to recover it, with a loss to us of about <num value="800">eight hundred</num> men. This little breeze of good luck was sufficient for the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>It gave <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00155" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> something to go upon, and the telegraph was depended on the do the rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>The occasion was so serious that the talents of the great liar, <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00156" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName>, were put in requisition without, we think, sufficient cause; for <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00157" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> could have been depended on to write the telegrams, although he has been very generally beaten in the field since this campaign opened; or, if he distrusted his own invention, he has <num value="2">two</num> very promising subordinates in <placeName reg="Hancock, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,2047381">Hancock</placeName> and <persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00158" reg="nearbymention:Meade,G.,G.,,"><surname>Meade</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/> <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00159" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName>, it seems, telegraphs to <persName n="Dix,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00160" reg="mostcommon:Dix,nomatch:0"><surname>Dix</surname></persName>, that &#x0022;on <date>Thursday</date>, the <dateStruct value="--25"><day reg="25">25th</day></dateStruct>, <persName n="Hancock,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00161" reg="nearbymention:Hancock,W.,L.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hancock</surname></persName>, who was at <orgName n="Reams Station" type="station">Reams's station</orgName>, was attacked severed times during the day, but repulsed every assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>At <time value="5:30">half-past 5</time> in the evening, a combined attack was made on his centre and left, which, after <num value="1">one</num> of the most desperate assaults of the war, &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">resulted in the enemy withdrawing from the field, leaving their dead and wounded on the ground.</hi>&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/> This lie is so shameless, so impudent, and so bold, that we should feel disposed to credit it entirely to <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00162" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName> did not the telegraph further inform us that <persName n="Hancock,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00163" reg="nearbymention:Hancock,W.,L.,,"><surname>Hancock</surname></persName> had his full share in the invention.--That flogged general recovered breath from his drubbing in time to assure &#x0022;all whom it might concern,&#x0022; (and it concerns everybody who has any share in handling the <num value="1000">thousand</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num> that are appropriated every year to carry on this war,) in his official report, that his losses on the occasion will not exceed <num value="12">twelve</num> or <num value="1500">fifteen hundred</num> men, killed, wounded and missing, and that this was the most desperate fighting of the war. Now, the fact is, that <measure n="2070" type="prisoners">two thousand and seventy prisoners</measure>, taken in that engagement, were brought to this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>What the killed and wounded were we do not know; but we suppose they could hardly have been less than a <num value="1000">thousand</num>, if the fighting was so severe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>We took also <num value="9">nine</num> guns, which definite number is mystified by the report into &#x0022;several.&#x0022; This would be enough to show that <persName n="Hancock,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00164" reg="nearbymention:Hancock,W.,L.,,"><surname>Hancock</surname></persName> was completely routed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/><measure n="2000" type="prisoners">Two thousand prisoners</measure> and <num value="9">nine</num> guns, after an engagement of <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> only, tell a tale which defies the combined ingenuity of <persName n="Hancock,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00165" reg="nearbymention:Hancock,W.,L.,,"><surname>Hancock</surname></persName> and <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00166" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>Their meaning is too plain to be mistaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>They signify a complete rout; and so it was, if we may credit the report of those who were engaged in it, and who add that but for the seasonable arrival of night, <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Hancock,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00167" reg="nearbymention:Hancock,W.,L.,,"><surname>Hancock</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName> would have been utterly destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>So far from this being the severest engagement of the war, these participants say that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> fought very badly, as is proved by the fact of their having been routed in <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>. But <persName n="Hancock,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00168" reg="nearbymention:Hancock,W.,L.,,"><surname>Hancock</surname></persName> is anxious to save the reputation of his corps, and <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00169" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> does not wish it to be known that his troops have been demoralized by an almost uninterrupted series of defeats and disasters. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/> As these lies were concocted to answer a very important purpose, all the generals of any standing seemed to consider it a duty to contribute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/><persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00170" reg="nearbymention:Meade,G.,G.,,"><surname>Meade</surname></persName> telegraphs that the field is covered with dead rebels, (our whole loss, we now learn, very little exceeded <num value="500">five hundred</num>, though put down <num value="700">seven hundred</num> at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>,) and that the&#x0022;--guard talked with rebel officers, who said the rebel losses were greater than ever before during the war.&#x0022; It is a pity that neither the blank officer nor the rebel officer is named.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>Had they been, we might have felt disposed to believe that <persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00171" reg="nearbymention:Meade,G.,G.,,"><surname>Meade</surname></persName> actually heard this; as it is, we believe no more of it than he does himself; that is to say, not a word of it. No rebel officer made any such statement to any blank <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> officer, or anybody else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>It is a lie out of the whole cloth. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/> <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00172" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> could not let such a favorable opportunity pass without throwing in a lie of his own. He says the rebels cannot stand the losses on the <orgName n="Weldon Railroad" type="railroad">Weldon railroad</orgName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>Those losses do not exceed <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3000">three thousand</num> men, but <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00173" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName> says they foot up <num value="10000">ten thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00174" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s statements are not gospel, and his predictions do not always prove true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>He changes his determination occasionally, especially when he promises, as he once did, to fight it out on a certain line if it took him all summer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>He set out to come to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>Why did not he come, and why is he delaying now if the rebels cannot stand their losses on the <orgName n="Weldon Railroad" type="railroad">Weldon railroad</orgName>? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/> It is certain that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00175" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> looks with intense anxiety to the decisions of the <orgName n="Chicago Convention" type="convention">Chicago Convention</orgName>.--Otherwise he would not have put his machinery of flying into operation so extensively at this precise moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>The fact that there is such a convention at all, indicates that there is deep dissatisfaction with his measures; and the fact that he watches it with such intensity, and uses such disgraceful means to influence its proceedings, proves its importance in his estimation. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
