<div4 type="letter" n="1"> 
<head></head> <opener> <salute>Dear Sir:</salute> </opener> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/> --I returned a few days ago from a trip to <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>, and from my last as well as previous observations, am perfectly delighted with that section of the country, and regret that its intrinsic value has been so much overlooked in the past legislation of our State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>From a careful and minute examination, I am satisfied that we have there an inexhaustible mine of wealth. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/> Leaving the timber out of the question, a large quantity of which is now being shipped to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, its mineral resources are unlimited, and are naturally located under the most favorable auspices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>All that is requisite for their development is energy and enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>Were you to give them <sic>yor</sic> personal attention, the question would immediately present itself, why have they remained so long concealed? </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/> Iron could be manufactured as cheap, if not cheaper, in many of our western counties, than in any other section of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>Such, at present, is the want of facilities for bringing it into market, that it is impossible to compete with establishments more favorably located in this particular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>The development of this alone would contribute to the wealth and prosperity of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>It would give employment to labor and greatly enhance the value of property. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/> The oil, which has recently been discovered, has already contributed its share, and much more may be anticipated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>Lands which <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> ago would scarcely command <measure n="2dollars" type="currency">two dollars</measure> per acre, have since been sold for that many <num value="1000">thousands</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/> The manufacturing of oil from cannel coal is at present eliciting much attention in some of the counties of <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>This branch of industry must prove a source of profit to those engaged in it, and will be instrumental in bringing into our State a large amount of capital, and in retaining here much that has heretofore been sent to foreign markets for the purchase of illuminating fluids.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>In some sections of the <rs>State</rs> we have extensive fields of cannel coal, which, for quality, cannot be surpassed in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>It is only equalled by the bog-head coal of <placeName key="tgn,7002444" n="1.000 148" reg="scotland">Scotland</placeName>, which has always been considered the best known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>I have recently examined the <num value="2">two</num> and am satisfied that we have coal richer in illuminating properties, and which will produce a lighter and better oil than any heretofore brought into use. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/> In my recent trip I visited a small establishment lately erected at a cost not exceeding <measure n="10000dollars" type="currency">ten thousand dollars</measure>, at which they are producing from <num value="1500">fifteen hundred</num> to <num value="2000">two thousand</num> gallons of oil per week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/><num value="1">One</num> <num value="10">ten</num> of their coal yields from <num value="30">thirty</num> to <num value="35">thirty-five</num> gallons of oil. Their coal cost but <measure n="75cents" type="currency">75 cents</measure> per ton delivered at the factory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>After extracting the oil, they use the residuum or coke for fuel, so that their coal answers <num value="2">two</num> purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>The oil made at this establishment looses but from <num value="10">ten</num> to <num value="0.15">fifteen per cent.</num> in refining, while much of the oil from other cannel coal looses from <num value="40">forty</num> to <num value="0.6">sixty per cent.</num> This is always the case when the cannel coal is blended with the bituminous. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/> By an extension of machinery at the point referred to <num value="6000">six thousand</num> gallons could be produced per week with as much facility as <num value="2000">two thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>The present proprietors are working it on a safe and economical basis, and seem to be satisfied with their present prospect and profits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>At this point <measure n="60000dollars" type="currency">sixty thousand dollars</measure> might be judiciously and advantageously expended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>I have visited several <rs n="coal oil" type="product">coal-oil</rs> establishments in this and other States, but have seen none so favorably located as the <num value="1">one</num> just referred to. The coal is abundant, quality good, easily mined, and the market easy of access.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>Labor is cheap, and hiring very cheap. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/> It is supposed by some that the discovery of the petroleum or rock coal will cause a suspension of the manufacturing of oil from coal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>This is an erroneous impression, and arises from the fact that the <num value="2">two</num> oils are considered identical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>Such is not the fact &mdash; they differ materially in their constituent elements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>The oil pumped up can never be so refined as to make a good illuminating fluid, but is destined to become the indicating oil of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>Its application to machinery will take the place of other oils, and may yet be used on steam vessels as a fuel, for generating steam, instead of coal.--The <num value="2">two</num> oils can never be brought into competition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>For illuminating purposes we must depend on that produced from the cannel coal &mdash; which is now being generally introduced, and is certainly destined to supercede all other burning fluids, on account of its right cheapness and safety. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/> However, as you may not be or <unclear></unclear> interested particularly in coal or <rs n="coal oil" type="product">coal oil</rs>, enough for the present on that subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>The Board wisely concluded that to put any more State bonds upon the market, while the <name>Abolitionist</name> brokers of <orgName n="New York City" type="newspaper">New York city</orgName> are running them down <num value="0.6">sixty per cent.</num> below par, would be to prostrate the market for a long time to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/> It was expected yesterday that the <rs>Convention</rs> would adopt an ordinance establishing a union of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> with the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>, under the <rs>Constitution</rs> as amended at <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery</placeName>; and that the military organization and operations of the <rs>State</rs> would at once be places under the direction of the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities; at the same time that she would come under the operation of the <rs>Southern</rs> tariff and general civil jurisdiction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>Such a measure would be permanent, and final in fact; though it would, of course, be provisional in form until after the vote of the <date value="05-24">24th May</date> next.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>In a financial point of view, such a measure would be of immense value to <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>Of all the <rs>Southern States</rs>, she is the most heavily burdened with debt; her aggregate annual taxes being alone <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of the gross amount paid by the whole <num value="15">fifteen</num> Southern States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>At the same time that her debt is the heaviest of all, the entire brunt of the war would fall upon her armies, if she held aloof from the <rs>South</rs> and maintained a position of distrustful isolation; and of course, also, the whole cost of the war would fall upon her treasury.--Union with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> brings military co-operation at the same time that it brings a division of the expenses of the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>Besides, the cordial union of the whole <rs>South</rs> would have a moral effect at the <rs>North</rs> that would tend strongly to shorten the war, and thus may save a vast expenditure to the <rs>Southern</rs> treasury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>In a word, this continued isolation is a luxury of which the <rs>State</rs> has had enough, and of which she is heartily sated.--She is for the policy of the <name>Revolution</name>, the policy of union between all the <name>States</name> engaged in the same cause and struggle, in despite of the opposition and stubborn resistance of Tories. </p>
