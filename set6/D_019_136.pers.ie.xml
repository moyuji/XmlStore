<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>I hasten to give you a brief description, of the <rs n="Battle of Bethel" type="battle">battle of Bethel Church</rs>, which took place yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>For <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> previous we had been anticipating an attack by the <rs>Federal</rs> troops, and on Saturday had stood an hour in a marsh a waiting their approach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>On Sabbath afternoon at <num value="4">4</num>, the <num value="3">three</num> companies under command of <persName n="Smart,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Smart,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieut. Col.</roleName> <surname>Smart</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, began the erection of earth works in a grave yard to the right of the <rs type="place">Church</rs>, and beyond the <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>We continued the work till sunset, and made considerable progress.--This was the most advanced point of all the operations for defence &mdash; not very elevated, but the best that could be got. Yesterday morning at hall past <num value="3">three</num> the bugle sounded <q>&#x0022;to arms.&#x0022;</q> and in a few minutes the <num value="3">three</num> companies &mdash; to wit: <orgName n="Young Guard" type="guard">Young Guard</orgName>, CaptCharters; <orgName n="Henrico Southern Guard" type="guard">Henrico Southern Guard</orgName>, <persName n="Children,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Children,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt</roleName> <surname>Children</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Hanover, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2112147">Hanover</placeName>; and the <rs>Life Guard</rs>, <rs type="role2">Capt</rs> walker, all of the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 3">3d Regiment</orgName> of <orgName type="mil" key="VAVolunteer">Virginia Volunteers</orgName>, <persName n="Stuart,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant Col.</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> commanding &mdash; were under arms, and started for a position just this sine of the work on which they had been engaged the day before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>It was a mill dam, which had been converted into a redoubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>After halting here <num value="0.5">a half</num> hour, we were ordered to repair to our former position, on the little eminence to the right, in the grave-yard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Here we continued to work in the entrenchment, continuing it in a crescentic form, and concealing it from the enemy by newly-felled bushes and trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The boys worked well, and were cheered to the labor by the announcement that the enemy were certainly approaching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Just before the engagement, learning that the enemy distinguish themselves by white badges on their arms, we put them (of white cotton) on our hats, and thus saved some lives, doubleness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The fight. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> At <time value="9.5oclock">9&#x00BD; o'clock</time> we espied <num value="2">two</num> mounted men to our right, inspecting some <num value="50">fifty</num> cords of wood that lay upon the road, and, we feared, with a design of erecting a battery behind it. The <rs>Colonel</rs> dispatched a member of the <rs>Life Guard</rs> to approach them, under cover of some brushwood that skirted a branch, to examine them more closely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>After <num value="2">two</num> inspections with the glass, we feared the realization of our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>It appeared after wards that they were our friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>In a few moments the gleaming of hundreds of bayonets were seen just in our front, distant <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="800yards" type="distance">eight hundred yards</measure> above the top of a relic, and presently the wild cheering of the invaders was heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>In <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure> there after, <hi rend="italics">bang</hi>went the <placeName reg="Holiwitzer">Holiwitzer</placeName> battery <measure n="50yards" type="distance">fifty yards</measure> to our left, and just in front of the main road, by which the enemy were approaching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>In an instant the fire was returned with <name n="Great Spirit" type="divinity">great spirit</name>, and such a cannonading began as I never heard before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Shot and shell flew thick and fast, shaking the very earth by their reverberation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Thank and last fell the branches from the neighboring trees, and as the shell burst in the air, our men watched the curling smoke with pleasure rather than fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Our little detachment of Howitzers alluded to, under command of <persName n="Brown,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Brown,John,,,:1"><roleName n="Captain">Capt</roleName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, fought with <name n="Great Spirit" type="divinity">great spirit</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>We had a full view of their firing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>A ball from <num value="1">one</num> of their riffed cannon almost made me tremble for its effects even upon the enemy as it rushed right down the road at a capital range, and must have torn some of the enemy limb from limb.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Now. while our men canceled them-selves in the trenches keeping down their bayonets well from the sight of the enemy, I saw him deploy on our right, and presently sharpshooters leaped the fence just in front of us, about <measure n="250yards" type="distance">two hundred and fifty yards distant</measure> and we discovered them to be the (would be) famous Zouaves, in their red pants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Our men became very anxious to fire upon them and <persName n="Stuart,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Stuart,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>, who was above the breastwork fearlessly observing their approach, found it difficult to restrain them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>They had been thrown out doubtless to pick off our Howitzers, and were entirely ignorant of out position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/><q> &#x0022;Ready &mdash; aim &mdash; fire,&#x0022;</q> commanded the <rs>Colonel</rs>, and the front rank of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> platoon of the <rs>Life Guard</rs> was in a blaze and <num value="1">one</num> man certainly fell mortally wounded, and the rest threw them selves flat upon their faces and returned our fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>We continued to fire about <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure> by files, when the <name>Zouaves</name> got out of the open field much faster than they got into it. Concealing themselves behind; the fence and some neighboring houses, they continues a very well directed fire for perhaps an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The Minute balls whizzed after a fashion I never heard before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>It was by a merciful <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> that not a man of us was hurt.--None of the officers occupied the ditch except partially, and <num value="1">one</num> brave <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs> exposed his whole person to the enemy's fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The balls often threw up the fresh earth upon the tops of our embankments, showing that they had the right range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Our commander kept his eye on the right of our position, fearing the approach of artillery, which we were not in a condition to resist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/> As the law now stands, <num value="1">one</num> of the most difficult problems of the times is to determine what to do with suspected persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>There are constant arrests of men considered inimical to the <rs>South</rs> and to the <rs>State</rs> in the immediate neighborhood of our armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>These persons are arrested by the officers in command and in some instances sent back to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> to be dealt with by the legal officers of the <rs>State</rs> and Confederate Goverments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>In general they have committed no overt act of treason; and while they are known to be inimical, no evidence can be found of positive treason or criminality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>They can be arrested on no other ground than suspicion; and yet their arrest is almost essential to the public interests. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/> As yet there has been no suspension of the <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus writ;</hi> not by the <rs>Confederate President</rs> or the <rs>State Governor</rs>, because neither has power to do so; nor by either the <orgName n="State Convention" type="convention">State Convention</orgName> or the <orgName n="Confederate Congress" type="Congress">Confederate Congress</orgName> when they were in session, because the necessity of doing sow as not then apparent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/> The result is. that when suspicious persons are sent to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> by <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00152" reg="nearbymention:Beauregard,G.,T.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName></hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Magruder,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00153" reg="mostcommon:Magruder,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Magruder</surname></persName>,</hi> and they are taken before the officers of the law, it is impossible for those officers to do aught in their cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>There is no suspension of the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> and these officers have, therefore, no power to commit to jail on suspicion; and, even if there be some evidence of abetting the enemies of the <rs>South</rs>, the witnesses are absent and the proofs of the charges imperfect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>These officers are, therefore, either bound to discharge the prisoner for want of facts and of proofs, or, which is the utmost they can do, must stretch their powers so far as to send them to the <rs>Governor</rs>, to be held or sent out of the <rs>State</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/> lierne is a subject which evidently require some immediate legislation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>The legislator required is, a partial suspension of the provisions of the <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> act. It is competent under the <rs>Confederate Constitution</rs> for this to be done by the <orgName n="Confederate Congress" type="Congress">Confederate Congress</orgName> but the time yet to elapse before that body meets is too long for the emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>We suppose it is also competent for the <orgName n="State Convention" type="convention">State Convention</orgName> to pass such a law, armed as that body is with plenary powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>The conferring of this power upon the <orgName n="Confederate Congress" type="Congress">Confederate Congress</orgName> does not we take it for granted, render its exercise by the <orgName n="State Legislature" type="legislature">State Legislature</orgName> or Convention illegal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>The reason of the case seems to justify the exercise of the power by either the <rs>State</rs> or <orgName n="Federal Legislature" type="legislature">Federal Legislature</orgName>, in their discretion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/> Certainly the power ought to be exercised by <num value="1">one</num> or the other of these legislative bodies so far as to authorize judges, <rs type="role" n="Justice">justices</rs>, and commissioners, to commit suspected persons until the condition of the country so changes as to render their running at large not dangerous to the public safety. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/> There is an Ordinance of the <rs>Convention</rs>, passed towards its close, authorizing the arresting of suspected persons and the carrying them before justices and judges; but it authorizes this to be done in order that the prisoners may be <q>&#x0022;dealt with according to law.&#x0022;</q> If dealt with merely according to law they must be discharged on failure to prove some overt act of treason; they must not be held or even tried on suspicion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>If dealt with merely according to law, some of the most dangerous characters that ever infested a country must be turned loose to do their work of secret machination, correspondence, and treason, with impunity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/> There is nothing to prevent the legislative authority of the country from interposing to provide a remedy for these evils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>They have only to authorize the holding of all persons in confinement against whom there may appear reasonable cause of suspicion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>When the suspicion is light and the character of the suspected person be such as to warrant mild treatment, the officers of the army, of the <rs>State</rs>, or of the law might he authorized, instead of sending them to the common jail, to confine them as prisoners of war in other places, or within prescribed limits on parol.--In all times and in all countries, it has been deemed expedient and legitimate to curtail the liberties of citizens for cause, or on suspicion, during the pendency of invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>The Constitution expressly authorizes Congress to suspend <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> during such periods, and the present exigencies of the public imperatively demand that some legal authority should be vested in public officers, civil and military, over suspected persons. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>The arms consisted of broom- sticks, worn-out axes, rusty old muskets without locks, and <num value="1">one</num> individual carried a frying pan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>There is fighting to be done, and the <name>Grays</name> wish to have a hand in it as soon as possible; and when the opportunity is given them, you may rest assured they will acquit themselves with honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="949"/> The following letter, written by a Maryland woman to a female relative at the <rs>North</rs>, is its own argument and commendation.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="951"/> Your letter of the <num value="12" type="ordinal">12th</num> to my daughter demands because of its reference to myself, an answer from me. If you were not allied to me by <num value="1">one</num> of the closest ties of nature, I could in silence pass over its bitter denunciatious and its unjust representations of Southern sentiment and conduct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="952"/>While Northern mothers are sending forth their sons to imbrue their hands in the blood of Southern citizens &mdash; to burn and pillage our cities and towns, and ruthlessly outrages our women--Southern mothers, wives and sisters are giving their sons, husbands and brothers to the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of Battles and the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of Nations, with their prayers that He will not only bless them in their defence of their rights, their homes and firesides in the unholy war waged against them, but that He will have mercy upon their enemies and give them repentant and better hearse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="953"/>Our homes, our property, of whatever kind, are recognized and assured to us by the <rs>Constitution</rs> our fathers framed for our protection and safety, the rights we have under it have never been exerted to the prejudice of the <rs>North</rs>; but when we are proscribed and told that we shall not hold certain property guaranteed to us by the laws of the land, and that we shall not participate in the occupancy of the common territory of the <rs>Union</rs>, acquired by the sacrifice of the common treasure and common blood, and a mighty army is called to subjugate <num value="1">one</num> portion of the country to the insolent mandates of another, it is but natural that a free, enlightened and brave people should put themselves in a position of defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="955"/>to the last of life and property, to resist the aggressive spirit which seeks to strike down their liberties and to rob them of their property.
