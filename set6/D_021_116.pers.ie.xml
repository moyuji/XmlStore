<head>The ladies and the <rs>South</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> A <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> scribe in the <orgName n="Baltimore American" type="newspaper">Baltimore <hi rend="italics">American</hi></orgName> delivers himself of a disquisition upon the question, why the <rs>Southern</rs> ladies have always been against <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, and even a good many Northern ladies are on the <rs>Southern</rs> side?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>He admits that the facts are so, and can only find this reason for the mystery &mdash; that the ladies are fond of aristocracy and opposed to everything of a <rs n="Republican" type="political">republican</rs> character. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> Such a solution as this is worthy the profound philosopher from whom it emanates &mdash; That ladies have an irreconcilable antipathy to that which is low and coarse, is true enough, and that in this may be found <num value="1">one</num> reason for their ayersion to Lincolndom is undeniable.--Nothing could well be more intensely vulgar than the man whom the people of the <rs>North</rs> have deliberately chosen as their representative and ruler, though he is less nanseating in his undisguised blackgardisms than his prime minister, <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Seward,Wm,H.,,:1"><surname>Seward</surname></persName>: a creature even more depraved in his morals, whose elaborate imitation of the habits and manners of good society cannot conceal from the world that he is in no respect a well-bred man; and, what is far worse, has none of the instincts of a gentleman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Like the master is his following, and never, we suppose, since the world begun, were as many blackguards collected together under the banners of civilzation as the scrapings of all Christendom, the multitudinous <q>&#x0022;lewd fellows of the baser sort&#x0022;</q>--who have undertaken to subjugate this beautiful land.--That there are gentlemen among their military leaders, no <num value="1">one</num> doubts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/><persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,George,B.,,:1"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> has that reputation; but it has been a serious draw back to him with his party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The genuine <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> journals abuse him all the time, and indeed it is impossible that any public sentiment and public taste, of which <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName> is the recognized exponent, should pardon any man who is suspected of the double crimes of humanity and good manners. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> In taking such trouble to explain why the ladies are so universally with the <rs>South</rs>, the <hi rend="italics"><rs n="American" type="group">American</rs></hi> evidently feels the moral weight in our favor of this undeniable fact; but its solution of it is preposterous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The ladies are no doubt on the side of good manners and clean faces and hands, and it may be admitted that they do not admire people who utter through their noses all manner of rudeness and bad <persName n="English,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>; but these are the mere outward signs of an inward offensiveness that is the real cause of the antipathy that the <hi rend="italics"><rs n="American" type="group">American</rs></hi> finds such difficulty in explaining.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>So far as aristocracy is concerned, they have at the <rs>North</rs> an aristocracy of its sort &mdash; that is, an aristocracy of wealth, made up of people who had their orgin in the low places of the earth, have brought up with them all the essential vulgarity of their unclean beginnings, and are the most pretentious, ridiculous, and disgusting aristocracy on the face of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>If to dress in purple and fine linen, to live in splendid houses, and shine in fine carriages and liveried servants, make an aristocracy, the <rs>North</rs> has more than its share of it, whilst on the other hand, none of these things have ever distinguished to any great extent the <rs>Southern</rs> community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The manners of the <rs>Southern</rs> gentlemen are in general remarkable for their plainness; their style of living is simple, and the vulgar love of show and ostentation a thing unknown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Genuine aristocracy there may be; and when we can be shown a country which has not an aristocracy of some kind, whether it be a <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> or Monarchical country, it will have to be pointed out to us in some other planet than that which we inhabit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>In every country the enlightened and refined portion must and ought to have the ascendancy, and the time has gone by when to admit that self-evident fact could be denounced as high treason against republicanism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Intelligence, moral worth, and interests in the promotion of good order, must be the controlling influences in every social system that is not destined speedily to relapse into chaos.--Demagogues may inveigh as much as they choose against aristocracy, but it is only that they may become aristocrats themselves.--Whatever may be said against the hereditary nobility of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, we believe that it is the best part of that kingdom, morally, intellectually, and even physically.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>But to say that the ladies of the <rs>South</rs> and those generous Northern ladies who sympathise with us; are actuated in their sympathies by a love of aristocracy, unless it be conceded that aristocracy is a synonyme for all that is good and beautiful in politics and morals is as great a piece of nonsense as the <name>Batimore</name> <hi rend="italics"><rs n="American" type="group">American</rs></hi> ever uttered. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> The mothers, wives, and daughters of the <rs>South</rs> have deeper and purer motives than their enemies can comprehend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>They may not comprehend the mysteries of politics; they may not be able to harmonise the independence of State and Federal sovereignties; but they justinctively recoil from injustice, oppression, and from what is worse than all, contact with evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Woman is the custodian of the virtue of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>She is the fountain either of sweet or bitter influences to the whole human race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The Southern women, refined, pious, and high-toned to a degree never surpassed by the women of any other race, have long dreaded the evil effects of Northern morals and manners upon Southern society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>They have shrunk appalled from that seething flood of infidelity, fanaticism, licentiousness, and falsehood, which composes at this day the elements of Northern society, and have prayed Heaven that a wall of separation might be built up high as Heaven itself between this bottomless abyss of corruption and their own happy homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>This is <num value="1">one</num> reason why the women of the <rs>South</rs> sympathise with secession, and reason enough, without seeking another in that dislike of vulgar and coarse people which the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> sneers at as <q>&#x0022;aristocracy,&#x0022;</q> but which is nevertheless natural to the sex and not altogether unreasonable. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head>Our position.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> We were told by an esteemed city contemporary last week, in a tone which we took to be semi-official, that the manner of conducting the war was to be changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Already we have symptoms of the truth of this revelation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Our troops appear to be in motion everywhere, and a brisk campaing seems to have been inaugurated, from the <rs>Mississippi</rs> to the <rs>Atlantic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>That the effect will be favorable, we have not a doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Our troops desire nothing more than to be led against the enemy.--That is the universal sentiment everywhere.--They have a noble confidence in themselves &mdash; a confidence quite distinct from that rash presumption which is accustomed to underrate the enemy, and is too often the precursor of defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>They know this well the mettle of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, for they have tested it on many a field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>They know that they are brave, and that they will nowhere leave them a bloodless, or even an easy victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>They are well aware that they are superior in arms and equipage, and that they greatly outnumber them in men and horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Yet they have a steady and ra- <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> tional confidence in their own prowess, and do not believe that they will be overcome on the trial of strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>This is the proper temper for soldiers, and it is the surest harbingers of success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Their countrymen &mdash; and what is more, their countrywomen &mdash; have reposed equal trust in them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>They believe their cause to be safe in their hands, and they resign themselves to hope, unmixed with fear for the event. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> Yet it must not be imagined that the war is to be short, or that it is to be decided by a few violent, spasmodic efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>It promises, on the other hand, to be a long and deadly struggle &mdash; a struggle that may last for years, and call for all the courage and all the fortitude of which we are masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Many a bloody field must be stricken before we can arrive at the conclusion which all desire, but which is not yet within the view of any. We shall still, doubtless, he often called on to exercise the virtues of fortitude and perseverance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>We shall often meet with reverses, and trials of faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>But so surely as we are a firm and united people, so surely will our success be complete in the end. The worst is over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>We have been tried in the furnace of affliction and we have been found equal to the task of enduring the worst that can be put upon us. Our sufferings hereafter will be less, because they will be borne with less effort. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> We have never entertained a doubt that we were more than a match for the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> on land, at a distance from their boats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>We have seen nothing, so far, to shake this conviction in the slightest degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>In the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs> not less than in the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>, and on the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, we shall now have constant opportunities of testing his strength at a distance from these formidable auxiliaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Already fortune begins to turn, and she will remain with us if we continue true to ourselves. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="3"> 
<head>Throwing down trees.</head>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>These gunboats can shell a city, and burn it down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>There is no currency but Confederate notes and private issues, of various and uncertain responsibility, but all resting on their exchangability into Confederate notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>To make the use of these notes a crime, was, as far as such a decree could be enforce against a people threatened by it with starvation, to extingush the capacity of a <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> people to buy their daily food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>The other branch of the subsistence question relates to supplies from abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>The stock of food of all kinds is small and diminishing; and among the poor, privations are already extremely distressing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/> The pigmy size of Rumor in its inception the small beginnings in which it originates, its rapid growth and the portantous bulk to which it attains, is here set forth with equal spirit and accuracy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>Every inhabitant, and every sojourner of this city, has had ample opportunities within the last week to verify the excellence of the portrait.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>There has been no end to the lies which Rumor has been continually spreading from her iron trumpet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>They are stuck to, too, with the most astonishing pertinacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>Smolist gives us an example of the manner in which Rumor dilates and expands as it moves along.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>It was reported that an old gentleman had vomited <num value="6">six</num> black crows in a sudden spell of illness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>The authority was given up. When appealed to, he said he had only mentioned <num value="3">three</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>It was traced back until it dwindled down to a single black crow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>The investigator still did not give it up. He followed it until he came to the original propagator, who said he had only mentioned that the sick man had thrown up something as black as a crow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>Rumor is like the mustard seed mentioned in Scripture, (if we may make the comparison without irreverence.) It grows and expands into an enormous tree, that obscures the very light of the sun, by the time it is fairly planted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>Most of our rumors come from persons calling themselves couriers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>Whether they are really such, we do not know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>It is probable that some of them are, and that finding everybody all agog for news, they merely exercise what they regard as innocent ingenuity, in testing their capacity for digestion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>Others are certainly not couriers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>But every rumor by whomsoever invented, is indebted for the size it attains to each separate transmitter.--A <q>&#x0022;courier&#x0022;</q> tells some wonder-loving citizen that a skirmish has been-fought, in which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> lost <num value="12">twelve</num> men. The citizen tells his neighbor, adding a little to it. Each new hand adds his quots, until at last the dozen swell to <num value="6000">six thousand</num>. <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisoners are no small hands at a rumor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>From them came, no doubt, that notable <num value="1">one</num> which was current a few days ago, that <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00071" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,George,B.,,:1"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> had prepared to throw <num value="50000">50,000</num> shells a minute into <placeName reg="York, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,7017623">York</placeName>, when it was evacuated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>As this is a fair example by which to estimate the size to which a rumor may grow, we shall take the trouble to analyse it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> shells, they tell us, weigh about <measure n="200l." type="pounds"><num value="200">200</num> pounds</measure> each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>The gun that throws them weighs about <measure n="20000l." type="pounds"><num value="20000">20,000</num> pounds</measure>. As both gun and shell are so heavy, we do not think the latter could be fired on an average oftener than twice a minute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>To perform the feat indicated, therefore, it would require <num value="25000">25,000</num> cannon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>As they are so heavy they could not be dragged into position by less than a dozen horses each, which would give <num value="300000">300,000</num> horses for the guns alone, leaving out the ammunition, which is no small item, since each shell must be fired by <measure n="40l." type="pounds"><num value="40">forty</num> pounds</measure> of powder, making for shell and powder <measure n="240l." type="pounds"><num value="240">240</num> pounds</measure> each, or for the whole <num value="50000">50,000</num> per minute, <num value="12000000">12,000,000</num> per minute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>Then it would take a dozen men to man each piece, or <num value="300000">300,000</num> men to man the whole <num value="25000">25,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/> With my eyes full of burnt powder, and my ears filled with the ringing of musketry and the <unclear>screaching</unclear> of bomb shells, I sit down to endeavor to give you an account of a fight that has raged here since <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time> this morning, and which is still continuing, although I just now heard the cry that the rebels were retreating. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>The last of this division of the grand <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName> arrived here yesterday afternoon, under command of <persName n="Franklin,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00215" reg="nearbymention:Franklin,John,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Franklin</surname></persName>, and by dark most of the troops were landed on a beautiful plain, <unclear>whith</unclear> is surrounded on <num value="3">three</num> sides by dense woods and on the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> by the river, on the south side of the <placeName key="tgn,7017624" n="1.000 27" reg="pamunkey, virginia, united states">Pamunkey river</placeName>, and about half a mile southward from <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>The reason why we landed here is obvious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>Had we landed on the other side of the river &mdash; <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> &mdash; where it was at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> intended we should land, we should then have had a considerable stream of water between us and the rebels, and would have had considerable trouble to reach them, as all the bridges have been destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>Our gunboats have taken undisputed possession of the point, the rebels having disappeared at the appearance of our forces, and the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> flag of our Union now floats from <num value="1">one</num> of the most prominent buildings in the village.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>I have yet to see a white man among the original inhabitants of this palce. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/> Immediately on the landing of our forces from the transports pickets were thrown out to the edges of the surrounding wood, and our tents were pitched on the banks of the river, and up to that time not <num value="1">one</num> of the chivalric sons of the sunny <rs>South</rs> had made his appearance, and our men became anxious to know why they had been brought <unclear></unclear> country where there was no foe. About dusk a part of the <orgName>division of <persName n="Sedgwick,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00216" reg="mostcommon:Sedgwick,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sedgwick</surname></persName></orgName>, under the command of <persName n="Dana,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00217" reg="mostcommon:Dana,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Dana</surname></persName>, arrived in transports from <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName> and remained in the centre of the river, while some of our light draught gunboats took a trip up the rivers <placeName key="tgn,7017624" n="1.000 27" reg="pamunkey, virginia, united states">Pamunkey</placeName> and <placeName reg="Mataponi river">Mataponi</placeName> to capture a portion of the rebel <orgName n="Mosquito Fleet" type="fleet">mosquito fleet</orgName>, which were brought into use for carrying our men from the transports to the shore, as the river here is too shallow for vessels drawing over <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> of water. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/> During the night some of the rebel pickets made a sortie on <num value="1">one</num> of our advanced videttes and shot him through the heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/>The news soon spread through the camp, and by daylight this morning the plain, which takes in about a <measure n="1000acres" type="area">thousand acres</measure> of ground, running southwest from the <placeName key="tgn,7017623" n="1.000 8" reg="york, virginia, united states">York river</placeName>, presented a scene such as I have never before witnessed Long lines of men extended from left to right across the centre of the field, and squads of skirmishers stood marking, in dim outline, their forms against the heavy woods and underbrush, which presents an unbroken front to us on every side except that bounded by the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>Here the memstood for sometime, ready to march at a moments notice; but no foe appeared, and the men were permitted to return to their camps for the purpose of getting their breakfast, and perhaps, some sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/>A strong picket, composed of the <orgName type="regiment" n="NY32">New York 32d</orgName>, <num value="95" type="ordinal">95th</num> and <orgName type="regiment" key="PA96">96th Pennsylvania</orgName> troops, were left at the edges of the woods to keep a sharp lookout for the enemy, who were now believed to be in close proximity to our lines. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/> About this time <num value="1">one</num> of our gunboats discovered a regiment or <num value="2">two</num> of the enemy on the west side of the river, who dispersed in great confusion after having received some half dozen of our heavy shells in their midst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>This was communicated to <persName n="Slocum,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00218" reg="mostcommon:Slocum,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Slocum</surname></persName>, who immediately made strenuous efforts to get the brigade; of <persName n="Dana,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00219" reg="mostcommon:Dana,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Dana</surname></persName> on shore, that we miget be able to give the enemy a warm reception should he make his appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>Our men pressed on, and gave them a volley, after which the enemy retreated further into the woods, with the <orgName type="regiment" key="NY32">32d New York</orgName> close at their heels; but they were too swift-footed for our boys &mdash; being more protected and they soon left the <num value="32" type="ordinal">32d</num> struggling in the mud. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/> While this scene had been going on on the right centre another was transpiring on the centre where the <orgName type="regiment" key="PA95">Ninety-fifth Pennsylvania</orgName> had entered the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>In a few moments after they entered they found themselves in a dense swamp, and in their struggles to get across became separated from each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/><num value="1">One</num> of the companies managed to get to the other side, and was climbing the bank on the opposite side when they descried a party of soldiers lying in ambush.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/><q>&#x0022;Who comes there?&#x0022;</q> cried the party in ambush, <q>&#x0022;Friends,&#x0022;</q> was the answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>In this affair <persName n="Beateass,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00221" reg="mostcommon:Beateass,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Beateass</surname></persName>, of <orgName type="company" n="Company B">company B</orgName>, was shot through the shoulder, but not dangerously wounded, and <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> privates, whose names I am as yet unable to learn, were killed and carried off the field by their friends, who, before they quit the ground, revenged the fall of their brave comrades by giving the enemy a <unclear></unclear> well directed volleys. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/> But now the action became general throughout the lines, and from every quarter of the woods came the sharp crack of musketry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>I tried for a time to be <unclear>obiquitous,</unclear> but after traveveling from <num value="1">one</num> point to another some <num value="50">fifty</num> times, for the purpose of seeing how matters were going, I took my stand on the right, and caimly awaited the coming events.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>The sharp reports came nearer and nearer, and at length a ball lodged in a tree at my side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>I was about to move from my dangerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/><milestone unit="column" n="6"/> quarters when my attention was attracted to that portion of the woods where the <num value="31" type="ordinal">Thirty-first</num> and <orgName type="regiment" key="32NYStateMilitia">Thirty-second New York State Militia</orgName> had entered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/><num value="4">Four</num> men were carrying the body of a man, which, upon inquiry, I understood to be that of <persName n="Young,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00222" reg="mostcommon:Young,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Young</surname></persName>, of <rs type="role">Com.</rs> G., of the <unclear> d</unclear> regiment, who was shot in the throat, and died instantly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/>The fight had now been going on for <measure n="9hours" type="date">9 hours</measure> here without intermission, and a number of men were killed and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>At this juncture our men were withdrawn from the wood where they were evidently getting the worst of it, and the <orgName type="regiment" key="2USArtillery">second United States artillery</orgName>, under <persName n="Arnold,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00223" reg="mostcommon:Arnold,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Arnold</surname></persName>, was ordered into position on the right, and <orgName type="regiment" key="1MABattery"><persName n="Porter,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00224" reg="mostcommon:Porter,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Porter</surname></persName>'s First Massachusetts battery</orgName> took up a position upon the left, and in a few minutes the shell were flying through the air at the rate of about <num value="10">ten</num> a minute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>This soon compelled the rebels to make a move more on our left, where the shells flew less thick than upon the ground they were then occupying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/>But there evidently is no rest for the wicked; for no sooner had the rebels moved their forces upon our left, than our gunboats, which up to that time had been unable to have a hand in the affair, opened their batteries upon the foe with so much effect that, when I commenced to write they had completely driven the enemy out of sight and hearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>I am inclined to think that this move upon our left was an expensive <num value="1">one</num> to the rebels, who, ere this reaches the readers of the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> will have learned that near our gunboats is not <num value="1">one</num> of the safest places that can be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>As soon as the guns of <persName n="Porter,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00225" reg="mostcommon:Porter,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Porter</surname></persName> commenced to fire among them, accompanied by those from the river, the rebels undertook to move <num value="1">one</num> of their batteries which they had got into position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>The <orgName type="mil" key="NJRegiment">New Jersey regiment</orgName> received orders to charge upon this battery, and at it they went, with cheers that made the very forests ring; but the rebels were again too fleet-footed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>Before the <rs>Jersey</rs> boys got through the woods, the enemy had made tall traveling, and got of sight in the woods. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/> Everybody has done well, and the troops have acted nobly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>They have been under arms all day thus far, standing in the broiling sun without anything whatever to eat, except that which they may have had in their haversacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>I have yet to hear a word of complaint from any quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>The idea of having an opportunity to have a fight with the rebels seems to have absorbed all their other faculties. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/> More troops are constantly arriving, and just now <orgName n="Massachusetts Company" type="company"><persName n="Saunders,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00226" reg="nearbymention:Saunders,James,M.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Saunders</surname></persName>'s company of Massachusetts</orgName>, sharp shooters pass by me on their road to the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/>These are the men who are able to teach the rebels that <num value="2">two</num> parties can lay concealed in the woods. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>The artillery has now ceased firing, and I hear nothing except the occasional discharge of a musket; it seems to be far off towards <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>I think we have got into their rear, and, if we have, we intend halting them for a few hours until <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00227" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,George,B.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> can come up to carry them back to their deserted quarters at <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/> Sir: We observe indications of a growing impression in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> that the demonstration made by the <rs>Spanish</rs>, <name>French</name> and <name>British</name> forces against <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> is likely to provoke a revolution in that country, which shall bring aboat the introduction of a monarchical government, and the assumption of the crown by a foreign prince.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/><orgName n="Our Country" type="newspaper">Our country</orgName> is deeply interested in the peace of the world, and desires to preserve loyal relations as well with the allies as with <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> has therefore directed me to submit to the parties interested his views on the new aspect of affairs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/> <placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> has relied upon the assurance given his Government by the <name>Allies</name>, that they were in pursuit of no political object, but simply the redress of their grievances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>He entertains no doubt of the sincerity of the <name>Allies</name>, and if his confidence in their good faith had been disturbed, it would be restored by the frank explanations given by them that the <name>Governments</name> of <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, <placeName reg="Espana" key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> have no intention of intervening to procure a on sage in the constitutional form of Government now existing in <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, or any political change which should be in opposition to the will of the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>In short, he has cause to believe that the <name>Allies</name> are unanimous in declaring that revolution proposed to <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> is solely prompted by certain <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> citizens who are now in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/> Nevertheless, the <rs>President</rs> regards it as his duty to express to the <name>Allies</name>, in all kindness and candor, that a monarchical government established in <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, in the presence of foreign fleets and armies, occupying the waters and the soil of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, has no promise of security or permanence; in the second place, that the instability of such a monarchy would be enhanced in the throne were assigned to a <unclear>per </unclear> to <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>; that in these circumstances the new government would instantly fail unless sustained by <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> alliances, which, under the influence of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> invasion, would be practically the beginning of a permanent policy of armed intervention by monarchical <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, at once injurious and inimical to the system of government generally adopted by the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> continent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="832"/> These views are based upon some knowledge of the opinions and political habits of <orgName n="American Society" type="society">American society</orgName>, There can be no doubt that in this matter the permanent interes's and the sympathies of our country would be on the side of the other <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> republics. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/> We <unclear>mu </unclear> not be understood as predicting on this occasion the course of events which may ensue, both in <placeName reg="America, Wabash, Indiana" key="tgn,2131960">America</placeName> and in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, from the steps which are contemplated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>It is enough to say that in the opinion of the <rs>President</rs>, the emancipation of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> continent from the control of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> has been the principal characteristic of the past half century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>It is not probable that a revolution in the opposite direction can succeed in the age which immediately follows this period, and while the population of <placeName reg="America, Wabash, Indiana" key="tgn,2131960">America</placeName> increases so rapidly, while its resources develop in the same proportion, and while society forms itself uniformly according to the principles of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> democratic government. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/> It is ennecessary to indicate to the <name>Allies</name> how improbable it is that the nations of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> would secept cheerfully a policy favorable to a similar counter-revolution, thus incompatible with their own proper interests Nor is it necessary to point out that, notwithstanding the care of the <name>Allies</name> to avoid aiding, by means of their land and maritime forces the internal revolutions of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, the result would be none the less due to the presence of their forces in the country, however different the object they may have proposed; for without their presence it may be considered as certain that such revolutions would probably not have been attempted or even conceived. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/> The <orgName n="United States Senate" type="senate">Senate of the United States</orgName> has certainly not accorded its official sanction to the precise measures proposed by the <rs>President</rs>, to land our aid to the actual <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> Government, in order that the latter might, with the approbation of the <name>Allies</name>, extricate itself from its present embarrassments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="838"/>But this is strictly a question of internal administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="839"/>There could be no greater error than to see in this disagreement a divergence of opinion in our Government, or in the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> people, in regard to their cordial wishes for the safety, weifare, and stability of the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> Government in that country. </p> <closer> <salute>I am your obed't serv't,</salute> <signed><persName n="Seward,,Wm,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00365" reg="default:Seward,Wm,H.,,"><foreName>Wm</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName>  <surname>Seward</surname></persName>.</signed> </closer> </div4> </div3>
