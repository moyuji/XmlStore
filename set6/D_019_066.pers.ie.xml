He read statistics of the trade of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> in the articles of clothing, shoes, hats, &#x0026;c., showing that a large proportion thereof, formerly manufactured here, was now manufactured at the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Under the revenue system of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, we would receive protection for our own manufactures, while the more costly fabrics would be supplied to us from abroad, where our agricultural productions would be wanted in return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>He gave a history of the causes which had tended to build up the commerce of the <rs>North</rs>, and to depress that of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>With regard to the reports from the <rs>Committee</rs> on Federal Relations, he objected to those which involved an application to the <rs>Northern</rs> people, for he believed none of them would be successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>They could not succeed without overturning all the official weight of the <rs>North</rs>, and changing the entire popular sentiment of that section.--He objected, also, to waiting an indefinite period of time to make such an experiment; for in the meanwhile all our commercial advantages would be lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Even if they accepted the proposition, the <rs>South</rs> might refuse it, and thus we would be entirely cut off from our natural market, and subjected to the embrace of the <rs>Northern</rs> bear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>He thought our efforts should be towards an alliance with the <rs>South</rs>, for at the <rs>North</rs> we should meet nothing but ruinous competition, while in the other direction a broad field was open for commercial and agricultural operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>If another effort were to be made to adjust the difficulty with the <rs>North</rs>, he thought a demand should be made such as the <rs>South</rs> could subscribe to, and fix a time for the limitation of negotiations; not keep the people in this present ruinous state of uncertainty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>The best plan, he conceived, would be to adopt the report submitted by the gentleman from <placeName reg="Amelia Court House, Amelia, Virginia" key="tgn,2110319">Amelia</placeName>, (<hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Harvie,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="mostcommon:Harvie,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Harvie</surname></persName>,</hi>) and take the <rs>State</rs> out of the <rs>Union</rs> at once. -- With regard to the causes which ought to induce such a step, he went on to show that the prime object of the <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> was to abolitionize the country, and read from <num value="1">one</num> of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00030" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s speeches, wherein he said that any man who held a slave ought to be himself a slave, and by the help of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> such a result would be attained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>Though the <name>Inaugural</name> had said that he did not mean to interfere with slavery where it exists, the tendency of the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> doctrine was, he argued, to exterminate it everywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>The entire experience of history taught that when a Government was abolitionized, the doom of slavery was sealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>The conversion of the iron-bound fanaticism of the <rs>North</rs> was the most absurd of all absurdities., <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> ought to take a stand now &mdash; at once and forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>The time had come when we were <num value="2">two</num> sections, divided in everything, with no hope of reconciliation. -- He believed that conjunction with the <rs>South</rs> was a peace measure; that if <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> would secede, all threats of war by the <rs>North</rs> would be abandoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>With regard to <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, and the border States, he would regret it if they refused to join us; but he believed such would not be the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>Whether they joined us or not, <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> would be much better situated with the <rs>South</rs> than with the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/> I was here some <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> ago, and wrote you from this place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>Some of your readers about <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> thought the letter an amusing fabrication, and the people in this immediate neighborhood thought is an ill-tempered exposure of their poverty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>The editor of a paper in this region assailed my motives, and some of his county correspondents regarded it as being wanting in truthfulness; but I stated facts simply then, and I hope I shall be equally sincere and candid now. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/> This country (the <rs>Northwest</rs>,) has, within the period above named, improved remarkably --no part of it more than this little settlement or village from which I write to-night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>Instead of a miserable cabin for a hotel, I am seated in a large, well-arranged hotel, of ample dimensions for any village of this size in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>The accommodations generally are good, and I hear no word whatever of complaint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>I have no disposition to imitate my course when here before &mdash; i. e., leave before daybreak to-morrow, but may remain here several days. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/> As many of your readers may wish to know how to get out here, I will tell them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>It you take the <rs>Fredericksburg</rs> train any morning, you will, without accident, be put down the following morning either at Ellenboro', <placeName reg="Cairo Junction, Alexander, Illinois" key="tgn,7018995">Cairo</placeName>, or at <placeName reg="Petroleum, Ritchie, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119557">Petroleum</placeName>, on the <rs type="place">Parkersburg branch</rs> of the <orgName n="Baltimore and Ohio Railroad" type="railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</orgName>, and from either of these points horses can be had to the &#x0022;wells.&#x0022; The latter point will be found the most convenient, as horses can be gotten there without difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>The hire (<measure n="1.50dollars" type="currency">$1.50</measure> per day) is very high for this country, as heretofore it was only <measure n="50cents" type="currency">50 cents</measure>. I went to the wells yesterday from <placeName reg="Ritchie Court-House">Ritchie Court-House</placeName>, where I had business, and although everybody with whom I conversed had something to say about the &#x0022;wells,&#x0022; yet I was not fully, indeed, not at all, prepared for what I really witnessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>My road lay, for the most part, through a rough and uninhabited country, and just before reaching the &#x0022;wells, &#x0022; along a very high ridge from which a view of the country for many miles around was obtained, away in the west, I saw the rising town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>Cabin after cabin ranged along the hill- side, so <hi rend="italics">new</hi> that you imagined they were as yet unoccupied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>I was forcibly reminded of the ideas I had conceived in regard to some newly- discovered &#x0022;<persName n="Diggins,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00093" reg="mostcommon:Diggins,nomatch:0"><surname>Diggins</surname></persName>&#x0022; in <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>Presently we began to descend the ridge and wind around its base, when all at once the solitude of my long journey across the mountains was exchanged for the bustle and hum of city life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>I had always spoken to every man, woman and child I met in the road, but now I did not think of it. There were squads of men standing in the muddy roads, while ox-carts, loaded with timber, were struggling along the deep ravines, and recently-felled trees and split boards lay on every side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>I had never seen anything like it before; and as I got nearer the village I saw, not far off, derrick after derrick, with men busily engaged at the base and upon the top of them, boring for the precious oil. My excitement quickened rapidly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>I hastened forward, my horse throwing the muddy water from, heels to head, until I found myself in the midst of the &#x0022;<persName n="Wells,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00094" reg="mostcommon:Wells,nomatch:0"><surname>Wells</surname></persName>,&#x0022; and soon at the door of a hotel, half-finished, with no steps to the front door, so that it was necessary to enter the back way &mdash; the house being on a steep hill-side, there was no difficulty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>I never saw such a &#x0022;mess,&#x0022; to use a vulgar expression, before-- saddles and saddle-bags, bags of beans, dried apples, peaches and potatoes, and barrels of flour, all piled up together in the passage and in the dining-room, amid mud and dirt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>I looked for a stable, but it had not been built &mdash; a shed for the present sufficed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>The bar-room, as usual, was crowded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>But I must not trespass upon your readers, but give you, in as few words as possible, a description of the &#x0022;wells;&#x0022; and, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, as to how they are dug: After the rock is reached, a few feet below the surface, the machinery for digging is prepared &mdash; a scaffold, about <measure n="35feet" type="distance">35 feet</measure> high, <num value="8">8</num> or <measure n="10feet" type="distance">10 feet</measure> square at the base, and about <num value="4">4</num> or <measure n="5feet" type="distance">5 feet</measure> at the top, made of <num value="4">four</num> poles, united by scantling, is erected; at the top of this is a &#x0022;block,&#x0022; through which a rope is passed, by which the long &#x0022;sinker, &#x0022; made of iron, pointed with steel, is lifted and let fall.--After the well has been dug to a considerable depth rods are screwed on, thus lengthening the shaft; and, in order to lift it, a long pole is used, called a <q>&#x0022;scoop,&#x0022;</q> (often <measure n="50feet" type="distance">50 feet</measure>,) <num value="1">one</num> end of which is fastened to the ground, and the other is attached to the top of the rod, by which it is lifted from the bottom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>These rods are not more than <measure n="2inches" type="distance">two inches</measure> in diameter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>The &#x0022;well&#x0022; is, therefore, very small &mdash; not more than <hi rend="italics"><num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4inches" type="distance">four inches</measure></hi> in diameter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>If you have seen poles used in raising water from wells, you will readily understand what I mean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>The men (<num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> of them) at the top of the scaffold swing upon the end of the pole to which the sinker is attached, thus thrusting it down, and &#x0022;poking&#x0022; the bottom, followed by a metallic &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">click; </hi>&#x0022; and again letting go the pole, the sinker is again raised; and so they continue, occasionally pulling up the apparatus to pump out the water and debris.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>The cost of boring is about <measure n="1.75dollars" type="currency">$1.75</measure> per foot for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <measure n="100feet" type="distance">hundred feet</measure>, and <measure n="2dollars" type="currency">$2</measure> for all beyond.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>Within a space of <measure n="0.5mile" type="distance">a half-mile</measure> there are about <num value="150">150</num> &#x0022;wells,&#x0022; either already dug or in process of digging.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>They begin on the Little Kanawha, <measure n="200yards" type="distance">200 yards</measure> or more below the mouth of &#x0022; <placeName reg="Burning Spring, Washington, Ohio" key="tgn,2208568">Burning Spring</placeName> Rup,&#x0022; and continue up the run to its source.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>There are only <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> wells that are yielding oil. All who have gone deep enough have been rewarded with success--<hi rend="italics">not a single well has been abandoned.</hi> Perhaps <num value="4">four</num>-<num value=".2">fifths</num> of the wells have been very recently begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>The progress made is from <num value="1">one</num> foot to <num value="10">ten</num> or <measure n="15feet" type="distance">fifteen feet</measure> per day. Some wells have been in process of digging for <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4weeks" type="date">four weeks</measure>, but have not gotten more than <measure n="120feet" type="distance">120 feet</measure>. The average depth is from <num value="115">115</num> to <measure n="145feet" type="distance">145 feet</measure>. Some persons have gone <measure n="200feet" type="distance">200 feet</measure> without finding oil, but are not discouraged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>Some dig on the hill-sides, but most of them in the bottom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>I visited every well that was yielding oil. That of <orgName><persName n="Llewellyn,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00095" reg="mostcommon:Llewellyn,nomatch:0"><surname>Llewellyn</surname></persName> &#x0026; Co.</orgName> was yielding very rapidly; often it produces <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num> barrel per minute.</hi> Think of it!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>I saw them filling <measure n="7barrels" type="mass">seven barrels</measure> at the same time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>A friend timed them, and they filled <measure n="14barrels" type="mass">14 barrels</measure> in <measure n="15minutes" type="date">15 minutes</measure>--i. e., <measure n="140dollars" type="currency">one hundred and forty dollars</measure> in <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of an hour, or <measure n="560dollars" type="currency">$560</measure> per hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>This is making money after a fashion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>I never saw before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>The oil sells readily at <measure n="25cents" type="currency">25 cents</measure> per gallon, or <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">$10</measure> per bbl.--The expense of getting it is a mere nothing, after you once reach it. Sometimes it runs spontaneously, at other times it is pumped up. The flat-boats (of which I saw upwards of <num value="100">100</num>,) take it to <placeName reg="Parkersburg, Wood, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119512">Parkersburg</placeName>, in <measure n="24hours" type="date">24 hours</measure>. Day before yesterday <num value="2000">2,000</num> or <measure n="3000barrels" type="mass">3,000 barrels</measure> left the &#x0022;wells&#x0022; for that destination. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/> The well of <orgName><persName n="Llewellyn,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00096" reg="mostcommon:Llewellyn,nomatch:0"><surname>Llewellyn</surname></persName> &#x0026; Co.</orgName> is much the most productive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>There are several others that yield <num value="30">30</num> and <measure n="40barrels" type="mass">40 bbls.</measure> per day. Many of the wells are not worked, for want of barrels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>If my friends, <orgName><persName n="Weston,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00097" reg="mostcommon:Weston,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Weston</surname></persName> &#x0026; Co.</orgName>, will bring <num value="1">one</num> of their admirable stave-cutters out here, they will get abundant employment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>Barrels bring <measure n="2dollars" type="currency">$2</measure> apiece.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>The timber here is superb, and very abundant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>There is a small cooper's establishment here, but no steam used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>The oil is peculiar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>I saw some when out here <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> ago, at <placeName reg="Roane Court- House">Roane Court- House</placeName>, exuding from a marsh, which was black and viscid, somewhat like tar; but this is fluid, and of a &#x0022;bottle-green&#x0022; color, sometimes yellow, like molasses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>Its specific gravity is about <num value="40">40</num> deg., water being <num value="60">60</num> deg. It is as liquid as the &#x0022;fluid&#x0022; which you burn in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and is used here in fluid lamps, and, I understand, does not smoke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>It can, as you know, be refined and made perfectly limpid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>I learn this is done at little expense at several places on the <rs>Ohio</rs>, and also in New York, whenever much of it is shipped. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/> Well, <persName n="Editor,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00098" reg="mostcommon:Editor,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Editor</surname></persName>, would you not like to take a lease after all this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>If you wish <num value="0.5">a half</num> acre lot you must pay <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">$500</measure> cash, and another <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">$500</measure> when you strike the oil in sufficient quantity to work it, and then <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of the oil delivered <hi rend="italics">in barrels</hi> at the wells to the company's agent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/> Having a good deal of land in this county.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>I determined, before leasing, to see whether the oil was confined to the <rs type="place">Burning Spring Valley</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>The point from which I write is about <placeName><distance reg="12miles">12 miles</distance> <offset>South</offset> of  <placeName reg="Burning Spring, Washington, Ohio" key="tgn,2208568">Burning Spring</placeName></placeName>, and here to-day I find a man boring with every prospect of success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>The indications here are very marked, and I have also seen them to-day <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure> above this point. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/> The elevation of the surface here is very little above that of Burning Spring; and on comparing the different strata through which the man boring here has traversed and that encountered at the &#x0022;wells,&#x0022; there is a singular agreement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>Leases can be had here for a song.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>I shall take <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> myself, I think, though I have land in the neighborhood very similar in character, and on which there are signs of oil. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/> This is a remarkably fine country, (forget I own any land in it, if you please,) and, like a great many individuals, is not appreciated from home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>The growth is most extraordinary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>The beach, <placeName reg="Lynn, Essex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2050042">Lynn</placeName>, poplar and oak are worth looking at. The lands are stiff, generally, and produce fine wheat and excellent grass, tobacco, corn, and, indeed, anything that can be produced in any other part of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>If the whistle of the locomotive were heard here to-morrow, in less than <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> this whole country would be entirely changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>Indeed, the <name>Legislature</name> should authorize a survey for this purpose, especially, if the promise of the oil wells should be realized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>Hundreds of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of hogsheads of oil will, I doubt not, be shipped from this section in less than <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure>. I should like to see Virginias sharing fully <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> in this wonderful production of our dear old State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>Let them come out. As yet they are greatly in the majority, (<num value="10">10</num> to <num value="1">1</num>,) but Northern enterprise will soon turn the scale, unless we bestir ourselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/> A word on the subject of politics, and I have done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>I have talked with almost everybody I have met, and there is but <num value="1">one</num> opinion--<hi rend="italics">no submission to <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> rule.</hi> They prefer peace, but stand ready to maintain their rights, either in or out of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>They there found <num value="18">eighteen</num> holes in the ground, which had been dug by the <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indians</rs> as hiding places, and as the wagon approached they were enabled to fire upon them without being themselves observed in the darkness of early night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>The unity of the <name>Conference</name> should be the concern of us all. To attain this we must go back to fundamentals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>Some propose to strike out everything on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>That is revolutionary The most you can do is to protest, and seek redress under the <rs>Constitution</rs>, if the action of the <orgName n="General Conference" type="misc">General Conference</orgName> be constitutional.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>If unconstitutional, however, that makes a difference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>There I take my stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>A doctrine is a declaration of belief touching the declarations of Scripture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>If this definition be correct, this is a doctrine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>It is declarative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>It is a doctrine of faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>You can't get round that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>The <orgName n="General Conference" type="misc">General Conference</orgName> has laid every slaveholder in the <rs type="place">Church</rs> under this threefold censure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>The men of the <orgName n="General Conference" type="misc">General Conference</orgName> were not children; they were great men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>But suppose the class leader of a probationer believes the doctrine of the New Chapter, and the probationer does not, can the leader recommend him?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="615"/>No. -- Hence he can't get in. The <orgName n="General Conference" type="misc">General Conference</orgName> has made a Church abolition in doctrine, and slaveholding in practice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>They have even opened the doors to slaveholding preachers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>(No <num value="1">one</num> responding, he proceeded.) -- In all countries the principles entering into a compact, are recognized as the life of the compact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>It is a ruling in the courts of civilization that a violation of a compact by a majority leaves the minority in possession of the principles, and the real organic body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>If this be not true, constitutions are paper and naught else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>Does the New Chapter bring in a new doctrine?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>Let us go to history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>In the early <orgName n="Methodist Church" type="church">Methodist Church</orgName> they tried to bring in emancipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>This was never in the old compact, you see. Hence the compact is violated; hence the act is revolutionary; hence the minority is left in possession of the principles of the compact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>and is left as <hi rend="italics">the <rs type="place">Church</rs>.</hi> I wish to illustrate a little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>On what right do we, as <rs n="Protestant" type="religion">Protestants</rs>, claim to be the <orgName n="God Church" type="church">Church of God</orgName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>Romanism, in the <num value="16" type="ordinal">sixteenth</num> century, was in the majority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>If, then, the revolutionary <orgName n="General Conference" type="misc">General Conference</orgName> be the <rs type="place">Church</rs>, then I say let us acknowledge <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName> as the <orgName n="God Church" type="church">Church of God</orgName>.
