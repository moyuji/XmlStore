<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> Contrary, no doubt, to what you might expect from your point of observation, our Army will, I presume, go into winter quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The rigors of the season furnish a severe argument against any forward movements just at present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>I am afraid that our policy is too severely defensive, both here and upon the line of the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName>'s plan to merely repel invasion I have regarded as the correct <num value="1">one</num>, if not carried to that extreme that would seem to grant the enemy a too conscious immunity and security from all intrusion on our part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>But occasion has arrived, I think, for change in this policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Heretofore we had to cope with the <rs>Federals</rs> at such disadvantages that it would have been the height of impolicy to have provoked them by invasion; but now that our resources are sufficient to make us respectable contestants, the attempt of the enemy to divert our forces should be counteracted by our diverting theirs, by resorting to the very means they use to divert ours, namely, invasion, or at all events some demonstration of active hostility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The threatening advance of <persName n="Price,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Price,nomatch:0"><surname>Price</surname></persName> and <persName n="McCulloch,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:McCulloch,nomatch:0"><surname>McCulloch</surname></persName> against <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName>, for illustration, has in some measure already demonstrated that the policy of attack would greatly relieve <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The present inert policy is certainly opening the door of invasion very wide to the enemy, without affording any advantage to ourselves, whereas by invading their territory, or even attacking their lines, we would draw their armies back from our soil to defend their own. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> My opinion is, that the enemy regard this as too important a point, and have expended too much money in gun-boats and <orgName n="Floating Battery" type="battery">floating batteries</orgName> for the express purpose of taking <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName>, to long defer the attack in carrying out their favorite plan of descending the <rs>Mississippi</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>They say they must have it, and we are all the time adding to the strength and nature of its defences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Reinforcements are arriving daily, and we now have sufficient force here, I think, to repulse the enemy, no matter in what number. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> I do not expect another engagement, unless a naval <num value="1">one</num> entirely, before next week, as the roads are now too moist for the enemy's artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> gun-boats, I think, may be expected at any moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>I have barely time before the mail closes to narrate an anecdote too good to be lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>He applied to the medical purveyor to know why he had not supplied the army with this <hi rend="italics">Spir.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>vini. Gal.,</hi> and why so many requisitions had to be made for the article.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/><q>&#x0022;Well, I'll be d &mdash; d,&#x0022;</q> said the purveyor, <q>&#x0022;I've just found out how so much liquor has been finding its way into our army; it is upon your signing requisitions for <rs n="french brandy" type="product">French brandy</rs>;&#x0022;</q> and the doctor had his laugh heartily at the cruel expense of the <rs>General</rs>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> A most brutal prize fight took place at daybreak this morning, a short distance back of <placeName reg="Calvary Cemetery">Calvary Cemetery</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The principals &mdash; <persName n="Dorcy,,Mike,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="default:Dorcy,Mike,,,"><foreName>Mike</foreName> <surname>Dorcy</surname></persName> and <persName n="Holloway,,Edward,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="default:Holloway,Edward,,,"><foreName n="Edward">Ed.</foreName> <surname>Holloway</surname></persName> &mdash; have been in training for the past <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure>, and were in pretty good condition for the fight. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> The match was made up at a well-known sporting house up town in New York, and the principals, seconds, and about <num value="75">seventy-five</num> or a <num value="100">hundred</num> spectators crossed the <rs>Fulton</rs>, South, and <address><street n="Grand street">Grand street</street></address> ferries about <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time> this morning, and proceeded quietly to the ground selected. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> The preliminaries, such as the fixing of the ring, the choosing of bottle-holders, time-keeper, &#x0026;c., were soon settled, and the parties, both confident of victory, were brought in the ring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>They were light weights, and about <num value="19">nineteen</num> or <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> old. Hollo way, on coming into the ring, walked up to his opponent and offered to bet him <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">five dollars</measure> that he would win the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Dorcy replied that he had no money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>They then shook hands and the fight commenced. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> The betting at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> was even, but after a few rounds had been fought, the odds were in favor of Dorcy, upon whom the blows appeared to have little or no effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>From the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to the <num value="12" type="ordinal">twelfth</num> round both fought very shy, doing more sparring than fighting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/><persName n="Holloway,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="nearbymention:Holloway,Edward,,,"><surname>Holloway</surname></persName> by this time began to show the effect of Dorcy's &#x0022;mawlies,&#x0022; as he had received a bad cut upon the mouth and another upon the nose, from which the blood trickled down upon his breast. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> <hi rend="italics"><num value="13" type="ordinal">Thirteenth</num> round.</hi>--Both came to the scratch upon the call of time, and after sparring a minute closed, when, after pummelling each other about the head, <persName n="Holloway,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="nearbymention:Holloway,Edward,,,"><surname>Holloway</surname></persName> dropped upon his knee to save himself from further punishment.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>They then closed, and both fell together. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>But the report had since quieted down, and it was stated on pretty good authority that the <rs>President</rs> had abandoned the idea of this appointment, if he had ever entertained it. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>No <num value="1">one</num> of them has achieved so much renown with means such as he had.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>Especially is this the case in the <rs>West</rs>, and the temper of the public sentiment there upon the rumor that he was to be superseded was altogether unmistakable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/> It is understood that there was some rivalry and discord between <persName n="Price,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00091" reg="mostcommon:Price,nomatch:0"><surname>Price</surname></persName> and <persName n="McCulloch,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00092" reg="mostcommon:McCulloch,nomatch:0"><surname>McCulloch</surname></persName>, and that it was deemed the best way to quiet their troubles to appoint an officer superior to them both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>But even in adopting that course it is generally contended that the reelection of an old and distinguished General would have saved both the rival <rs>Generals</rs> somewhat of that mortification that would be inflicted by placing over them a young officer not yet greatly experienced, however accomplished he might be. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>He is a man of true courage and honor; and it is in no unkind spirit to him, evidently, that public sentiment has been so average to his superseding or ranking the brave and successful <persName n="Price,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00094" reg="mostcommon:Price,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Price</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>The regret has been to be forced to object to the appointment of an officer against whom so little could be said &mdash; indeed <num value="1">one</num> so much respected wherever he was known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>The regret was that so promising an officer should, upon his promotion to so high a position, be forced to incur a sort of public aversion for superseding the man, at this time <num value="1">one</num> of the greatest of the public favorites. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/> The rumor that this appointment is to be made is again circulated on the streets, with what truth we are unable to say.
