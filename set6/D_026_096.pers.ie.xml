<head>The grumblers.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/> Wheel-horses are invaluable in their true office, which is to hold back the wagon and prevent it from going down hill toe rapidly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>But, then, wheel-horses to hold back when the wagon is <hi rend="italics">going up hill,</hi> and when it is just at a &#x0022;pinch,&#x0022; requiring the whole strength of the team, are very unprofitable &mdash; nay, troublesome and vexations &mdash; animals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>They fatigue and weary the team, and retard the movement of the wagon, with advantage to none.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>The grumblers in the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> are just like these latter kind of wheel-horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>They take the studs as the heavy burthen is mounting the steepest part of the hill, and do every contrariwise thing known to horse kind, even to marring the good appearance of the &#x0022;single tree.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/> Now, as it is perfectly useless to reason with a &#x0022;bulky horse,&#x0022; it is idle to reason with the grumblers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>We can only hope to see the heavy wain taken to the top of the hill without them, knowing that they will not be pacified until the level, hard road is reached, and there they will in the sunshine and the shade of the lovely highway be as bright and cheerful as the best of horses, and sport their satisfaction and pride just as though they did as much as the freest puller and gamest horse in the team! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/> The grumbler is a very much injured man at <num value="1">one</num> time; he is a very intrepid defender of the people's rights at another; he is always a very independent fellow, not afraid to attack tyranny or corruption wherever they show their hideous fronts; and, we should add, never is anything but an honest and personally a most disinterested man!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>He is beyond question, the wisest of the wise, and sees what other people cannot; that <unclear>shing</unclear> is proper or politic, and no measure <unclear></unclear> the <rs>Government</rs> is constitutional.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>The suspension of the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus,</hi> although expressly authorized by the <rs>Constitution</rs>, is not done constitutionally, unless <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> done exactly in the manner the grumblers approve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>There must be an accuser, and a proceeding according to those very legal forms which it is the purpose of the suspension of the writ to avoid &mdash; the extraordinary exigency of the public service demanding the most summary process of military law. So bitter are they against the <hi rend="italics">manner</hi> of the suspension, we may inter that were the constituted authorities to avail themselves of the powers conferred they would take fire at once, and communicate the flames to the whole nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>The dramatic effect of their crusade against the monstrous invasion of popular rights would be so much heightened by a case, that it may not be unjust to suspect that they would he rather rejoiced over <num value="1">one</num>--not for any self-complacent sentiment of their's, but only to stand up for the people and the <rs>Constitution</rs>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>They will likely abuse him for not doing so. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/> Whether it be this <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus,</hi> or the conscript act, or the anti substitute law--[on this, however, they are rather subdued since the people and the army are not damaged by it, and rather favor it,]--the law for funding the currency &mdash; of the tax law &mdash; they are all violations of the constitution, assaults upon the liberally and the most sacred rights of the citizen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>They declare that they are not to be intimidated, not they!--that unconstitutional acts shall not go unannounced, and above all, they mean not to submit to any master!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>It might be charitably supposed that in that part of their speeches in which they renounce all masters, they in a moment of excitement or confusion, by mistake, get mixed up with their speeches on Southern affairs, a passage or <num value="2">two</num> formerly prepared for a philippic against <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00242" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>Either this, or the being betrayed into a thundering sentence, asserting personal independence, in which they have no idea of sacrificing sound and fury to such contemptible things as sense and reason, can only account for these outbursts from some Southern men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/> It is difficult to imagine what these people mean, unless it be merely to cut a caper, and by contrast prove their independence by side of other people's passiveness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>The country is beset on every side by the most powerful as well as the most heartless enemy that could be arrayed against it. The triumph of that enemy would be the death knell of every vestige of liberty in the <rs>South</rs>--the <rs>Southern</rs> people would be degraded beneath their very slaves &mdash; and no <num value="1">one</num> of the catalogue of miseries and mortifications but would be meted out to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>The entire strength of the country &mdash; in men and means &mdash; is demanded to avert these indescribable an immeasurable calamities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>And yet when the representatives of the <name>States</name>, after patient deliberation, decide upon the measures indispensable to the national defence, not <num value="1">one</num> of them meets the approval of these gentlemen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>All of them are pronounced unconstitutional!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>They affect to feel the chains gradually winding about their limbs and they kick! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/> Now let us ask &mdash; in the name of all that is rational and patriotic &mdash; what would these men do for the country's defence in this hour of imminent merit?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>How would they raise up men?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>How munitions of war?--How money?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>How many and how much would they give?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>Do they dream that volunteering in any way would be adequate either in men or means to the public defence against the <num value="1000000">millions</num> of men that are burled against the country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>Do they believe that by quietly and passively sending forward the olive branch of peace at the head of a few feeble brigades of volunteers, the enemy will grant us peace and <hi rend="italics">independence</hi> They cannot labor under any such vain delusion!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>It is impossible!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>There is not a men out of Bedlam so insane as to imagine any such thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>Then what do they mean, and what do they want? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/> But the country, after all, need care very little about these unaccountable demonstrations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>They have their temporary and limited effects, and there is an end of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>bet us not impugn too far the patriotism of these citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>The most of them are very sound; some of them would be consoled in their dark apprehensions for liberty by a Major (or some other) Generalship, or a foreign commission, or secretaryship &mdash; some are on a false scent, thinking they are running with the people, when they are taking the very opposite course &mdash; and some are unworthy of being associated with even the worst of these; they are uninfluenced by a single motive entitled to respect or charity; but are justly objects of both distrust and contempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>It is upon these last that rests the blood of many an honest and well meaning Confederate soldier, who permitted himself to be misled by them, and who repented of his error when too late. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/> The country is united as never country was in such a war. The feeble sounds of discord are drowned by the concordant voice of the entire people composing the family of <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>The successes achieved by a noble and intrepid soldiery are shaming the despondent and the timid into high spirit and courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>Croaking and grumbling are subsiding, and when the work is done, the acclivity reached, and the triumph won, there will be none to admit but they too were true and faithful, and helped to achieve the grand result! </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
