<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>It will never do to let the enemy turn our right and get possession of our depot at <placeName reg="Chickamauga, Walker, Georgia" key="tgn,7013598">Chickamauga</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>The demonstration to-day was intended, doubtless, to force him to make his election between the <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>If he decide to hold <placeName reg="Chickamauga, Walker, Georgia" key="tgn,7013598">Chickamauga</placeName> then he must yield the mountain, and throw his army between the enemy's encroaching <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName> and the railroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>If he give the preference to Lookout then the railroad and his depot of supplies must go. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>The natural effect of the affair to-day as has already been intimated, will be to force <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00073" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName> to weaken his left in order to strengthen his <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName>, now threatened by a formidable and largely superior force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>This, I doubt not, was <num value="1">one</num> of the objects of the demonstration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>I look, therefore, for an assault upon Lookout to-morrow, when it will be less able to resist an attack than it was to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>Our artillery on the mountain will be of no assistance after the enemy shall have reached the foot of the mountain, it being impossible to depress the guns sufficiently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>The importance of the mountain ceased with the loss of <placeName reg="Lookout Valley, Buffalo, Wisconsin" key="tgn,2469816">Lookout Valley</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>The possession of the valley reduces the wagon transportation of the enemy to <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> at farthest, and gives him the use of the river besides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/> Well, the enemy has assaulted <placeName reg="Lookout Mountain, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100143">Lookout Mountain</placeName> to-day sure enough, as was intimated in my letter of last night he probably would do. Having <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> accomplished a part of the object of his demonstration yesterday &mdash; to wit: the transfer of a portion of our forces on the mountain to the extreme right, he attacked the mountain with a confidence which the sequel will show was not misplaced.--The great rise in the <rs>Tennessee</rs> had carried away his pontoon bridges the night before, but his positions were so well taken, and had been so strongly fortified, that he did not hesitate to make the assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>He opened at <time value="11oclock">11 o'clock</time> with his batteries in <placeName reg="Lookout Valley, Buffalo, Wisconsin" key="tgn,2469816">Lookout Valley</placeName>, directing his fire against our lines along the western side and northern face of the mountain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>Our own batteries on the mountain could take no part in the engagement, owing to a dense fog which enveloped <placeName key="possibilities=46" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Lookout Point</placeName> and the crest above.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>At <time value="12:30">half-past 12</time> the <rs>Infantry</rs> became engaged, and the battle was then fully joined. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/> Very few details have been received &mdash; too few, indeed, for me to attempt to enter into particulars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>The impression prevails in well-informed circles that the affair has not been well conducted by the <rs>Confederate</rs> officers in command on the mountain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>Our forces had been much weakened the night before by the withdrawal of <orgName n="division"><persName n="Walker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00074" reg="mostcommon:Walker,nomatch:0"><surname>Walker</surname></persName>'s division</orgName>, which was sent to the right, leaving only <placeName key="tgn,2005379" n="1.000 91" reg="stevenson, jackson, alabama">Stevenson</placeName>'s and <orgName n="divisions"><persName n="Cheatham,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00075" reg="mostcommon:Cheatham,nomatch:0"><surname>Cheatham</surname></persName>'s divisions</orgName> behind, both under command of <persName n="Stevenson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00076" reg="mostcommon:Stevenson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Stevenson</surname></persName>. <persName n="Cheatham,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00077" reg="mostcommon:Cheatham,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Cheatham</surname></persName> arrived on the ground late in the afternoon, having just returned to the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>Up to the time of his return his division was under the command of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00078" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, the <rs type="role" reg="senior-Brigadier">senior brigadier</rs> in the division.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>It was thought that these <num value="2">two</num> divisions would have been sufficient to hold the position against a largely-superior force; but not so. The Confederates were steadily pushed back from the moment the infantry opened fire until late in the evening, when <persName n="Breckinridge,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00079" reg="mostcommon:Breckinridge,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Breckinridge</surname></persName> went to the assistance of <persName n="Stevenson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00080" reg="mostcommon:Stevenson,nomatch:0"><surname>Stevenson</surname></persName> with a brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>The Federal, who had driven the <rs>Confederates</rs> slowly around the north face of the mountain to <placeName reg="Craven's house">Craven's house</placeName>, and thence around almost to the road which leads to the top, were, in their turn, forced back after night some <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="500yards" type="distance">five hundred yards</measure>. The fight continued until <time value="10pm">10 P. M.</time>, and even now I can hear an occasional shot while I write. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/> The troops and guns on the mountain were brought down safely, only a few commissary stores being left behind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>We lost a considerable number of prisoners, nevertheless, early in the day and on the western slope of the mountain, the enemy, it is alleged, having got in the rear of <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Walthall,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00081" reg="mostcommon:Walthall,nomatch:0"><surname>Walthall</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> under cover of the prevailing fog. <num value="1">One</num> account says that <persName n="Walthall,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00082" reg="mostcommon:Walthall,nomatch:0"><surname>Walthall</surname></persName> lost from <num value="500">500</num> to <measure n="600" type="prisoners">600 prisoners</measure>, including nearly the whole of <num value="1">one</num> regiment, the <orgName type="regiment" key="MS34">34th Mississippi</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>It is not improbable that our loss has been exaggerated somewhat. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/> Orders have been given to evacuate the mountain and for the whole army to retire across the <rs>Chickamauga</rs>, in the direction of the station of that name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>The loss of <placeName reg="Lookout Valley, Buffalo, Wisconsin" key="tgn,2469816">Lookout Valley</placeName> and <placeName reg="Brown's Ferry">Brown's Ferry</placeName> removed all doubt as to the ability of <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00083" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen'l</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> to subsist his army at <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> this winter, and rendered the longer possession of <placeName reg="Lookout Mountain, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100143">Lookout Mountain</placeName> of comparatively little importance, and now that the mountain has passed into his hands there is no reason left why we should longer remain in the mud and water around <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>Besides <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00084" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> has been throwing a heavy force up the river and crossing it over in the boats we neglected to burn all this afternoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>A portion of this force consists of cavalry, which have been landed above the mouth of the <placeName reg="Chickamauga river">Chickamauga</placeName>.--Some infantry have also been landed on the east side of that stream &mdash; the remainder and much the more numerous body on the west side &mdash; all up the <rs>Tennessee</rs> and some distance above our <orgName n="Right Wing" type="wing">right wing</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>This movement greatly endangers the depot and railroad, and furnishes an additional reason for withdrawing across the <rs>Chickamauga</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>Another danger, and a still more serious <num value="1">one</num>, is the probability that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00085" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> will turn our right and get between the main army and <persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00086" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>It is now well ascertained that <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00087" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> has not gone to the relief of <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00088" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>, as was fully believed a few days ago; but the whole Federal army is here marshalling for our destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>Perhaps <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00089" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> has concluded that he could best succor <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00090" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> by forcing <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00091" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName> to retire. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>Officers from that quarter who were in this city <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> ago made no secret, so we learn, of the fact that it was <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00231" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName>'s intention to fall back on <placeName reg="Chickamauga, Walker, Georgia" key="tgn,7013598">Chickamauga</placeName>, and that he had even before they left camp commenced he contemplated retrograde movement, by sending all the heavy baggage, &#x0026;c., to the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>The reason assigned is very simple, and very natural.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/><persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00232" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName> wished to be nearer his depots of supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>In his then position he was compelled to haul all his commissary and quartermaster stores from <num value="7">seven</num> to <measure n="9miles" type="distance">nine miles</measure>, over roads already rendered nearly impassable by the continual passage of heavy trains over them, and in a fair way to become absolutely so as soon as the inevitable mud began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>Moreover, he was desirous to concentrate his forces, which were widely dispersed, and therefore continually exposed to attack in detail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>It appears evident that he was in the act of executing this movement in retreat when he was attacked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>It was comparatively easy for the enemy to gain possession of <placeName reg="Lookout Mountain, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100143">Lookout Mountain</placeName> after so large a portion of the force which originally held it had been withdrawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>The impression prevailed the other day that the centre had been routed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/> This dispirited our people more than anything else, for our troops had never before been routed in fair fight, although they had been sometimes compelled to retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>It turns out, however, that it was only the &#x0022;left centre&#x0022; (that is, the extreme left of the centre) that had been routed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>This makes a very great difference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>The centre, we understand, extended its left into a valley, between <num value="2">two</num> mountains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>The left of the centre, which was very feeble, was attacked by an overwhelming force, the design being to rout it, and turn the heights on which the rest of the centre was placed, thus compelling it to fall back, or surrounding it if it stood firm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>It had already commenced falling back before its extreme left was beaten, and the whole line kept pace with the retrograde movement, thus preventing the enemy from deriving the expected advantage from the interposition of heavy columns between the <num value="2">two</num> wings of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>The knowledge of this fact with regard to the left centre is calculated to remove much of the despondency which arose out of the belief that our centre had sustained a sort of <placeName reg="Waterloo, Lauderdale, Alabama" key="tgn,2005702">Waterloo</placeName> rout. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/> It is easy to conjecture, from an inspection of the map, why <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00233" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName> has chosen his present position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>His right apparently rests upon <placeName reg="Chickamauga, Walker, Georgia" key="tgn,7013598">Chickamauga</placeName>, covering the <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName> and <orgName n="Georgia Railroad" type="railroad">Georgia railroad</orgName>, and a branch which connects <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> with <persName n="Dalton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00234" reg="mostcommon:Dalton,nomatch:0"><surname>Dalton</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/> The rainy season seems to have set in very decidedly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>If all things turn out as they usually do, we shall have very little more campaigning until <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> next.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>The mud is the only ally we have, and it is a most formidable <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> evidently dread it, and the certainty of its near advent was <num value="1">one</num> of the causes why their newspapers urged a general advance so furiously a few weeks since.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>To prevent this catastrophe, the forward movement was ordered by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>We think, however, that, with the assistance of the mud, we can keep the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> from penetrating very far into <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> before the next spring at least.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>In the meantime, if the interval be wisely employed, the game may be turned in our favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>Starving, freezing, and every description of brutality, are employed to destroy the gallant men whom the fortune of war has thrown into their hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>These unhappy victims of devilish hate are thus punished, not for invading another country, but for defending their own homes and firesides from an internal invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>Yet the monsters who perpetrate these unheard of crimes have the shameless impudence to shed crocodile tears over the imagined suffering of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisoners in our hands, hoping thereby to divert the attention of the world from their own horrid cruelties, and to furnish a pretext for new atrocities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>If what they allege were true, it would be no more than invaders have a right to expect, nor half as much as the hideous oppressors of our own unfortunate captives deserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>If the black flag had been hoisted at the beginning, and for every innocent Southern life sacrificed in this war the lives of <num value="10">ten</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had been taken, it would have been an inadequate requital of their just deserts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>But no <num value="1">one</num> knows better than these unprincipled savages that their stories of starvation and cruelty in Southern prisons are as false as their own false and perfidious natures, and that any inconveniences or privations they may suffer is all the fault of the arch-fiend <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00239" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, who refuses to agree to a fair exchange of prisoners. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/> Our own soldiers should recollect on every battle field the treatment their brave comrades are receiving in those hells upon earth, the prisons of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>There is no other way of punishing the wretches who commit such crimes, no other method of retaliation, no other way of escaping themselves from the fate of their brethren, than by making every battle a battle to the death, by preferring to lie down and die rather than go to a Northern prison, and by sacrificing till their arms are wearied with slaughter, as many victims to the manes of their countrymen, starved, sickened, and frozen to death in Northern prisons, as powder and bayonet can reach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>We have long enough fought these ruffians and bloodhounds upon the principles of knightly and courteous warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>They do not understand it; they interpret it into fear; they have no comprehension of anything but the treatment of dogs, and the treatment of dogs let them have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/>Strike, soldiers of the <rs>South</rs>, strike your mightiest blows for the wrongs of your imprisoned comrades, and for your own deliverance. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/>
