<head>The women of the <rs>South</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> Nothing can be more noble and heroic than the spirit of the women of the <rs>South</rs> from the beginning of this contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>In their brave and generous hearts the flame of patriotism has burned from the beginning with a flame which no cloud of disappointment can dim nor floods of disaster extinguish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>In the language ascribed to a noble Southern lady, who, hearing of our resent reverence, expressed calmly, but with profound emphasis, her desire to be crushed to death by <num value="1">one</num> of the enemy's bomb-shells rather than witness the subjugation of the <rs>South</rs>, we believe that the women of the <rs>South</rs> would rather die to-morrow than witness the degradation of their native land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>To talk of subjugating a people whose another, wives and daughters are aminated by such a spirit is the wildest insanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>We have always regarded the enthusiastic and constant devotion of the <rs>Southern</rs> women to the <rs>Southern</rs> cause as a signal proof of the goodness of that cause, and of the moral strength it would command among the <rs>Southern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Virtuous unselfish, disinterested, their prayers will be stronger with Heaven than the arms of man, whose patriotism is too often mixed with the alloy of selfishness and ambition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Whilst the <rs>South</rs> has such women, her sons must be as brave as their mothers are pure and noble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> bless the women of the <rs>South</rs>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The cause is in their hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>And no matter how selfishness, greed, ambition, and inhumanity, may run riot elsewhere, no matter how men in petticoats may quail, and ravens may croak, the prayers of the mothers and wives of <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName> will avail with Heaven, and their spirits inspire the souls and nerve the arms of our people to <q>&#x0022;fight on, fight ever,&#x0022;</q> till their liberties are secured. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Both of them would have gladly raised the blockade but for the opposition of the <rs>British Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The interests of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> in <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> affairs are of a very complicated character, but she much mistakes her permanent welfare if she permits the golden opportunity for intervention in <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> affairs to pass unimproved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>If she saves the debts due her subjects in the <rs>North</rs>, she loses, in the event of Southern overthrow, the cotton of the <rs>South</rs> now and forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>That which is on band will be burned to the fast bale, and all planters, who prefer patriotism to pelf, will never hereafter raise another pound till their country is free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The idea that we shall be made to cultivate our lands for the benefit of those who make open war upon us, or who leave us coldly to our fate, is <num value="1">one</num> that hardly enters into the ideas of the high souled people of the <rs>South</rs>. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/> There is no disaster of the present war which it is so difficult to bear with any degree of patience or philosophy as the almost uniform success of the enemy's gunboats over our land batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>It is thing absolutely unprecedented its extent in the history of warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>In <measure n="9cases" type="mass">nine cases</measure> out of every <num value="10">ten</num> which have ever occurred before, land fortifications have given off vessels as often as they attacked them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>In the <rs>Russian</rs> war the immense steam navies of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> were beaten by the <rs>Russian</rs> fortifications in almost every encounter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>At <placeName reg="Pensacola, Escambia, Florida" key="tgn,7013972">Pensacola</placeName> the gallant <rs>Bragg</rs> gave some of the finest ships in the enemy a navy a lesson which has taught them ever since to keep their distance, but <unclear>el</unclear> that is the only instance in this war in which a powerful fleet of the enemy has been foiled in its purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>The reason is, that <orgName n="batteries"><persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00128" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName>'s batteries</orgName> were properly constructed and not mere slaughter pear, good for nothing but to invite a murderous and successful assault. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/> Nothing is easier than to defend such a river as the <rs>James</rs> from the incursions of an enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>It is in many places so narrow and tortuous that it would seem scarcely to require any artificial defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>But the recent raid of the enemy to a point so far in the interior as <placeName reg="Florence, Florence, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013766">Florence</placeName>, <persName><foreName>Ala</foreName></persName>, shows that their enterprise sometimes outruns their discretion, and that it is not safe to leave any water communication, however apparently secure, without proper defences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>We are aware that measures have been long ago taken to certify certain pouts on the <placeName key="tgn,7013964;tgn,1125114" n="0.362 000000.7231	placename;tgn,7013964;Richmond, Richmond, Virginia,Richmond,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;0.362 000000.7231	placename;tgn,1125114;James River, Virginia, Virginia,Virginia,United States,North and Central America" reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia,Richmond,Virginia,United States,North and Central America;James River, Virginia, Virginia,Virginia,United States,North and Central America">James river</placeName>, though to what extent we would not mention if we knew, and the <rs>Government</rs> conducts all its military operations with such commendable secrecy that we do not ourselves know the number nor the location of the defences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>But there can be no harm in recommending that they be multiplied and strengthened, and that obstructions be placed at such points in the channel as may be meet efficient in stopping the progress of a hostile fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>For this purpose piles might be driven in the river, vessels sunk, and preparations made for blasting up sandstone bluff that overhang the channel at certain points, and which could be readily precipitated into the river upon the approach of an enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>With such appliances for defence, added to strong fortifications, and the protection afforded by the powerful force of <persName n="Magruder,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00129" reg="mostcommon:Magruder,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Magruder</surname></persName> on the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>, the apprehensions so rife in the community of an incursion by this mode of approach to the capitals, ought to be readily allayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>We speak with entire candor when we say that we know nothing of the extent and character of the fortifications on the river, but take it for granted that after the long period affording opportunities for making it absolutely impregnable which has clapsed, it ought to be in such a state as to ensure public confidence in its security. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/> But it is not with reference to fortifications in any particular locality, but in all, that we would again, and for the <num value="100" type="ordinal">hundredth</num> time, urge the construction of works capable in every respect of resisting the heavy weight of metal east by the powerful guns new in use in naval warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>There is no reason on earth why our fortifications should not only be invulnerable by gunboats, but they should be able to beat them badly in every content.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>Nothing but the most culpable negligence in their construction of the management of their guns can admit of any other result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>Our authorities should see to this matter at once, and have the fortifications either built properly, or not built at all. Return not contract them at all, than construct them for the butchery of our man and the glory of the enemy. </p> </div3>
