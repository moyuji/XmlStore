A <rs n="General Order" type="misc">general order</rs>, issued yesterday, bears unrelentingly upon deserters and upon officers absent without leave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>The latter will find it healthy for their official constitutions to report at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>The commander believes that proper vigilance upon the part of subordinate officers will prevent desertions, and the exercise of this vigilance will be required. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/> It is a matter of record that but <num value="1">one</num> man was ever executed in the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName> for a flagrant crime, and that was a case of an attempted desertion to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>There is another point upon which I believe <persName n="Hooker,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00071" reg="mostcommon:Hooker,Joe,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Hooker</surname></persName> means to make improvements, and in fact means to control entirely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>It is in the matter of promotions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>Being at the head of the army, he must necessarily know who he has beneath him, and upon whom he can rely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Faithful officers will be rewarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Men who fight bravely and do their whole duty will be placed literally in &#x0022;the line of promotion&#x0022; upon the commander's roster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>Faithfulness will not be comprehended in a mere machine like performance of duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Alacrity and earnest desire for success in their work are the requisites which entitle officers and men to consideration and approval. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/> Useless, inefficient, and incompetent officers will probably have a hard time of it. No subordinate who does not respond promptly to the wishes of his commander will be tolerated for an instant.--Any such desiring to get out of the service will have an opportunity to do so, and if not going voluntarily, they will go by disgraceful dismission.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/> It may not be in a Republic whose people are educated to the principle of personal independence that we shall ever have an army of soldiers, whose more discipline shall render them capable of being impressed and moulded by the force of <num value="1">one</num> powerful will, as <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00073" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> sometimes impressed and moulded his armies.

<head>The Crisis.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/> We have always been of that class who have endeavored to disabuse the popular mind, whenever it conceived any false hopes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>For this, we have sometimes been charged with discouraging our people, especially when we have told them plainly, and urged it upon them, that they had nothing to hope from foreign intervention, or from anything else save <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and their own right arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>Some people among us have been amazingly slow in discovering this patent fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>But we are glad to see that it begins now to be pretty generally admitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>The Ironsides at <placeName reg="Port Royal, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096511">Port Royal</placeName>, the immense fleet of transports, the huge army those transports carry, the tremendous preparations at <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, the heavy force of <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00255" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName>, the enormous <orgName>army of <persName n="Hooker,,Joe,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00256" reg="default:Hooker,Joe,,,"><foreName>Joe</foreName> <surname>Hooker</surname></persName></orgName>, are &#x0022;fixed facts&#x0022; which cannot be overlocked or gainsayed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>The near approach of a tremendous struggle is evident to everybody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>Recognition is no longer thought of; even the most sanguine give it up in dispair, as they ought to have done a year ago. The encouragement of the hope that it was coming, that it would be followed by intervention, and that intervention would put an end to the war, has done mischief enough already.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>We hope it will not be allowed to do any more. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/> It is probable enough that in the multiplicity of attacks about to be made upon us, some of them may prove successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>But unless <hi rend="italics">all</hi> succeed our cause is still as hopeful as ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>The invasion has been compared to the operations of an anaconda in the act of stifling his victim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>It is a good simile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>Wound the anaconda in any part of his body and you break his hold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>Defeat any part of this expedition and you destroy the whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>Suppose the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> should burn <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> and <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/> Let our people, then, be of good cheer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>The &#x0022;anaconda&#x0022; must succeed everywhere if it expects to accomplish anything worth fighting for. Partial success will not do. And even if they should succeed everywhere; if they should take <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>, <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, still we are not beaten as long as men survive to bear the banner of the red cross in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>We cannot afford to be beaten.
