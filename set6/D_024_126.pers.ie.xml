<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>It is, no doubt, forced to this by popular feeling as well as the sentiment of the press.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> could not withhold its disapproval of such a high-handed exercise of power, when even the <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi> and the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Evening Post" type="newspaper">Evening Post</orgName>, </hi> negro-worshipping <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republicans</rs>, declared their opinions decidedly in opposition to it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The Northern elections of last autumn involved a serious warning from the loyal States against these arbitrary arrests &mdash; a warning which, it was hoped, had put an end to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Under this conviction the people of the several States concerned in our spring elections rose up to sustain the <name>Administration</name> and the war against all the peace clamors of the <name>Copperheads</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>If we could reason about a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> as we can about other men, we would say that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> would be compelled to &#x0022;quash&#x0022; the sentence, or to go on with his arrests, and to put in his bastilles not only the small men who made the excited speeches in <orgName n="New York City" type="newspaper">New York city</orgName> on the <dateStruct value="--19"><day reg="2">19th</day></dateStruct>, but <persName n="Seymour,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Seymour,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Seymour</surname></persName> and <persName n="Hunt,,Washington,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="default:Hunt,Washington,,,"><foreName>Washington</foreName> <surname>Hunt</surname></persName> and their brother sympathizers generally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>To keep him in prison and arrest no more men, would be but showing his own hesitation and fear of the consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Hesitation is dangerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>To keep <persName n="Vallandigham,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="nearbymention:Vallandigham,C.,L.,,"><surname>Vallandigham</surname></persName> in prison and arrest no more men, will only raise the storm of popular feeling higher, and may elect him <rs type="role" reg="Governor">Governor</rs> of <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, and then comes a troublesome issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>To go on consistently, with a high hand, like a true despot, as he desires to be, he must arrest all the leading sympathizers, and, if the people rise, put them down with the bayonet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>But would they rise?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Again, were they like other people, we could say that they would.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>But the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are so peculiar, and have so often disappointed all reasonable human expectations, that we would not hazard an opinion upon the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>We all must wait the issue of the present storm, whether it be a <rs n="tea pot" type="product">tea-pot</rs> tempest or not. </p> 
<div4 type="entry" n="1">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> Since the foregoing article was in type, (it having been deferred for some days.) news has been received that the <rs>Federal Dictator</rs> has commuted the sentence of <persName n="Vallandigham,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="nearbymention:Vallandigham,C.,L.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Vallandigham</surname></persName> to transportation through the lines of his military occupation to the <rs>South</rs>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The Dictator evidently falters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>He hopes to escape a possible issue with a part of the <rs>Northern</rs> people by exiling his victim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>But the subterfuge will not avail him if those who have taken action against his summary military proceedings are sincere and courageous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>His attempt to avoid an issue will, in that case, but the more strongly determine them to press it. The <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName> sees this, evidently; for it declares, in its date of the <num value="22" type="ordinal">22d</num>, that the modification of the penalty imposed on <persName n="Vallandigham,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="nearbymention:Vallandigham,C.,L.,,"><surname>Vallandigham</surname></persName> makes the crime of his arrest and trial &#x0022;a still greater crime.&#x0022; It proceeds; &#x0022;The Government has only aggravated its fault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>If it had a right to commute a punishment it had a right to inflict it, which is the point in dispute.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The tyrannical privileges assumed by <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> are reaffirmed by a variation of the sentence, which violates just as glaringly the constitutional rights of the citizen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>This is an aggravation instead of a palliation of the blunder already committed, and will tend to multiply the difficulties by which the <name>Administration</name> is already beset.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> Also, since the article above referred to was in type, we have the proceedings of another meeting in New York, whose resolves are bolder and more defiant than any yet adopted by Northern meetings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>They increase the embarrassments of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and press more decidedly upon him the necessity of carrying out his policy of military arrests for sedition, or of abandoning them altogether.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>He can neither quiet clamor by exiling <persName n="Vallandigham,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="nearbymention:Vallandigham,C.,L.,,"><surname>Vallandigham</surname></persName> nor intimidate sedition by simply refusing to liberate him. He must go ahead or back out. Each day is increasing the number of prominent men incurring the penalties of such an order as <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00030" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>'s. </p> </div4> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>We denounce this act, by whomsoever authorized or instigated, as a crime against the people of all the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>To resist aggression less odious, our revolutionary fathers, of every colony on the continent, made common cause, and we, men of New York, sympathizing with our brethren of other States subjected to such outrages, pledge &#x0022;our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honors.&#x0022; to stand by them to the last. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/> <hi rend="italics">Resolved,</hi> That the conduct of our foreign affairs by this administration has been a series of blunders; at times blustering and again timid; now pot-valiant, and then cowardly &mdash; it has at last placed us in a position where even <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> dares to bully us. While we deprecate and shall continue to oppose the prosecution of the civil war pending, we require and demand that the <name>Administration</name> shall submit to no more insults from <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>To resist that insolent power we pledge every man and every dollar required in a vigorous and successful effort to maintain the honor, the flag, and the interest of the country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/> <hi rend="italics">Resolved,</hi> That the paper lately issued at <placeName reg="Albany, Albany, New York" key="tgn,7013266">Albany</placeName>, purporting to be the address of the <rs>Democratic</rs> members of the <name>Legislature</name>, has no binding effect upon the <name>Democracy</name> of this city or vicinity, because our members, whose name were without authority attached to it, did not sign and do not concur in it, and because said paper advocates a continuance of the war under the policy of the <name>Administration</name> with all its objects, outrages, and unconstitutional purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>We call upon the members of this city to publicly disavow it, or we shall disavow them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/> <hi rend="italics">Resolved,</hi> That in view of this attempt at <placeName reg="Albany, Albany, New York" key="tgn,7013266">Albany</placeName> to place the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> of the <rs>State</rs> in a false position as favoring continuance of the war, we are glad to learn that the masses composing the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> will meet in <orgName n="State Convention" type="convention">State Convention</orgName> at an early day, to the end that they may express their own opinions upon this great question, independent of the selfish clique which has so long ruled and ruined the party organization of the <rs>Empire State</rs>. </p> </q><bibl n="Mr. James Brooks"></bibl></cit>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/> These resolutions were followed by a number of able speeches, denouncing the <name>Administration</name> in the most unmeasured terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>It is enough to give a sketch of the most prominent of them: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>He said there is not a despotism on the face of the earth where a man at least has not the right to express, his views in the cause of humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>But in this country a man who has lately occupied a high position as a member of Congress, a man of ability, education, and tried patriotism, for no cause in the world, except that, in a political meeting, he said to those that were around him, that we are engaged in a war which cannot result beneficially to us &mdash; for this, his house is forcibly entered by soldiers, and he is carried away and imprisoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>He is brought before a military tribunal. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/> Is not treason <unclear>de</unclear> by the statute?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>Is there any reason that the law should be trampled upon and entirely disregarded, as if they wished to show the people the power they have, and that they care not for the <rs>Constitution</rs> and laws?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>They commit an act of outrage and violence unparalleled in the history of this or any other civilized land since the bloody days of the <rs>French</rs> revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>[Applause.] Neither this Government nor the other can still the voice of the <num value="1000000">millions</num> of the people except they drown it in blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>These men were not seized and brought before a military tribunal for expressing that opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>It is true there was a peace party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>[Applause] If ever there was a time when we should call for a cessation of those sad experiments we have been making it is now. Some of these men who are opposed to this, if they could but hear the wails and weeping that go up all over this land; if they could understand, as they will understand by-and-by, that no benefit whatever is to result from this war; if they can understand that we may go on spending <num value="1000000">millions</num> of treasure, entailing upon our children a debt which will be fearful; and if they could understand that it must result in some arrangement or other at last, they would agree with us and say: <q>&#x0022; <hi rend="italics">For <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> sake let us sheath the sword and make a peace upon some terms or other, and stop this horrid war, which is a curse both to the <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>.</hi>&#x0022;</q> [Applause] </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>The doors of this man's house have been broken into by a lawless soldiery in the hour approaching morning, when man slumbers most heavily, cruelly alarming his wife and family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/> I have received the questions submitted upon the <rs>Election Laws</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/> Question <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num>--Can officers of the navy, who are citizens of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, of lawful age, vote in the approaching election, and where are they to vote? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/> Answer.--They are legal voters in the county or city of their residence, unless by reason of the presence of the enemy in the same they cannot there vote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>In such case they vote under the <orgName type="regiment" key="3Section">3d section</orgName> of the act of Assembly, passed <date value="1863-03-26">March 26, 1863,</date> and under ordinace <num value="99">No. 99</num>, section <num value="4">4</num>--that is, at the court-house of the county or city where they happen to be. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/> Question <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>.--Can sailors and mariners, who are citizens and of lawful age, vote, and where? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/> Answer.--Such persons are prohibited from voting by the terms of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>They are seamen and mariners in the regular service of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/> Question <num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num>.--Can officers and privates of the army, who have been paroled or exchanged, but who are not with their, regiments, battalions, or companies, vote, and where? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/> Answer &mdash; I do not think they can vote under the provisions of the act above named for voting in camps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>They must be qualified voters in a regiment, or in a company or battalion unattached, or in a company or battalion on detached service, in order to vote under the <orgName type="regiment" key="2Section">2d section</orgName> of the above-mentioned act. The men being on detached service, unless in a company or battalion on such service, will not bring them within the law. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/> But such officers and privates may vote, under the provisions of the act and the ordinance for the voting of absentees from counties or corporations, because of the presence of the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/> The difficulty, where such is the case, under this question, is, that there seems to be no provisions for holding the polls in such cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>There is no reason why suffrage should be denied to such officers and men, but no provision is made for receiving their votes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/> Question <num value="4">4</num>.--Can officers or privates of the army on furlough, who are not in their counties, vote; and who is to record their votes? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/> Answer.--I answer this as I answered the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>They can only vote as absentees under the <orgName type="regiment" key="3Section">3rd section</orgName> of the law, and the <orgName type="regiment" key="4Section">4th section</orgName> of the ordinance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/> Question <num value="5">5</num>--Have men, who are detailed for particular duties, and are absent from their resistance the right to vote, and where? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/> Answer.--They may vote if they are absentees from their residence by reason of the presence of the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/> I think they may vote, too, if they are in a company and under the command of some officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>If they are at a post, and there is a commander of the post, I should incline to think they might vote under his supervision, and within the limits of his post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>But where detailed to other duty, but not under command of some officer as a part of a corps for duty, I think there is no provision for their voting. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/> Question <num value="6">6</num>.--Can the commandants of peace at which are wounded soldiers in hospitals, or where there are Government employees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>(who are in the military service) hold polls at his post for such persons to vote? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/> Answer.--I think those on detached service at a post may vote there upon the detail of superintendent, &#x0026;c., by commandant of the post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>I doubt very much whether this will include invalids in hospitals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>They can hardly be said to be on detached service, nor have they any commandant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>If there be a commandant of the hospital, as a post, I think the vote might be taken. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/> It is very difficult to construc these provisions so as to meet all the cases which arise. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/> I may add that while on the <num value="1">one</num> hand the law does not give the right of suffrage beyond the constitutional provision, yet it enables those who possess it under the <rs>Constitution</rs> to exercise it, though absent by reason of military service or the presence of the enemy from their place of residence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>I am therefore inclined to give a liberal construction to the terms of the law, but am not willing to embrace cases which the terms of the law do not fully include, especially where the law has not clearly provided the means for the holding of the poll. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/> With this rule I have endeavored to steer clear of a strict construction on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, and a latitudinous interpretation on the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>I think it will reach all the practicable cases within the intention of the <name>Legislature</name>. </p> <closer> <salute>I am, very respectully,</salute> <lb/> Your obedient servant, <signed><persName n="Tucker,,J.,R.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00170" reg="default:Tucker,J.,R.,,"><foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName>  <surname>Tucker</surname></persName>.</signed> <lb/> <persName n="Letcher,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00171" reg="mostcommon:Letcher,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Letcher</surname></persName>, </closer> </div3> </div2> <milestone unit="column" n="7"/>
