<head>The capture of the <rs>Florida</rs>,</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/> as I said in my last letter, has caused no excitement here, in suite of the strenuous efforts of the unfriendly journals to falsify the circumstances in the case and to rouse the popular indignation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>There has been, however, a good deal of serious discussion on the subject, and I am compelled to say that, even among the warmest sympathizers with the <rs>North</rs>, there appears to be but <num value="1">one</num> conclusion, and that is, that the capture of the <rs>Florida</rs> was unwarrantable, and not to be justified under any circumstances. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/> At the same time, the impression is quite as general that the authorities at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> will, of their own accord, promptly disavow the act of the captain of the <rs>Wachusett</rs> and make the proper apology and reparation to the <rs>Government</rs>, of <placeName reg="Brazil, Clay, Indiana" key="tgn,2031163">Brazil</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>It is proper to say, however, that we have only the <rs>Southern</rs> version of the affair, and that too much dependence must not be placed on the unsupported testimony of the commander of the <rs>Florida</rs>, who will, of course, make the best of his tale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>You will have received what purports to be the official correspondence on the subject, and be in possession of all the facts before we are. We are anxious to learn what explanations are given by the captain of the <rs>Wachusett</rs> and by <persName n="Wilson,Consul,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00048" reg="mostcommon:Wilson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Consul">Consul</roleName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName>; but as the case now stands, the most patriotic of us here fear that there must be, on the part of the <rs>Washington Government</rs>, a repetition of the course pursued in the <rs>Trent</rs> affair. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="2"> 
<head>English Opinions of the case.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/> The language used by the <hi rend="italics">Star</hi> (about whose friendliness there can be no doubt) will show you exactly how the matter is regarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>That journal, after suggesting the absence of any Federal account of the affair, says as follows: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/> &#x0022;The circumstantial Confederate accounts have been so supplemented by the official correspondence of the <rs>Brazilian</rs> authorities, that there can be no doubt as to the main facts necessary for forming a judgment upon the occurrence.--That judgment can only be that a very gross violation of neutrality has been committed by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> cruiser, which we sincerely hope the <orgName n="U.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/> And again: &#x0022;We know nothing which could so raise the reputation of the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> among its friends in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> as a prompt offer of reparation to <placeName reg="Brazil, Clay, Indiana" key="tgn,2031163">Brazil</placeName> for this unquestionable and unpardonable outrage.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/> The last proverbial adjective in this latter quotation is probably not to be taken literally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>If the outrage, as it is termed, be unpardonable, there would be very little use in making any offer of reparation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>The quotation serves, however, to show that even our best friends resort to the strongest language in expressing their dissatisfaction with the act in question. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/> We have often taken occasion to declare &mdash; what, indeed, it was hardly necessary to declare &mdash; that we make no pretensions whatever to any knowledge of the art military.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>Some common sense, however, we do lay claim to; and under the influence of that useful, and by no means common gift, we do not hesitate to say that the expedition of <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00070" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> into <placeName key="tgn,7007248" n="1.000 6" reg="georgia">Georgia</placeName> is <num value="1">one</num> of the most ridiculous conceptions that ever entered into the mind of man. There was no object that he could possibly gain at all commensurate with the advantages he was certain to lose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>If <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00071" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> had cut off his supplies and interrupted his communications, he should have followed the <name>Napoleonic</name> injunction: <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, settle everything, if possible, in front, and then clear your communications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>He should have turned back upon <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00072" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName>, defeated and paralyzed his army, and <hi rend="italics">then</hi> returned to <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>But his egregious vanity had already committed so far that he knew not how to go back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>Blated by the retreat of <persName n="Johnston,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00073" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><surname>Johnston</surname></persName> &mdash; which was undoubtedly the result of profound calculation on the part of that great officer &mdash; and mistaking entirely the object of that retreat, he imagined that it was compulsory and had been produced by his own skilful combinations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>When he had succeeded in defeating <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00074" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Jonesboro, Clayton, Georgia" key="tgn,2023284">Jonesborough</placeName> &mdash; a defeat productive, absolutely, of not <num value="1">one</num> single advantage to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> cause &mdash; he grew mad with self-esteem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>He not only published the most extravagant and exaggerated accounts of what he had done, but actually proclaimed to the world that his campaign was a model for all military men to study in future &mdash; a piece of arrogance that would have been disgusting even in C&#x00E6;sar or <placeName reg="Napoleon, Henry, Ohio" key="tgn,2080924">Napoleon</placeName>, and which neither of these mighty generals thought of indulging in. After having gone so far &mdash; when <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00075" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> fell upon his rear and cut off his communications &mdash; shame forbade him to take the retrograde and to confess that his boasted conquests were no conquests at all. The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> mob would have tern down his statue from the pedestal and degraded him from the lofty elevation which his own falsehoods and their boundless credulity had assigned to him; and that was, to a mind so full of vanity and ostentation, worse than death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>He seems, therefore, to have resolved upon the expedition to <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> as a last desperate expedient to prove the just ground of all his previous vaporings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>He had said that the whole country he had passed over was completely subdued, and that there was no longer any danger in it. He had spoken contemptuously of <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00076" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> and his operations, and he now determined to show that he felt as he spoke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>Wounded vanity seems to have been at the bottom of all his proceedings. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/> What he expected to gain in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> we do not know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>We think it pretty certain, however, that he did not expect much opposition, and that he did expect to meet with much encouragement and assistance from the population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>We should infer thus much from his <rs n="General Order" type="misc">general order</rs> prescribing the rules to be observed in marching, and from his having determined to discard supply trains and trust to feeding on the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>In both these calculations he has been signally deceived, if all the accounts be true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>From the inhabitants, he has met with no assistance or co-operation whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>In every case in which it was possible, they have either fled at his approach or taken up arms against him. The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> newspapers heralded his advance by pompous anticipations of the mighty captures he was to make and the mighty effect his invasion was to produce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>It was to cut off the portions of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> whence, according to their accounts, <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00077" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> receives his supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>It was to flank <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00078" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> out of his position and deliver <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> over to <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00079" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>It was to recapture the <num value="40000">40,000</num> or <num value="50000">50,000</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisoners that they said were in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>It was to take <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName> and <placeName reg="Macon, Bibb, Georgia" key="tgn,7013980">Macon</placeName>, where, they said, were the main rebel powder mills and magazines of every kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>It was to take <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> and <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, and crush the rebellion by the capture of these rebellious strongholds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>If he designed any of these things, and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> journals gave him credit for designing them all, yet was disappointment more complete; and if he fancied, as the same papers seem to have done, that the population would receive him with joy and the <name>Legislature</name> rapturously hail his advent as the signal for restoring the <rs>Union</rs>, never was self-deception more deplorable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>We know not where he is.--His very friends have been firing guns by day, and sending up rockets by night, all along the coast for the last week, with the hope of discovering his where abouts, in vain, while <num value="2">two</num> exploring expeditions, sent forward for the same purpose, have been signally defeated and thrust back to their boats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>But we know, at least, that the important places the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> speak so confidently of his taking are far beyond his reach, and that he has something to think of very different from capturing great cities or important arsenals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>Should he ever succeed in reaching the shore &mdash; an event somewhat problematical just at this time &mdash; he can only get transportation to some seaport, whence he may transport his army back to <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, the point from which he <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> set out last spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>And who can tell what may have happened before he shall have reached his department once more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>His absence has already afforded <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00080" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName> a great opportunity, and he seems disposed to make the most of it. If the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> should gain another such victory as that of <persName n="Franklin,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00081" reg="mostcommon:Franklin,nomatch:0"><surname>Franklin</surname></persName>, <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName> will be ours, and <hi rend="italics"><num value="2">two</num></hi> more such will give us the whole of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">Middle</rs> Tennessee</placeName>. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
