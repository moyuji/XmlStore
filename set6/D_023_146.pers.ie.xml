<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>The following is an extract from a speech of <persName n="Stephens,the Honorable,A.,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="default:Stephens,A.,H.,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">Hon.</roleName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Stephens</surname></persName>, at <placeName reg="Crawfordville, Taliaferro, Georgia" key="tgn,2022590">Crawfordville, Ga.</placeName>, on the <unclear></unclear> inst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>It will set right the misunderstanding of the public of <persName n="Stephens,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Stephens,A.,H.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stephens</surname></persName>'s former remarks on the object of planting cotton: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> But, besides the products necessary to sustain ourselves to support our armies, and carry on war, we have another clement of tremendous power, if properly used and applied &mdash; a recourse and power known in <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> wars, and unknown to our ancestors in the war of their revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/><rs type="role">Mr.</rs> S. here said he alluded to our great staple, cotton; and he should not have said more upon it at this <unclear></unclear> than barely to ask those present to call to their minds what he had said to most of them last year upon that subject, when he addressed them upon the <rs>Cotton Loan</rs>, but for some misconceptions that have got in the public mind from a <unclear> para</unclear> report of some remarks he made at a meeting lately in <placeName reg="Sparta, White, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101606">Sparta</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Some, from that report, said <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> S., have taken the <name>Idea</name> that I urged upon the printers there to plant largely of cotton next year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Allow me, in this connection, to say that nothing should be further from the fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>I urged upon the planters there, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and above all, to grow grain and stock for home consumption and to supply the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>What I said at <placeName reg="Sparta, White, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101606">Sparta</placeName> upon the subject of cotton, many of you have often heard me say in private conversation, and most of you in the public speech last year, to which I alluded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Cotton, I have maintained, and do maintain, is <num value="1">one</num> of the greatest elements of power, if not the greatest, at our command, if it were but properly and effectually used, as it might be. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> <persName n="Jameson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Jameson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jameson</surname></persName>'s strength was in his locks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Our strength is in our locks &mdash; not of hair or wool, but in our looks of cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>I believed from the beginning that the enemy would inflict upon us more serious injury by the blockade than by all other means combined &mdash; It was, in the judgment of all, a matter of the utmost, if not vital importance to have it raised, removed, or broken up. How was it to be done?--That was, and is the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>It was thought by many that such was the demand for cotton in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> that she would disregard the blockade, as it was and has been all along, not within the terms of the <rs>Paris</rs> agreement &mdash; that is, has not been, at any time, entirely effectual, though close enough to do us great injury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>I did not concur in this opinion, as most of you well know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>I thought it would have to be done by ourselves, and could be done through the agency of cotton not as a political, but as a commercial and financial power.--I was in favor, as you know, of the <rs>Government</rs>'s taking all the cotton that would be subscribed for <num value="0.08">eight per cent</num> bonds at a rate or price as high as <measure n="10cents" type="currency">ten cents</measure> per pound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/><num value="2000000">Two millions</num> of bales of the last year's crop might have been counted upon as certain on this plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>This at <measure n="10cents" type="currency">ten cents</measure>, with bags of the average commercial weight, would have cost the <rs>Government</rs> <num value="100000000">one hundred millions</num> of bonds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>With this amount of cotton in hand as pledged any number, short of <num value="50">fifty</num>, of the best iron clad steamers could have been contracted for and built in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Steamers at the cost of <num value="2000000">two millions</num> each could be procured every way equal to the <rs>Monitor</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/><num value="30000000">Thirty millions</num> would have got <num value="15">fifteen</num> of these which might have been enough for our purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/><num value="5">Five</num> might have been ready by the <date value="01-01">first of January</date> last to open some <num value="1">one</num> of our ports blockaded on our coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/><num value="3">Three</num> of these could have been left to keep the port open, and <num value="2">two</num> could have conveyed the cotton across the water, if necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/><persName n="Thos,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Thos,nomatch:0"><surname>Thos</surname></persName>, the debt could have been promptly paid with cotton at a much higher price than it cost and a channel of trade kept open till others and as many more as necessary might have been built and paid for in the same way. At a cost of less than <num value="1">one</num> month's present expenditure on our army our coast might have been cleared. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> In this way cotton, as a great element of power at our command &mdash; such an element as no other people ever had &mdash; might have been used not only in breaking up the blockade by our own means, without the aid of foreign intervention, but in supplying the <name>Treasury</name> with specie to pay interest on their bonds, and thus keep up the credit of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The public credit is as essential as subsistence in war. Such at least was, and is my opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The Government, however, took a different view of the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Many thought it unconstitutional.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Some looked upon it as a <hi rend="italics">project</hi> to relieve the planters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Others thought it nothing short of a South Sea speculation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>I considered it then and now just as constitutional as to give bonds for gunpowder, or to buy other munitions of war. It is not with a view to relieve the planters, though its incidental accommodation to them would not have been objectionable; but with the view of wielding effectually the element of the greatest power we could command, that I wished this course adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>This resource, then; this element of power, we still have, though not to the same extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>There is enough, however, to effect wonderful results, if properly used, as it can be. We may have lost a year or <num value="2">two</num>, but we are far a hort of <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure> war yet. With our ports open many of the present evils and hardships of the war would be relieved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>We would no longer have to give <measure n="50dollars" type="currency">$50</measure> for a bushel of <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName> salt, or <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">ten dollars</measure> for the roughest sort of shoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>With ports open, and this staple in hand, we should be much better able to make it a <rs n="Peloponnesian" type="ethnic">Peloponnesian</rs> struggle, if our enemy choose so to make it. This view, and <num value="1">one</num> other idea, I presented to the people at Sparts, upon the subject of cotton, which I will repeat here. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> Many to be met with suppose that by abandoning the growth of cotton, and burning what we have, we can force our recognition abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>This I told the people there, and I tell you, is, in my judgment, a radical and fundamental error.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/><placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> will never be controlled by such a policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Our cotton should be treasured up as gold &mdash; more than gold &mdash; for it is more powerful as a sinew of war than gold is. Like gold and everything else of value, it should be destroyed, if need be, to prevent its falling into the hands of the enemy; but with no view to a foreign policy, nor should the production of cotton be abandoned with such a view.--You could not please <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Palmerston</foreName></persName> better than to let him know that there would not be grown a pound of cotton in the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> for <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure>. The power of cotton is well known to, and felt by, the <rs>British</rs> statesmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>They know it is king in its proper <unclear>here</unclear> and hence they want the sceptre of this king for their own use. The great error of those who suppose that <persName><roleName n="King">King</roleName> <foreName>Cotton</foreName></persName> would compel the <rs>English Ministry</rs> to recognize our Government and raise the blockade, and who still look for the same result from the total abandonment of its culture consists in mistaking the nature of the king dom of this potentate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>His power is commercial, not financial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>It has been <num value="1">one</num> of the leading objects of <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Palmerston</foreName></persName> ever since he has been in office to stimulate the production of cotton in his own dominions &mdash; or those of his sovereign &mdash; to as not to be dependent upon us for a supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>This he cannot do to any extent while his inexperienced producers have to competes with us. Cotton can be raised in their.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/><placeName reg="East Indies" key="tgn,6001831">East India</placeName> possessions and those on the <rs>Western</rs> coast of <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName> at <num value="18">18</num> or <measure n="20cents" type="currency">20 cents</measure> a pound, but it cannot be raised there <unclear>proficably</unclear> to any extent in competition with us at <num value="8">8</num> or <measure n="10cents" type="currency">10 cents</measure>. If assured, however, of no composition from this quarter they could, or it is believed would, after a while, get to producing it as cheaply as we can. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/> Improvements in agriculture are blower in their progress than in any other department of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>No <num value="1">one</num> can safely or wisely say how cheaply cotton may or may not be grown in those countries, with a few years' absolute control of the market, nor than the quality of the article may not be as good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>No <num value="1">one</num> can tell what may be effected by improvements in agriculture and the introduction of now varieties suitable to climate and soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>More money can be made here by growing cotton now at <measure n="8cents" type="currency">8 cts</measure>. a pound, than could be made at <measure n="18cents" type="currency">18 cts</measure>. <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> ago. The quality is also greatly superior to the old black seed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>More persons can now pick <measure n="300l." type="pounds"><num value="300">300</num> pounds</measure> a day than could pick <num value="100">100</num> when I can <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> recollect, and <num value="1">one</num> hand and horse or <unclear> </unclear> can cultivate twice as much land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>It is a mistake, I think, to suppose cotton cannot be grown as cheaply, and with as good a staple &mdash; fine a flore &mdash; in other countries, as it can in this &mdash; not in all places where it is now grown, but in some.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>There is nothing within the bounds of human knowledge on which reliance can be placed with such certainty as to results, as upon the laws of nature.--It is on these laws governing the race of men that our constitutions are based.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Hence, we felt so sure of our <unclear>mate</unclear> success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>And there is nothing better ascertained in the <rs>Floral Kingdom</rs> than, that on the same geological formation, within the same lines of temperature, and climatic conditions (either from <unclear> </unclear> or latitude) the same species and varieties of plants will grow, each producing its like under <unclear></unclear> culture to as great perfection in <num value="1">one</num> hemisphere as the other, and upon <num value="1">one</num> continent as another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>We have <num value="1">one</num> advantage in the production of cotton which they have not in the <rs>British Provinces</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>This has no reference to climate, soil or <unclear> </unclear> It is our system of labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>On our advantage in this particular, and to this extent, (which is no inconsiderable item.) we may rely in looking at the prospect of competition in the future, with these countries, should they by a continuation of our blockade, or our necessary abandonment of the <unclear></unclear> for a time, have the market of the world to themselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> We should not, therefore, think of abandoning the production of cotton, with any idea of thereby advancing our interests &mdash; politically &mdash; abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>This would be but playing into the hands of those powers who are trying to break it down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>We have had to curtail it, and shall have to outfall it while the war lasts &mdash; especially while the blockade continues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Duty and patriotism, as well as necessity, require this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> great object of all now should be to sustain our cause &mdash; to feed as well as clothe the men in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>To do this, besides raising sufficient provisions for home consumption, will necessarily require larger grain crops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>To have an abundance for home consumption and for the army <unclear></unclear> be the object of every <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>This is dictated by the highest considerations of home policy, and from any view of advancing our interests abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>On the contrary, after sufficient provisions are made for home consumption, and to supply the army, the more cotton that can be grown the better, How to regulate this, I know, is a difficult matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>When the duty <unclear>rests</unclear> upon all silks to grow again and raise stock for food, some may be dispect to neglect it. How to most this difficulty is <unclear></unclear> a difficult question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>It might, perhaps, be done by each <placeName reg="State">State</placeName>'s passing a similar law upon the subject limiting the production of each hand an- <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> gaged in its culture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>This would require concert of cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>What the limitation should be, I am not prepared to say. I have not the necessary estimates and statistics. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>After walking round and cursing <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and <persName n="Letcher,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Letcher,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Letcher</surname></persName> in particular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>I left, as I thought, for <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Well, I reached <placeName key="tgn,2101777" n="1.000 14" reg="tazewell, claiborne, tennessee">Tazewell</placeName>, within <placeName><distance reg="10miles">ten miles</distance> of <placeName reg="Cumberland Gap, Claiborne, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098735">Cumberland Gap</placeName></placeName>, and bought <num value="10">ten</num> mules and <num value="2">two</num> road wagons, and <num value="1">one</num> <orgName type="regiment" key="2Cav">two-horse</orgName> wagon.--I thought then I was ready to cross the mountains Just about that time there were <num value="2">two</num> men brought in--<measure n="1" type="dead">one dead</measure> and the other nearly so &mdash; both shot by bushwhackers right on the route I was to travel.--Well, I did not say much, but I tell you I did not fancy that road; no, sir, I did not. But as there were several other wagons just in the act of starting I concluded to risk it, and started with <num value="12">twelve</num> other wagons about sunrise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>We went about <num value="3">three</num> rules and met <num value="3">three</num> men, who informed us the gentlemen whackers had just shot and killed <persName n="Hillard,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Hillard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Hillard</surname></persName> and <measure n="3" type="wounded">wounded three</measure> others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>I told the boys, as we were at a good place for water, we had better stop and feed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>We did so, and kept feeding all day and night, and fad late the next morning &mdash; that is, until about <time value="12oclock">twelve o'clock</time>. We then got <num value="2">two</num> bottles of old peach, and after handing the aforesaid bottles around until the juice disappeared, we felt courageous, and thought we could face any number of bushwhackers or any other whackers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>So we put off and went about <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure>; met an old man that lived near the <rs type="place">Gap</rs>; he advised us not to go another step in that direction; said we would never live to get through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>I then proposed another <hi rend="italics">feed,</hi> which proposition was unanimously accepted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>After resting <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> I found I could get no more peach, and as that I had in me was all dying out, I began to feel that it took <hi rend="italics"><num value="2">two</num> kinds of spirits</hi> to enable a man to pass through the mountains, and as I had neither <num value="1">one</num> at hand, I slowly came to the conclusion that I was not in any great want of salt any way &mdash; in fact, did not want it at all &mdash; and as I had some urgent business down about <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName>, I turned my teams and moved slowly Southward.--Late in the evening I made up my mind that I had no use for wagons and mules, and sold out, and did well, as I made a few <num value="100">hundred</num> by that operation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/> Then went over to <placeName reg="Sevier, Tennessee, United States" key="tgn,2001914">Sevier county</placeName>, hog hunting, right into the hottest bed of the <name>Lincolnites</name> in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>There are at least <num value="1500">fifteen hundred</num> in the county.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Several persons advised me not to venture among them, but I felt sure I could manage to get along finely with them, as some of them knew me. Well, I will attempt to tell you all that passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>I will only say if <persName n="Jeff,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Jeff,nomatch:0"><surname>Jeff</surname></persName>, <persName n="Davis,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Hector,,,:1"><surname>Davis</surname></persName> could know what I said and all I said while there, he would have me hung in <measure n="48hours" type="date">forty- eight hours</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>I gently hinted that I had sometimes thought it might have been better for the <orgName n="Glorious Union" type="union">glorious Union</orgName> cause if the <rs>President</rs>--<hi rend="italics">our</hi> <rs type="role2">President</rs> (<persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>)--had not sent out his last proclamation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>They swore it was a d &mdash; d rebel lie, and concocted by the cursed rebels, solely to injure the <rs>Union</rs> cause in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, and asked me if it was possible that I (a good Union man) could for a moment be imposed upon by such a base rebel fabrication.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>I told them that I had never thought of it before, but I was willing then to bet <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">one thousand dollars</measure> that it was a forgery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/> To make short of a long story, they treated me like a prince &mdash; gave me peach, apple jack, broiled ham, scrambled eggs, in fact everything heart, or rather stomach, could call for, without price or without money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>They said a man who was right in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> was entitled to all the good things that <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName> could furnish, and told me if secesh got too hot for me in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> to go to them, and invited me to carry my family with me, and I have a ding strong notion of moving all hands up and staying with them through back bone, spare rib, and chicken season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>What do you suppose would have been my fate could they have read my heart, or could they have known that I was a candidate on a secesh ticket, and had spent half of the last <measure n="18months" type="date">eighteen months</measure> in cursing <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> tories, never forgetting <persName n="Johnson,,Andy,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="default:Johnson,Andy,,,"><foreName>Andy</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName> or Parson <persName n="Brownlow,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Brownlow,nomatch:0"><surname>Brownlow</surname></persName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>What do you say would have been my fate?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>I am myself unable to say how or in what manner they would have put me to death; but I can say with perfect safety that if they had been posted you would to-day have no daddy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/> I employed <num value="2">two</num> of them to buy hogs for me and drive them to <placeName reg="Dalton, Whitfield, Georgia" key="tgn,2022620">Dalton, Ga.</placeName>, and then put out for <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName>, and found <orgName n="army"><persName n="Gragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Gragg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Gragg</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, or a large portion of them, moving in the direction of <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, or somewhere else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>I have no idea as to the number of troops he had, nor have I any conception of the wagons and mules; but, from what I saw, think there were wagons and mules enough to pull all the houses in <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, <placeName reg="Savannah, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101410">Savannah</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName>, brick, shingles, and all, and then have a few <num value="100">hundred</num> to spare. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/> Next in order, I will tell you how I make my escape from <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>After reaching there I learned that <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName> had seised the railroad, and given orders for no <num value="1">one</num> but wounded and sick soldiers to be allowed to go aboard until they all got off, and after that the road was to be used exclusively by his troops for <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <measure n="20days" type="date">twenty days</measure>. Now, was not that a fix for a man to be caught in <placeName><distance reg="500miles">five hundred miles</distance> from home</placeName> and nary mule to ride?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>After thinking the matter over, I came to the conclusion that I was in want of a new suit of clothes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>So I went to a tailor, bought me a gray jacket and cap, such as I frequently see gentlemen volunteers have about their persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>I then went to a wood shop and purchased a pair of crutches; then an old blanket from an old negro woman, tied it around my satchel &mdash; could get no canteen or knapsack &mdash; but managed to get near the shed before the cars arrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>At last they came, and it would have killed you outright to have seen me mount my crutches, <num value="1">one</num> foot and leg twisted up, my blanket, satchel and all tied on my back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>The guard gave way, and even assisted several kind-hearted persons to get me on the train &mdash; they all expressed great sympathy and pity for the poor old fat wounded soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/><num value="1">One</num> chap said he thought the old man was about to faint, and that chap did not miss it much, for it was the hardest work I ever did in my life; but at last I was seated among the halt and the maimed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>The crowd would not average a leg round, but I had <num value="2">two</num>, and after riding about <measure n="10miles" type="distance">ten miles</measure> I made out to hobble to the water without my crutches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>A <num value="1">one</num>-legged gentleman sitting near me said I certainly improved laster than any man he ever saw. By the time I got to <placeName reg="Cleveland, Bradley, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098519">Cleveland</placeName> I was able to dispense with my blankets and crutches.--The conductor walked up to me and said he was <q>&#x0022;sold, &#x0022;</q> and promised to carry me back free of charge, and pass me back to <placeName reg="Cleveland, Bradley, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098519">Cleveland</placeName> or <placeName reg="Dalton, Whitfield, Georgia" key="tgn,2022620">Dalton</placeName> whenever it suited my convenience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>I thanked him, and told him I had no particular business in <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>I then put out for home. </p> </div3>
