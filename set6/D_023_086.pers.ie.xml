<head>The horrors of <placeName reg="Fort Lafayette">Fort Lafayette</placeName>--a Bold voice at the <rs>North</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> The <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="New York Weekly" type="newspaper">New York Weekly</orgName> Caucasian,</hi> published by the former proprietors of the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Day Book" type="newspaper">Day Book</orgName></hi> and <hi rend="italics">News,</hi> has not yet been suppressed by the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs>, though, from the following article, we should think its season will be brief: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> Few people know, or even think, of the suffering men, pining for liberty, in <placeName reg="Fort Lafayette">Fort Lafayette</placeName>, and none realize how cruelly and harshly they are reported to be treated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The <hi rend="italics">Express</hi> states that <persName n="Soule,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Soule,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Soule</surname></persName> and <persName n="Mazarean,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Mazarean,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Mazarean</surname></persName>, of New Orleans, <q>&#x0022;are not even allowed to leave their cells, and the privilege accorded to other captives, of taking exercise in the yard, has been denied them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>No writing utensils are in their reach, and they are under constant surveillance.&#x0022;</q> <persName n="Olds,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Olds,Edson,B.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Olds</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, it is said, has been placed in close confinement, and, what is most remarkable of all, the <hi rend="italics">Express </hi> report also states that <q>&#x0022;every prisoner released from <placeName reg="Fort Lafayette">Fort Lafayette</placeName>, and every visitor thereto, is bound not to reveal anything of the discipline of the prison or the names of those confined, and hence the press knows something, and can report but little, of what is going on.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> Was there over anything in <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 10" reg="Osterreich,Europe">Austrian</placeName> or <rs n="Neapolitan" type="ethnic">Neapolitan</rs> dungeons that could exceed the despotic character of such regulations?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/><q>&#x0022;The names of those confined&#x0022;</q> must not be revealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Who knows, then, how many people are languishing there, or for what trivial offences?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>We know of <num value="1">one</num> man who was kept in <placeName reg="Fort Lafayette">Fort Lafayette</placeName> last year for <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> because his children raised upon a pole a rag through which he had been straining black berries!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Some neighbor, who was at enmity with him, started the report that he had raised <q>&#x0022;a secession flag,&#x0022; </q> and suddenly he was arrested, hurried off hundreds of miles, (he resided in <placeName reg="Michigan" key="tgn,7007520">Michigan</placeName>) and incarcerated in <placeName reg="Fort Lafayette">Fort Lafayette</placeName>, and kept there more than half a year without any attention being paid to his case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>He was finally informed that there was no charge against him, and allowed to go. <num value="6">Six</num> ladious months of cruel imprisonment, simply on account of a little harmless playfulness of his children!--Can that be called a free or just Government under which such shameful outrages are perpetrated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>And yet this is but a sample of what arbitrary arrests must and will ever be. If any persons have committed offences, let them be tried and punished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>It is folly to say the law is not adequate to reach all cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>It is adequate to punish all <hi rend="italics">real</hi> offences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>It is only because the powers that be wish to torture into terms acts that are <hi rend="italics">not</hi> crimes, that they resort to the high handed measures they do. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> A few days since some <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> speculators in the substitute business, who had violated the orders of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, were sent to <placeName reg="Fort Lafayette">Fort Lafayette</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The Abolition papers, however, made a great howl over it, and they have been released.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>There are, however, scores of better men and truer patriots in there than those released, in whose behalf not a word is uttered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>There is <persName n="Carmichael,Judge,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Carmichael,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Carmichael</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, Guilty of what!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Why, of the gross crime (<num value="1">1</num>) of telling the <rs>Grand Jury</rs> of his county what the law in relation to arrests was. For months has <rs type="role2">Judge</rs> C. suffered the horrors of the <name>Bastile</name>, for simply doing his duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Is it possible, therefore, that the recent <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> outburst of indignation against arbitrary arrests proceeds from any regard for the principles of civil liberty?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>No, it is the grossest hypocrisy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>They wish only <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs> to be imprisoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>If they are sincere, why do they not ask for the release of <persName n="Olds,Doctor,Edson,B.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="default:Olds,Edson,B.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>Edson</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Olds</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, now in the fort, for simply expressing an opinion against the <name>Administration</name>?--How many more good and true men are also in the same gloomy prison walls, against whom no charges are preferred, we can only conjecture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>We hear every day of men arrested in different parts of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>They are spirited away, their friends and their families know not whither.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Some dark and no some prison vault receives them, and they are buried alive!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Where is <persName n="Mahoney,,D.,A.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="default:Mahoney,D.,A.,,"><foreName>D.</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName> <surname>Mahoney</surname></persName>, <rs type="role">Esq.</rs>, of the <orgName n="Dubuque Herald" type="newspaper">Dubuque <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName>, the central organ of the lowa Democracy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Where is <persName n="Sherwood,Mister,D.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="default:Sherwood,D.,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>D.</foreName> <surname>Sherwood</surname></persName>, editor of the <rs>Fairfield</rs> (<rs n="Iowa" type="nativeamerican">Iowa</rs>) <hi rend="italics">Union,</hi> recently snatched from his family by the <rs>Lincoln Kidnappers</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Where is <persName n="Allen,Judge,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Allen,William,,,:1"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <surname>Allen</surname></persName>, member of Congress recently elected from <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251"><rs type="direction">Southern</rs> Illinois</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>We might increase this list indefinitely, but it is not necessary.--If there is but <num value="1">one</num> man unjustly deprived of his liberty, it ought to arouse every <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> to instant action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The principle is the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Our liberties are overthrown, and the rights of the individual are left to the whim or caprice of some upstart official.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>There is a day of retribution coming, however, for the murderers of liberty and the persecutors of <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs> amongst us. As <persName n="Valiandignam,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Valiandignam,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Valiandignam</surname></persName> says in his excellent speech, which we publish this week, <q>&#x0022;the measure they have meted out to us shall be measured to them again.&#x0022;</q> Yes, that it will, <q>&#x0022;shaken down and pressed together.&#x0022;</q> <q>&#x0022;The arrest of <persName n="Olds,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="nearbymention:Olds,Edson,B.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Olds</surname></persName>,&#x0022;</q> chuckles the <name>Abolition</name> tyrants of the <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Evening Post" type="newspaper">Evening Post</orgName>,</hi> <q>&#x0022;and the summary squelching of <persName n="Ingersoll,,Charles,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="default:Ingersoll,Charles,,,"><foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Ingersoll</surname></persName>, show that the <rs>Government</rs> is wide awake!&#x0022;</q> Yes, indeed, it is wide awake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>It can conquer unarmed men, and that seems to be about the extent of its victories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>It can send posses of kidnappers to the houses of quiet citizens in the <rs>North</rs>, gag them, and bind them, and immure them in forts and fortifications; but it has not the ability, with hundreds of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of troops, to keep the <rs>Confederates</rs> from besieging the <rs>National Capital</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>It can wreak a petty vengeance upon some individual, who has had too much honesty to bend before its usurpations; but it is incompetent to save the country from the calamities which menace it. It loves duplicity and deceit, and pays a high premium for them, in the person of the renegade <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs> who go over to it for plunder and pelf; but it especially hates manliness and honesty, and persecutes every individual who possesses enough of these qualities to tell it of its faults or rebuke its follies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>It has finally convicted itself of party favoritism by releasing from imprisonment men of its own party and retaining <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs> in custody, though the offences charged were the same in both cases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/><persName n="Olds,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="nearbymention:Olds,Edson,B.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Olds</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Ohio, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007706">Ohio</placeName>, is charged with discouraging enlistments, yet he is imprisoned, while <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republicans</rs> are released!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>It is no wonder that some of its own party papers are calling for the resignation of a President who has allowed the <rs>Government</rs> to degenerate into an organization which would seem to exist, just now, mainly for the persecution of those who have intelligence enough to see the truth, and manliness enough to utter it. </p> </div3>

<head>The secret society &mdash; movements in the <rs>Northwest</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> The stories about the existence of a league of <q>&#x0022;Knights of the <rs>Golden Circle</rs>&#x0022;</q> in the <rs>Northwest</rs>, which have been circulated in the New York press, appear to have some foundation in fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>A correspondent of the <orgName n="New York Times" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName>, writing from <placeName reg="Vincennes, Knox, Indiana" key="tgn,7018808">Vincennes, Ind.</placeName>, says that there the people are living over the <q>&#x0022;fires of a volcano that may burst any hour.&#x0022;</q> He says: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> There is an organization in the <rs>Western States</rs> known as the <name>Knights</name> of the <rs>Golden Circle</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>I believe it is not known in the <rs>Eastern</rs> and Northern States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Its members have been most successful in securing offices in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>I know several who hold positions there, and it is strange how they get them, but those I refer to I know to be sympathizers with the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Again, they are most active at home in poisoning the minds of the people against the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Since our late reverses on the <rs>Potomac</rs> they are exceedingly exultant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Richard,Henry,,:1"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s proclamation in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, they say, is the right doctrine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>That, they say, utters the sentiments of genuine republicanism and liberty, and that the policy of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s Administration is tyranny and oppression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>These sentiments are openly avowed by many with whom you are acquainted in this place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>The utterances of such sentiment is bad enough, but it is evident that but an opportunity is wanted to inaugurate a guerrilla warfare in the <name>States</name> north of the <rs>Ohio</rs> &mdash; and that opportunity will not be wanting so soon as the troops called for have gone to the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>A few days since we had at <placeName reg="Lawrenceville, Lawrence, Illinois" key="tgn,2028725">Lawrenceville</placeName> an instance of the effect of the spirit of lawlessness which pervades society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>A narrow-minded, bigoted, vicious <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrat</rs>, without any cause of quarrel, but as a proof that he was not for negro equality, met a negro, took up a club and knocked him down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>This occurred a few miles north of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>A number of persons were present who testify that the negro said not a word to his assailant before or after the assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The next day the negro came to town and made complaint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>His assailant expecting that a writ would be issued also came to town and told the constable he had better not attempt to serve the writ; that he intended that night to kill the negro, and if the officer attempted to serve the writ he would kill him. That night this fellow and <num value="14">fourteen</num> others, all <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs> and Knights of the <rs>Golden Circle</rs>, armed themselves, passed openly through <placeName reg="Lawrenceville, Lawrence, Illinois" key="tgn,2028725">Lawrenceville</placeName>, and beat over to where the negro lived, shot him and stabbed him <num value="9">nine</num> times with a bowie-knife, of course killing him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/> There can, however, we trust, be no fears of the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>It is scarcely possible to conceive that anything has been neglected which ought to have been done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>There is every reason to believe that our brave troops will defend these cherished cities to the last gasp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/><num value="1">One</num> thing they ought to do which has not been done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>They should call back their absentees or refugees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>The communities in which they have found a covert should assist them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>A crushing scorn should over whelm the able bodied man who flees from an imperilled city of which he is a native or a citizen, or in which he has accumulated health.--In such a case no age or calling constitutes an exemption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/> The history of <num value="1">one</num> republic is rich in instances of heroic defence of cities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>Reference is made to the <name>Netherlands</name> during the lifetime of <persName><foreName>William</foreName></persName> of <placeName reg="Orange, Essex, New Jersey" key="tgn,2065747">Orange</placeName>, a hero who deserves to be placed by the side of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>There are strong points of resemblance between the rise of the <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> Republic and that of our own Confederacy. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>The latter had the largest and best army in the world &mdash; veteran troops, trained by <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName></persName> and commanded by that great General, the <rs>Duke</rs> of <persName><foreName>Alva</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>The former had no organized army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>Its population was small; its resources limited; its territory insignificant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>Yet for <measure n="80years" type="date">eighty years</measure> it waged war with the most potent empire upon earth and during the progress of the struggle became &#x0022;a mighty State, binding about its own slender form a zone of the richest possessions of earth from pole to tropic; finally dictating its decrees to the <rs>Empire</rs> of <persName><foreName>Charles</foreName></persName>.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/> The parallel is clear thus far &mdash; our enemy outnumbers us in men and exceeds us in resources, as did <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> the <name>Netherlands</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>The purpose of <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> was the absolute subjugation of the rebellions provinces.--Its intention was &#x0022;to crush out the rebellion.&#x0022; The following is the language of <persName><foreName>Philip</foreName></persName>: &#x0022;But if ye disregard those offers of mercy, receiving them with closed ears as heretofore, then we warn you that there is no rigor, nor cruelty however great, while you are to expect, by laying waste, starvation and the sword, in such manner that nowhere shall remain a relic of that which at present exists; but <name n="his Majesty" type="role">His Majesty</name> will strip bare and utterly depopulate the land, and cause it to be inhabited again by strangers; since otherwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>The Union was perverted from its purposes, so that it became a benefit to others and an injury to us, and we determined to leave it.--Coercion was threatened and we resisted it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>He unlocked the outer gate of the outer safe, where the general books were kept, and passed through to the inner safe, in which were kept the deeds and valuable securities on which my uncle lent money; this was separated from the outer safe by an iron gate in the daytime, and at night by a solid fire-proof door. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/> He put his books on the shelf, and requested me to put mine on the same shelf in the proper order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>The numbers on the backs were almost illegible, and I was some time, even in the strong <rs n="Gas Light" type="newspaper">gas-light</rs>, trying to read them. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/> I put up the last book, and turned to go.--The heavy door swung rapidly on its hinges; I heard the spring catch, and the key turn, and I was in black darkness. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/> I heard the heavy clash of the door of the outer safe, and then silence, as deep as death, was round me. I did not swoon or faint.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>I felt I was the victim of a most horrible trick; <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> it was nothing more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>I should be released in the morning, and I would make him repent it. I heard presently a hissing sound &mdash; it continued; presently I smelled gas. I should never see the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>I should be stitled with the noise &mdash; the plan was clear before me now. All accident &mdash; no <num value="1">one</num> knew I helped him with the books &mdash; he did not know I was in the safe, and he shut the door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>It was purely <num value="1">one</num> of those accidents that will happen. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/> Still the gas missed like a serpent before its fatal spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>I must stop that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>I felt round the walls for the burner, and soon found it.--There was no tap!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>I remembered now the tap was in the outer safe, and the gas was lighted in the inner <num value="1">one</num> by a long stick between the bars of the gate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>My fingers stopped it in a moment, but I could not keep my finger there always.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>I tried, and the arm became so tired of the contracted position above my head, that I could not keep my finger over it to save my life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>I thought of some other plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>To light it &mdash; alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>I did not smoke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>I had no means to do it, and if I had, it would only have consumed the air, every inch of which was precious as life itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>At last I thought of something that would do. I tore some corners off the leaves of a book, chewed them into a pulp, and put it over the holes in the tube, pressing it in hard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>The hissing ceased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>I climbed the shelves and smelled round the burner &mdash; I had <num value="1">one</num> foe the less.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>I then began to think seriously as to the chances of the air lasting me till released in the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>In the morning?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>This was, O. <name n="God" type="God">God</name>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/><dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>! <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>! <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>--<num value="2">two</num> nights and a whole day!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>There was no hope!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>I might have lived till the morning, but on Sunday there was no business done, and my absence would be assign accounted for by that horrible mistake in my book. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/> <num value="2">Two</num> nights and a day &mdash; how many hours?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>To <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> at <num value="5">five</num>, <num value="24">twenty-four</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>To <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> at <num value="10">ten</num>, <num value="17">seventeen</num>. <num value="41">Forty-one</num> long hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/><measure n="41hours" type="date">Forty-one hours</measure>. There was not air enough to last me <num value="10">ten</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>I felt round the door; it was all but air-proof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>If I could make them hear!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>It was impossible; the house was the other side of a noisy court-yard; I must die!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>And Victorine!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>No, no; <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> times no. I must live; I will live. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/> I bethought me of my old store of knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>How long could I live without fresh air?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>How many hours had I in which to reach it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>I paced the length and breadth of the room; I measured its height, and found that by breathing only <num value="20">twenty</num> times a minute I might live for <measure n="13hours" type="date">thirteen hours</measure>, that would be till <time value="6oclock">6 o'clock</time> on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>; and after that I must have air &mdash; air was life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>I must bore through the walls; the lock was impregnable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>The walls of brick would yield to tools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>Tools! mockery! I had but a penknife; a toy; and I had <measure n="13hours" type="date">thirteen hours</measure> to get through a wall at least <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two feet</measure> thick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>It was a work of years, not hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>Tools! A long-pointed bar and a hammer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>I remembered to have seen a mason boring through a wall at my father's with such tools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>My penknife was <measure n="2inches" type="distance">two inches</measure> long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>The gas-burner!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>I tried it; it was soft brass; my knife cut it readily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>It might work through beside the gas-pipe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>The man surely bored a larger hole than the pipe would fill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>I felt the pipe where it went round the wall, and then pricked the wall with my knife &mdash; the cement with which the hole had been filled round the pipe was harder than the wall itself. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/> In tracing my way round the room my hand touched the gate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>I was saved!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>I never felt such a sensation as when my hand touched that gate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>It was rapture!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>bliss! I had despaired &mdash; I was now full of hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>I passed my hand carefully over the gate; I felt <num value="1">one</num> of the bars, they were of round iron, about <num value="3">three</num>-quarters of an inch in thickness, and after running through the frame-work of the gate were pointed at the end. But to get them out of that frame-work!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>I pulled <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>It yielded a little, and then mocked at my efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>I must have a hammer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>I felt carefully round the walls again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>The shelves were all let into the walls &mdash; there was nothing!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>I felt again, and close to the gate the shelf had been cut away to allow the gate to roll back, and the shelves were supported on brackets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>If those brackets were wrought-iron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>I was helpless &mdash; cast-iron might save me yet. I felt them carefully and compared them; if they were wrought, they would be unlike in some points &mdash; if cast, alike in all. I knew now what the touch of the blind must be, so full of instruction to the mind. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/> They were cast-iron, not a trace of difference could be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/><num value="1">One</num> more sign and I was certain; if cast, they would be cast in a mould, and there would be a slight roughness in the casting where the halves of the mould had been joined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>I felt again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>There was the roughness &mdash; the same in both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>And now to break them off. A blow, a heavy blow, alone could do it. I remembered to have noticed, when putting away the books, a small chest of apparently solid iron on <num value="1">one</num> of the shelves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>I sought for it and found it; it was heavy, nearly the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> of a hundredweight, I thought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>I poised it carefully, and felt I had strength enough to throw it with an aim. I cleared away the books from the slate shelf which rested on <num value="1">one</num> of these brackets, and then measuring carefully the distance, threw the chest on to it. It fell short and crashed on the floor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/> Once more I tried, and this time successfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>The missile smashed the shelf into pieces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>I kicked and beat away the smaller fragments till the bracket stood out from the wall by itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>And now came the test of my skill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>If I threw once at the bracket in that black darkness I threw <num value="20">twenty</num> times or more; at last, <num value="1">one</num> fortunately directed blow, and I had the joy of hearing it ring on the pavement of the room. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/> I had now a hammer &mdash; awkward, it is true &mdash; still a tool that would give a blow with a certain force. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/> I struck again and again at the bars of the gate, they yielded as the other had done and then were fast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>I sank down exhausted with my useless efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>Why did they not yield?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>I could give no more force to the blow &mdash; to throw the chest at them would be useless; the size would spread the blow over <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> of the bars, and the force would be lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>I must cut through <num value="1">one</num> of the bars in the middle and thus wrench out the half I needed.--How had I seen men cut through iron?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>With files &mdash; I could not hope for these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>I remembered to have heard of prisoners who cut through iron bars with a watch spring &mdash; by what horrible fatality was my watch at that moment in the case on my dressing-table.--A watch spring &mdash; a thin piece of steel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>Would iron do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>It might.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>In almost less time than it takes to tell I had broken up <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs n="sheet iron" type="product">sheet-iron</rs> deed boxes, and by carefully bending a piece of it back ward and forward on the sharp edge of the chest I had used as a missile, I obtained a strip about the length of my hand, and <num value="2">two</num> fingers broad, and with this I commenced sawing <num value="1">one</num> of the bars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>Half an hour's hard work produced no impression on the bar, and had turned up the edge of the soft <rs n="sheet iron" type="product">sheet-iron</rs> on both sides. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/> If it had been a question of saws, I could have turned <num value="10">ten</num> deed boxes into a <num value="100">hundred</num> saws to cut through that <num value="1">one</num> bar. Alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>it was no such thing, the saw would not cut; and then sprung up before me the vision of a large yard with blocks of stone and the motion to and fro of the suspended saw of the stone sawyer, and his little tricking water barrel and heap of sand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>Once more I went to work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>I broke off the corner of <num value="1">one</num> of the stone shelves (the lower ones were of stone, the upper of slate,) pounded it fine with my hammer, and then wetting the edge of the saw with saliva, I strewed the pounded stone upon it. I felt the saw become steadier and steadier, and at last I could feel with my nail a little nick in the bar. I worked for nearly <measure n="3hours" type="date">three hours</measure> at this <num value="1">one</num> bar, changing my saw when it was worn hollow for another and another till I had worn out <num value="6">six</num> of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>I was nearly through &mdash; another half-hour and I should be quite through; yet it might break off now with a blow &mdash; it might &mdash; and it might leave a ragged end to my chisel that would destroy half the force of my blows when I came to bore through the wall; I would not strike, but kept on patiently, and at last the saw went through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>I seized the end, and in a few minutes I held in my hand the instrument of my deliverance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/> The air of the room had by this time become close and stilting, and it was only by stooping what I could breathe freely. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/> I had still, as far as I could judge, some <measure n="5hours" type="date">five hours</measure> left; in those I must accomplish my deliverance or die. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/> I now commenced sounding with my hammer for the feast solid part of the wall. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/> In striking it on a part nearly opposite the shelves cut out for the gate, I thought I heard it sound hollow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>I struck again and again without success, it all seemed alike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>Once more I determined to strike over the whole space I had previously struck, this I did, and found the spot about the size of a penny piece from which the sound came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>I then carefully <milestone unit="column" n="6"/> felt the wall in the neighborhood, and found a rough indented line ran from this place round the angle of the wall, and on the wall in the same line were <num value="3">three</num> small holes in a circle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>I decided at once that this was the place of some burner fixed, and afterward removed; the rough line was the mark left by the pipe, and the hollow place must be the hole through which the old pipe entered the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>I drove the chisel into the place and found it hard, very hard, but still hollow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>My life now hung upon the choice of a right place; if this hole was filled up with the hard cement, and the difference of sound arose merely from difference in density, then I had better try the wall over for a brick softer than the rest; but if it was not full &mdash; if those who should have filled it had put but a few inches of cement at each end of the hole &mdash; then, in another hour, I was as safe as if I were free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>I would risk it. The hollow sound was so cheery that I <hi rend="italics">would</hi> believe that it must be a true guide. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/> Blow after blow, and the hole grew deep, and my progress less as my control over the point of the instrument lessened when <num value="1">one</num> sudden, sharp blow drove the chisel into the wall the length of my arm. The place was hollow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>I had now but to drive it through the crust of cement on the outer wall, and I should live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>I drove it cautiously and carefully, and at last heard the echo of the pieces falling on the other side, and, drawing out the chisel, felt the air rush in. How can words convey the sensation I experienced as I drew in the <name n="God" type="God">God</name>-given breath of life!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>I could now defy Death; there was a fountain at which I might drink and live. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/> For hours I sat close to the hole and breathed, and then fell asleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>I know now how long I slept, but I awoke sore and tired, and with a horrible headache and <unclear></unclear> on me. I could not have many hours to stay; so I hoped on, and tightened my belt to case the gnawing pain at my stomach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>And now began the horrors of solitude; while I had employment for the mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>I felt no pain of any kind; now I was going mad with anxiety and fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>I must find some employment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>And what?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>in this utter darkness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>But if darkness, why not light?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>Yes, I would have light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>For this I must enlarge the hole, and went to work again with blistered hands, and in <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> had enlarged it to twice its original diameter, and had consequently <num value="4">four</num> times as much air flowing in. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>My next step was to grate from the cages of a book a paper powder for tinder, and spreading this on the ground in a heap, I struck with the point of my hammer the stone shelf above it. The sparks flew about at the contact, but it was at least an hour before <num value="1">one</num> lodged in a heap and set it smouldering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>I watched anxiously as the little red ring grew larger and brighter in the heap, and then applying a piece of thin paper rolled to a fine point to the centre of the ring, I gently blew the redness into a flame &mdash; yes, flame!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>Real flame, that blinded me by its brightness, that seemed to pierce my brain with a sword, so long and deep had been the darkness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/> I took my paper stop from oil the gas and heard the serpent hiss once more &mdash; this time without fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>I lit the issuing gas, and then sat looking at it as Bartimens might have done in the joy of his new found sight. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/> I had done; I had light and air; but still I must have employment, or I should rave. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/> Employment. The thought came to me of that unfortunate sentence that had caused me to run this risk: <q>&#x0022;If I had access to his books I would prove that fraud was possible.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>Could &mdash; I must &mdash; my good name depended on proving it. If he were true, I was false.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>I set to work, and with my pencil, which I happily had with me, I went through account after account, from beginning to end, and well was I rewarded; for I learned that my uncle, supposed to be rich, had been systematically robbed for years by this scoundrel, and was now almost ruined, and that his daughter's portion, invested in <name>English</name> securities, had been sold out, and the interest paid by <persName n="Vernay,,M.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00065" reg="default:Vernay,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Vernay</surname></persName> himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>So that father and daughter were at the mercy of this man. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/> These facts I learned from a small locked book that was in a box marked with <persName n="Vernay,,M.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00066" reg="default:Vernay,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Vernay</surname></persName>'s name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>So confident had the servant been of his master's trust in him that he had left in that master's safe the whole of the securities of his nefarious investments, and there they were, with a systematic account of them in this locked book; so that while the master, who was supposed to be worth his hundreds of <num value="1000">thousands</num>, was almost a bankrupt, his clerk was a man of immense wealth. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/> When I broke the lock of that book and read down its columns I felt a joy and a pleasure that would have enabled me again to endure what I had suffered if it would have led to the same result. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/> I made notes of the whole affair, and took the securities into my possession, and then calmly waited long, long hours; I could not tell how long; for I was waked up from a kind of stupor by the sound of a door opening, and then I heard the voice I knew so well &mdash; that of <persName n="Vernay,,M.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00067" reg="default:Vernay,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Vernay</surname></persName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/> He was speaking to the porter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>I heard the muffled-sounding footsteps; I heard the key turn in the lock; and then, as the door opened, I stood face to face with my foe, and where he expected to find darkness and death he found light and life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>He saw me &mdash; saw in my hand his book that contained the secrets of a lifetime, with the lock forced &mdash; saw his schemes defeated, and himself an outcast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>It was too much for his mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>He shrieked a cry of mingled horror and fear, and fell forward in the doorway as if he were dead. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/> I went up-stairs to the office, said to the porter, <q>&#x0022;<persName n="Vernay,,M.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00068" reg="default:Vernay,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Vernay</surname></persName> is below in the strong room; go down and see to him,&#x0022;</q> and went over to the house. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/> I suffered a long illness, during the whole of which Victorine was my nurse, and, thanks to that and a good constitution, I recovered, and got up such a clear case against <persName n="Vernay,,M.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00069" reg="default:Vernay,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Vernay</surname></persName> that the whole of the property I had rescued was restored to my uncle. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>He cannot fail to admire the remarkable simplicity of the doctor in his hope of being spared his property because of his neutrality in this war and his scrupulous abstinence from assisting either of the belligerents in any way whatever; and especially will he be amused at the doctor's frank confession that he had reserved out of the catalogue of his assets <hi rend="italics"><measure n="3000dollars" type="currency">three thousand dollars</measure> in gold </hi> for <q>&#x0022;an emergency!&#x0022;</q> Was there ever such an instance of excessive greenness?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/> --<hi rend="italics">Shortness of the <name>Crop</name>.</hi>--There can now be but little doubt concerning the shortness of the wheat crop throughout the <rs type="direction">North</rs> <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149"><rs type="direction">western</rs> United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/>The <orgName n="Chicago Tribune" type="newspaper">Chicago <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi></orgName>, of the <dateStruct value="--30"><day reg="30">30th ult.</day></dateStruct>, says: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/> In <placeName key="tgn,7007251" n="1.000 2052" reg="illinois">Illinois</placeName> the crop of winter wheat was good; but that of spring wheat turns out to be sadly deficient in yield and very inferior in quality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>In the central counties of the <rs>State</rs> the berry is shriveled and shrunken, and the average is not over <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of last year's yield.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/>In the more northerly counties the yield is not more than <num value="7">seven</num> bushels per acre on an average, and many fields were damaged to such an extent by the <q>&#x0022;bug&#x0022;</q> that they were not worth cutting. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/> In <placeName reg="Wisconsin, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007922">Wisconsin</placeName> the crop is also short.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>In the northerly counties the quality is good, but the quantity is much below that of last year's crop; while in the centre and southern counties the wheat is very deficient both in quality and yield. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/> In <rs n="Iowa" type="nativeamerican">Iowa</rs> the quality will average better than in <placeName key="tgn,7007251" n="1.000 2052" reg="illinois">Illinois</placeName> and <placeName reg="Wisconsin" key="tgn,7007922"><rs type="direction">Southern</rs> Wisconsin</placeName>, but the yield is not over half of the crop of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/>In some of the northern counties the crop is excellent in quality, and the yield, though not as heavy as last year, is satisfactory. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/> In <placeName reg="Minnesota, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007521">Minnesota</placeName> the crop is excellent as to quality, and there is not much complaint about the yield.--The rapid increase in the farming population of this State within a year will insure a much heavier surplus this year then ever before. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/> With regard to the corn crop there is not so much certainty, but the late planting, owing to the wet spring, will doubtless operate against it in the central and northern counties of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> and <rs n="Iowa" type="nativeamerican">Iowa</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>The scarcity of field laborers also will prevent its being gathered, and much will be destroyed in consequence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/>Under any circumstances, it is conceded on all hands that the crop cannot approach in quantity or quality that of last year. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/> Thus much for the <rs>Northwestern States</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/> With regard to the foreign demand for breadstuffs, there is every reason to believe that it will be fully equal to our surplus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/>Although both <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> have fell average crops, the stocks are so reduced that it will be <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> at least before they are up to an average condition.
