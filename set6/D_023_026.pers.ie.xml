<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>He says I deserted on the<date value="06-26">26th of June,</date> which was the day before the <num value="1">one</num> on which the grand series of battles began below <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>To refute this charge, I shall give a plain and truthful statement of the facts in the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>On the <date value="06-25">25th of June,</date> being very unwell with an attack of bloody dysentery, (with which I have suffered very much, since I had a violent attack of typhoid fever at <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName> last <dateStruct value="-09-"><month reg="09">September</month></dateStruct>,) I applied to <persName n="Furgeson,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0003.00000.00317" reg="mostcommon:Furgeson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Furgeson</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="assistant-Surgeon">assistant surgeon</rs> of the regiment, for medicine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>He gave me some pills; and before day on the <num value="26" type="ordinal">26th</num> the regiment was ordered out to the point of attack on the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/><persName n="Furgeson,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0003.00000.00318" reg="mostcommon:Furgeson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Furgeson</surname></persName> refused to excuse me from duty, and I had to start with my company; but becoming exhausted, was left on the road, from whence I finally succeeded in getting back to camp, where my captain and several others of the company were &mdash; they having been excused from duty by <persName n="Furgeson,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0003.00000.00319" reg="mostcommon:Furgeson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Furgeson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>I remained at the camp, still sick, as my captain well knows, until about the <date value="07- 06">6th of July,</date> when I went up to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> and reported myself to the surgeon at <placeName reg="Chimborazo hospital">Chimborazo hospital</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>He received me into the hospital, and treated my disease for several days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>I was then sent from there, in company with <num value="80">eighty</num> others, to the <rs type="place">Huguenot Springs hospital</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>After being there a short time, I got a transfer to my home, believing, as the surgeon did at the <rs type="place">Springs hospital</rs>, that I would improve faster at home than in the hospital, and thereby be able sooner to return to my place in my company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>My captain and comrades know full well that I have always discharged my duties as a soldier in my country's cause, to the best of my ability; and believing this plain, unvarnished statement of the facts will satisfy my friends at home that I am not a deserter, I will drop this portion of that advertisement. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/> As to my having a forged pass, it is only necessary to say, that my friends and neighbors in <placeName key="tgn,2002176" n="1.000 10" reg="Nottoway, Virginia, United States">Nottoway</placeName> and elsewhere, as well as my comrades in arms, all know me to be incapable of so base a crime as forgery.
