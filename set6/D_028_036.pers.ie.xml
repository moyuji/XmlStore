<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> As we anticipated, the refusal of the <rs>Southern Commissioners</rs> to accept terms of degradation, which those who proposed them knew could not be accepted, has been followed by a menace of exterminating vengeance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s newspaper organ, the <hi rend="italics">Chronicle,</hi> says <q>&#x0022;the sword of justice must execute the work which the folly of blinded leaders would not accord to the arts of pacification.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The whole mission of <persName n="Blair,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Blair,nomatch:0"><surname>Blair</surname></persName> to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> was designed for no other purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Was ever a country before, with <num value="3">three</num> large armies in the field, called upon to lay down its arms in unconditional submission; to give the party making the demand the right to hang its principal citizens if he chose to exercise it; to surrender its whole property, as the only condition of peace?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>And could a Government, making such a proposition, seriously expect compliance?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Could it expect the most heroic race of men on this continent to sheathe their swords upon such terms?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Could it believe the <rs>Southern</rs> people would give up that whole slave property at the summons of an act of Congress, which the vast armies of the <rs>North</rs> have been unable to take from them in a gigantic war of <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure>? No such insane expectation was ever indulged by the subtle and malignant schemer who set on foot the <name>Blair</name> mission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>He knew as well the result of that negotiation before it began as when it ended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Its only design was to represent the <rs>Federal Government</rs> to the <rs>North</rs>, and to the world, as seeking in vain to recall, by pacific measures, the <rs>Southern States</rs> to the fraternity of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Commonwealths, and thus to justify, as the punishment of incurable obstinacy, a policy of confiscation and extermination, which has been the real purpose of this whole war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The Northern people, living under an inclement sky, and on a soil that requires incessant labor to produce the bare necessaries of life, have long looked with an envious and greedy eye upon the rich plains, the genial suns and the overflowing comfort of Southern life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The abolition crusade has been manipulated by <persName n="Seward,,W.,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="default:Seward,W.,H.,,"><foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName> with no other design than to pave the way for an exodus of the overflowing Northern hive to the green pastures and fertile fields of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>If the object of this invasion were the restoration of the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName>, what easier than for <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Seward,W.,H.,,"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> to propose to our Commissioners reconstruction and a guarantee of the rights enjoyed by the <rs>South</rs> in the old Government?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>But he had no such purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>He made demands which he was sure we would refuse, only to have a pretext for drawing &#x0022;the sword of justice,&#x0022; or, what is meant thereby, exterminating, as far as practicable, the <rs>Southern</rs> population, and transferring every acre of Southern land to Northern hands. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> Now that this diabolical purpose is deliberately avowed, we shall see whether it can be executed with that impunity which has hitherto attended <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> outrages, and which has emboldened them to threaten infinitely greater horrors and injustice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Mean and servile natures uniformly become ferocious and even valiant when they have an unresisting prey.--To hunt a hare is a more exciting pastime to some sportsmen than to face a lion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Hitherto <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> atrocities have been met by threats of retaliation, at which they only laughed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>They have misunderstood the character of this people from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>They misconstrue their moderation and humanity into abject fear, or, at best, refer it to sagacious policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The fear of <hi rend="italics">them</hi> does not exist in these latitudes; and when they <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> draw that &#x0022;sword of justice,&#x0022; policy, interest and vengeance will speak but <num value="1">one</num> voice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>They will then discover that there are <num value="2">two</num> who can draw such a sword, and that we are not going to be robbed of our lives, liberty and property, without an effort at vengeance and retribution. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> In despite of the prevailing tendencies of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> to believe neither in <name n="God" type="God">God</name> nor man, there still remains considerable disposition to patronise those books of Revelation known as the Old Testament.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>There is a traditional reverence for the Old Dispensation, handed down from the founders of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, which still lingers in the bosom of the present generation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>But for the heretical views of Slavery expressed in the book, it would now be <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> to no other work in popular estimation, except the philosophical productions of <persName n="Emerson,,Ralph,Waldo,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="default:Emerson,Ralph,Waldo,,"><foreName>Ralph</foreName> <foreName>Waldo</foreName> <surname>Emerson</surname></persName>, which, being devoid of all mystery, and comprehensible by every understanding, must always have precedence of the <name>Pentateuch</name> and the <name>Prophets</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>With all its drawbacks, however, the Old Testament is still the textbook of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> theology, and the sole source which the religion of that land claims as its fountain head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The New Testament is a book never much in vogue with <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritans</rs> or Pharisees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>It has in it too much mercy, forbearance and charity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>It is intolerant to nothing but sin. It permits and hallows all enjoyment not inconsistent with purity of heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>It especially requires forgiveness of enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Hence its unpopularity with the <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> race. --Hence it is that the people of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> are mostly Unitarians, not recognizing the <name>Divinity</name> of the <name>Founder</name> of Christianity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Hewing Agag to pieces and exterminating nations are congenial to their tastes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>It is true that these races had provoked the vengeance of Heaven by abominable crimes, and that the children of <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName> were hurled upon these criminals as the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of Nature sometimes overwhelms even innocent nations with earthquakes, tornadoes and floods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>But all enemies of the <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> are abominable criminals; he and his are the elect, the peculiar people, and Christianity interferes with their recognized patent of vengeance and annihilation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Hence the preference of the Old Testament to the <rs>New</rs>, and the universal custom of naming all children after the principal characters of the Old Dispensation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Those patriarchs and prophets had many cruel trials and persecutions to endure, but, among them all, none more galling than the wholesale appropriation of their names by the <name>Sons</name> of the <name>Pilgrims</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>What had they done that they should not only be persecuted in life, but caricatured in death?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Instead of entering upon their rest, they must all be in purgatory if they know what is going on earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Should the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> succeed in overrunning the <rs>South</rs>, we may expect to see the patriarchs and prophets, the warriors and sages, of the Old Dispensation still further complimented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The heathen names of our States, counties, hills and rivers, would be made to correspond to the Old Dispensation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/><placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> would be a new <placeName key="possibilities=25" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Jerusalem</placeName>, and the <rs>James</rs>, which has proved such a hard road to travel, the <rs>Jordan</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The <rs type="place">Blue Ridge</rs>, whose color remains loyal, would be the only object of inanimate nature that would preserve its ancient name. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> The <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> theologians have discovered a resemblance between the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName> and that of the <num value="12">twelve</num> tribes of <placeName key="tgn,1000119" n="1.000 3" reg="yisra'el">Israel</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>We are unable to perceive the analogy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>It is true that, in some respects, the sons of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> are the genuine children of <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>The envy which led <num value="10">ten</num> of them to conspire the death of the most virtuous of their number is a feature common to both and the general characteristics of the family, as described by <persName><foreName>Jacob</foreName></persName>, their father, on his death bed, are not unlike the <name>Sons</name> of the <name>Pilgrims</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The worship of the <rs>Golden Calf</rs>, the martyrdom of the best and wisest men, the whiteness of the sepulchres, and the corruption within, are the same in both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>But the <num value="12">twelve</num> tribes were independent of each other, <name n="God" type="God">God</name> being their only governor; and when, on <num value="1">one</num> occasion, they proposed to make war upon a refractory tribe, they were forbidden.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Even under a king when a <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> large number of the tribes rebelled, and the king assembled an army of <num value="180000">180,000</num> men to reduce the rebels to subjection, &#x0022;The word of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> came unto Shemaiah, the man of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, saying, Speak unto Rehoboam, the <persName n="Solomon,IsFather,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Solomon,nomatch:0"><roleName n="IsFather">son of</roleName> <surname>Solomon</surname></persName>, king of <placeName key="tgn,2032421" n="1.000 10" reg="Judah, Lawrence, Indiana">Judah</placeName>, and unto all the house of <persName n="Judah,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Judah,nomatch:0"><surname>Judah</surname></persName> and <persName n="Benjamin,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="nearbymention:Benjamin,J.,P.,,"><surname>Benjamin</surname></persName>, and to the remnant of the people, saying, Thus saith the <rs>Lord</rs>, ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren, the children of <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName>.&#x0022;--We are, therefore, unable to see anything in the <rs n="Jewish" type="religion">Hebrew</rs> Constitution, or the administration thereof, which entitles the <name>Sons</name> of the <name>Pilgrims</name> to consider themselves the chosen people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>There is nothing in common between the <num value="2">two</num> except those peculiar sins of the children of <persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName> which induced the <name>Almighty</name> to cut them off, at last, from among the nations. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> The <orgName n="New York Times" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> has a delectable article entitled &#x0022;The Wrangling of the <rs>Rebels</rs> in the <name>Hour</name> of Ruin.&#x0022; It asserts that its files of rebel newspapers are filled with the most extraordinary outbursts of fury against the rebel authorities, and the most vivid pictures of the moral and political chaos that now prevails in the <rs>South</rs>. &#x0022;There is a perfect uproar in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The maledictions and the hatred that have for years been directed against the <rs>North</rs> are now, in the hour of their despair and ruin, directed against their own leaders, authorities, generals and armies.&#x0022; &#x0022;The quarrelling which is going on in the <rs>South</rs> at this crisis is a very bad sign for the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>It is certainly a bad state of mind for the rebels of <placeName reg="Carolina City, Carteret, North Carolina" key="tgn,2222249">Carolina</placeName> and <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to be in, in view of <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>It is the demoralization of spirit which might be expected to follow such a crushing series of defeats as the rebels have lately suffered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>The disaster at <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName> will increase it, and other blows we hope soon to give must make it still worse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>It looks as if this rebellion would break up, as many other rebellions and revolutions have broken up, by a ferocious wrangle, if not a bloody strife, among those who were its originators and supporters.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/> The concern of the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> over this sad state of affairs will, we hope, be relieved by its next intelligence from the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Its files will now inform it of a different kind of &#x0022;uproar,&#x0022; which, we hope, will cheer its drooping spirits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/> Since writing to you on yesterday, notwithstanding the severe snow and sleet which now bids fair to put an end to military operations on these lines, there has been an almost continuous engagement near <persName n="Hatcher,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00184" reg="mostcommon:Hatcher,nomatch:0"><surname>Hatcher</surname></persName>'s run. Shortly after writing yesterday morning, our division (<persName n="Gordon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00185" reg="mostcommon:Gordon,nomatch:0"><surname>Gordon</surname></persName>'s) was ordered back to camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>All were congratulating themselves that the movement was over, and were preparing warm dinners, when suddenly orders came to move at once.--Many a poor soldier looked back with disappointment at his dough just ready for the oven, or his peas, not yet boiling briskly; yet they moved off cheerfully, and soon came up to the assistance of <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00186" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Andy,,,"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName> of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> troops, who were on picket opposite the point at which, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, our picket line was captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>This brigade acted nobly; and although the enemy advanced in force upon their picket line with <num value="2">two</num> whole corps, they held their ground until reinforced by <persName n="Evans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00187" reg="mostcommon:Evans,nomatch:0"><surname>Evans</surname></persName>'s and <orgName n="divisions"><persName n="Pegram,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00188" reg="mostcommon:Pegram,nomatch:0"><surname>Pegram</surname></persName>'s divisions</orgName>, of <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Gordon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00189" reg="mostcommon:Gordon,nomatch:0"><surname>Gordon</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName>, who marched from camp, a distance of near <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure>, after the advance of the enemy was known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>The contest for some time was varying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>The enemy occupied temporary breastworks parallel with Moccasin <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>; but when <orgName n="command"><persName n="Gordon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00190" reg="mostcommon:Gordon,nomatch:0"><surname>Gordon</surname></persName>'s command</orgName> arrived upon the field they had advanced some distance beyond them. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>Once a portion of their works was carried, but, not being supported either on the right or left, they were soon lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>We held the field; and although the enemy had confronted us all day with <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 2">two corps</orgName> and a part of <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num>, it is sufficient to know that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00192" reg="mostcommon:Lee,R.,E.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> was in person on the field, and that his watchful eye, by the help of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, will detect any movement in time to be prepared to meet it with telling effect whenever and wherever they may see fit to advance. </p>
