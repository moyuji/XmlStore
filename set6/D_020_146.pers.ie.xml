<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/> --It is the warm sun that brings out the adder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>The splendid season of dry weather that we had for <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> has hardened the earth, restored the roads, prepared the way for a grand advance of the enemy wherever he is in force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>It is almost incredible that he will refuse to avail himself of the auspices which thus smooth his path.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>The untoward affair on <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> last at <placeName reg="Drainsville">Drainsville</placeName> will probably inspire his soldiers with some confidence in themselves, and conspire with the excellent roads to invite an advance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/> It is said that <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00153" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> has repeatedly given orders for a forward movement upon our lines, and that as many troops as could be used upon the fields before <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> have been for sometime on this side of the <rs>Potomac</rs>, and that nothing has prevented a grand battle long before now but the absolute impossibility of inducing the reluctant and timid <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> to move forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>The disgraceful and disastrous defeat they received at <placeName reg="Leesburg, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2112647">Leesburg</placeName> filled them with dismay, and has rendered a forward movement with men thus stricken with fear and distrust impossible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/> The affair at <placeName reg="Drainsville">Drainsville</placeName>, has probably taught them, however, that, odds being in their favor, it is possible to defeat and drive back Southern troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>If it should have this effect, and should thus induce a forward movement by <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00154" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, this <placeName reg="Drainsville">Drainsville</placeName> <hi rend="italics">contretemps</hi> will really prove <num value="1">one</num> of the most fortunate occurrences of the war. Our army only ask for a fair fight in open-field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>If the enemy will but come forward far enough to afford the chance of a decisive battle, that is all our <rs type="role" reg="General">Generals</rs> of their men desire or ask. This granted, they will take care of the feat; and it is much to be hoped that the rampant politicians in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> will be able by the leverage which this <placeName reg="Drainsville">Drainsville</placeName> business will give them to force <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00155" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> into the field. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/> Trusting to a large superiority of numbers the enemy seem steadily to be pushing forward their troops in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> for an attack in force upon our army under <persName n="Johnston,General,Sydney,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00156" reg="default:Johnston,Sydney,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <foreName>Sydney</foreName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>From all the indications in that quarter, a grand engagement within a few days seems unavoidable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>Thus circumstances all combine to bring about <num value="2">two</num> great engagements on either side of <placeName reg="Allegheny Mountains" key="tgn,7020004" type="mountainrange">the Alleghanies</placeName>, which, but for the relations of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> to the <rs>North</rs>, would be decisive of the war. If the <rs>South</rs> should be beaten on both fields, she could hardly expect for some time to get together <num value="2">two</num> armies of any magnitude; and would have to depend altogether upon the virtues of a Fabian policy, and a general system of skirmishing against the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>If the <rs>South</rs>, on the other hand, should <hi rend="italics">gain</hi> both battles, the <rs>North</rs> would be compelled to desist from aggressive measures for such length of time as it would require to organize and discipline other new armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>Considering the low state of their exchequer, the period required for this purpose would be so long that a virtual suspension of invasion would be the result, and the <rs>South</rs> would be enabled to carry invasion to their own doors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>Such an invasion, though only partially successful would virtually end the war; especially if it resulted in stampeding the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs> from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/> The appearance of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> on the field of strife would have a decided influence upon the contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> effect of the imbroglio, even if it should not result in war between that country and the <rs>North</rs>, must be to precipitate the latter in whatever action it may have been preparing against the <rs>South</rs>, during the last few months of busy activity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>An attack upon our armies in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and on the <rs>Potomac</rs> might otherwise have been postponed until the spring; but the complication with <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> must at once determine the administration to strike its blow without delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>A successful battle upon the <rs>Potomac</rs> and in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, might avert a war with <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>; for a defeat by the <rs>South</rs> on these <num value="2">two</num> fields, would be taken by the world as conclusive proof of her inability to make good her independence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/> Thus all the circumstances of the hour unite to force on <num value="2">two</num> great battles in the next few days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>To refuse to fight under the influences now pressing upon it, would argue an imbecility in the <rs>North</rs>, its <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, and its armies, which could not fail to be interpreted most unfavorably against that section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>Such a failure ought to produce a total loss of confidence in the <rs>Lincoln</rs> administration among its own people; and that would most probably be the real effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>Both the <rs>North</rs> itself, and more particularly the administration in power, are impelled to offer battle at this moment by necessities which seem to us as imperative as irresistible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>They <hi rend="italics">must</hi> fight; and we are ready for the fray.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>The defiant cry of the whole <rs>South</rs> is, <q>&#x0022;Lay on Macduff.&#x0022;</q> </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>They have no more idea of freeing the negroes and permitting them to remain here, than they have of permitting them to migrate to the <rs>North</rs>.--The people of the <rs>South</rs> have never yet begun to conceive of the utter disgust and antipathy of the <rs>Northern</rs> people for the negro, physically.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>Notwithstanding their fine philanthropic talk, they never tire of laughing at the physical peculiarities of <q>&#x0022;Cuffie,&#x0022;</q> and of cracking miserable jokes about his big feet, bender shins, wooly hair, and remarkable odor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>Strange as it may appear, it is nevertheless true, that no people on the face of the earth have such profound and irreconcilable repugnance and loathing for the ebony race as those who pretend to be its peculiar champions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>In addition to this antipathy and disgust for the <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> as a man, there is a universal and undeniable conviction in the <rs>North</rs> that <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> labor is the most costly of all labor; that there is less work and greater expenditure, both in pay and waste, than any other kind of labor in Christendom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>They believe religiously that <num value="1">one</num> white man can do the work of <num value="3">three</num> negroes, and do it better and more cheaply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>Hence, they never dream of permitting the negro to remain in the <rs>South</rs> after they have made him free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>He is to be sent out of the country, and white laborer to take his place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>This is <num value="1">one</num> of the most popular of <orgName n="Yankee Notions" type="newspaper">Yankee notions</orgName>, and it is being gradually developed by <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00157" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/> <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> colonization, an exploded humbug, is revived again under the auspices of that prolific source of humbugs, the <rs>Washington Administration</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>We want no better evidence on the subject than has been collected by George Francis Train himself, the very man who has become notorious of late in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> by his abuse and denunciation of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>In a work published in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> only last year, in which Train undertook to show that the <rs>North</rs> and <rs>England</rs> profited most by slave labor, initiated the slave trade, and has done nothing for the real benefit of the negro, he considers the subject of colonization, and demonstrates its utter impracticability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>The cost thus far from the organization of the <orgName n="American Colonization Society" type="society">American Colonization Society</orgName> in <dateStruct value="1817--"><year reg="1817">1817</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct> for the little negro colony in <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName> is <measure n="1950238.71dollars" type="currency">$1,950,238.71</measure>. <q>&#x0022;All this expense,&#x0022;</q> exclaims the author, &#x0022;and for what good?
