<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/> --The news of this morning is indicative of serious work near at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>At <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> the enemy seeing the damage sustained by <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> (a fort which our batteries of guns greatly inferior to those now used by the enemy, silenced in a few hours,) from their <num value="1000">thousands</num> of ponderous missiles, had demanded the surrender of the city, and of <placeName reg="Morris Island, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2525074">Morris Island</placeName>. <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00140" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>'s reply was worthy of him. The enemy understands from it that <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> is not taken, and that he has much more digging and bombarding and fighting to do before he can take it, if he ever takes it at all, which is altogether improbable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>Let <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName> be razed to a mass of rubbish there yet remain obstacles far more serious than <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName> in the enemy's way. If he gets <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> at all it will cost him dearly; and when he does he will more likely conquer a city in ruins!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>The <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, we believe, has brought itself to the determination not to abandon cities upon a threat of the enemy that unless they are given up they will be shelled &mdash; simply to save the <hi rend="italics">houses!</hi> It is found to be only giving up comfortable quarters to the enemy, while all of our own people who remain in them are persecuted and abused like dogs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>None of their rights of property are respected, while personally they are not accorded the ordinary usages of humanity, much less those of common civility and decency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>All eyes are upon <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>She is far yet from falling and triumph or fall, we know that her defenders are about to illuminate our history by another chapter that will excite the admiration of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>Her example will be invaluable to our people and a warning to the enemy, who will have a fearful admonition of terrible resistance they must continue to meet in their war of invasion and subjugation of the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/> The <rs>Southwest</rs> is becoming again the theatre of interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/><persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00141" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> is said to be advancing upon <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00142" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName>; while in the <name>West Burnside</name> is pressing upon <persName n="Buckner,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00143" reg="mostcommon:Buckner,nomatch:0"><surname>Buckner</surname></persName>, who holds <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>This is probably all the better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>The effect of our campaign beyond the <rs>Potomac</rs> and the loss of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> is that the enemy presses us, and it is when we are pressed that we achieve results worthy of the cause and the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>The danger of too much success on our side has always been too much confidence and the relapsing into carelessness and apathy.--We grow listless, and our men pine in inactivity and die rapidly from camp diseases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>Fewer would perish on the battlefields of an active campaign. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/> The enemy has suffered heavily of late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>At <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName> his loss was greatly more than ours; at <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> and <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName> his loss was greatly more than all the men he captured from us in those places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>Nor were his losses terminated with the capture of those places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>Disease &mdash; yellow fever and camp fever &mdash; has been rapidly killing his men ever since.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>The movement of <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00144" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> &mdash; if he has, indeed, begun a march &mdash; is <num value="1">one</num> of desperation possibly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>The immense losses from disease in the <rs>Federal</rs> army may urge him to do something at once before his army is too feeble to hold its position, much less to advance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/> A week or <num value="2">two</num> will bring us, we believe, news to cheer us. There is no good reason now for despondency; for the situation since this time last year is not much altered to our disadvantage.--A single victory in the <rs>Southwest</rs> will recover much that we have lost there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>The strong position in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName> can hardly be lost to us. Here in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> the enemy is further from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> than he was last year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>Should <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> fall he cannot make headway into the interior, and will only be able to close that place as a port of entry. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/> So the situation brightens, because it shows signs of activity, and that is grateful to the brave Confederate soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>We have always gotten along better when the enemy showed fight than when he delayed his movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>We have generally repelled his attacks successfully, while we have not failed to attack him when he gave us the opportunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>We have carried his field fortifications &mdash; he has never, save very partially, carried ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>Let him come on then &mdash; our men will meet him cheerfully; and they will beat him, too, unless the programme of past campaigns is greatly changed for the <num value="1">one</num> just coming. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>If the <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> believes, however, in cover earnest, that we are a &#x0022;crushed&#x0022;,people why is <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00146" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> pushing his draft with such desperation?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>If half a <num value="1000000">million</num> or more of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> troops, now in the field, are not enough to hold a crushed people down, and <num value="300000">three hundred thousand</num> additional have to be added, we should say that &#x0022;crushing&#x0022; is but the smallest and cheapest preliminary to the work of subjugation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have escaped destruction at <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName>, and they have taken <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, and this they call crushing the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>What would they have said, what crazy fools would they have made of themselves, if they had gained as many triumphs as the <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>Do they imagine that we have less constancy, courage and endurance than themselves?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>If they can persevere in a bad cause after a score of defeats, do they suppose that we shall give up home, country and independence after <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> reverses?
