<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>His railroad communication with <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName> is cut off by the movement of <persName n="Longstreet,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00216" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>, whose corps occupies <placeName reg="Lookout Mountain, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100143">Lookout Mountain</placeName>, below <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, and on the right of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>The railroad runs at the base of this mountain, between it and the river, and is therefore completely in <persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00217" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>'s power.
