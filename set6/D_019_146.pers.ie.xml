<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Our <num value="4">four</num> companies here are in good health, and very much pleased with the encampment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>We have a delightful time, consisting chiefly in bathing, sleeping in the shade and drinking buttermilk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>This is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> glimpse of the bright side of the picture of camp life we have had since we left old <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>; but our dream is Hable to be broken at any hour by the fierce din of strife, for such is the fortune of war; yet, should we be aroused from our sweet slumbers, we will quickly put aside the pleasing remnant of each departed dream, and meet our enemy in a spirit which becomes the children of free-men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> Our encampment is surrounded by woods and trees where from each bough some gentle songster warbles his trumpet notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>We also have in our immediate neighborhood several springs of excellent water, the greatest friend of the soldier, (save <num value="1">one</num>) A good number of our brief taking advantage of the convenient situation of our camp, have obtained furloughs and gone to see their relatives and friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Your humble correspondent does not want a furlough at present, but would rather wait and get <num value="1">one</num> in which there is no prescribed limit of time, (you will readily surmise the kind I refer to).

We hope they will renew their visits as often as possible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> We have now been here better than a week, and have not done anything except to have the usual dress parades, so we have had a glorious rest, which we very much needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>I am almost afraid if we remain here much longer there will be a disposition to become lazy, a supposition to such extent would be quite plausible now.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>I understand, through a very reliable source, that the <rs>Federal</rs> army, stationed at their stronghold, <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>, have a sick list of about <num value="5000">5,000</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>This is the number of these who are bodily sick; those who are sick mentally doubtless exceed the number I have stated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The weather which we have had here for several days would kill an army of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> in marching <measure n="10miles" type="distance">ten miles</measure>. without requiring the expenditure of our bullets. </p>

This is no time for dissention; let us hear from headquarters what we are to do in such a dilemma, and all companies made in different counties. </p>
