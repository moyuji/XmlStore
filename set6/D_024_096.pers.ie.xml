<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>A short time since a man who had been stripped of everything and who could scarcely articulate for weeping, appealed to the writer of the letter for advice <unclear></unclear> to what course he should pursue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/> Several Federal journals intimate that no active hostilities on their part need be expected this spring, but that the <rs>North</rs> will stand on the defensive till autumn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>Various reasons are assigned for this important modification of the &#x0022;short-sharp, and decisive&#x0022; It is alleged that the <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> men, embracing a large number of their most efficient soldiers, will soon be discharged, and that their army generally is not in a condition to <unclear> </unclear> the aggressive, whilst the <rs>Southern</rs> army, on the other hand was never in a more efficient state, both as regards discipline and numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>It is further asserted that the raise and bad roads of this season in the <rs>South</rs> forbid a spring campaign, whilst summer operations, they have learned by experience are not to be thought of. During the summer they can gather in and drill their new conscripts, and by autumn be prepared to take the field once more and crush the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>In the meantime their great hope is that the <rs>South</rs> will suffer from want of food and be so financially strangulated that, when the hour of battle comes we shall not be able to stand up against the over whelming masses of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>They profess, also, to believe that, rather than wants the interval in inaction, we shall attack them in their strongholds, when they will have all the advantages of a defensive position, and we shall suffer as they have whenever they have been the assailants. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/> Whether a particle of confidence ought to be placed in these prognostications, we leave to those who can see through the murky waters of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> deception to the bottom, to decide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>Our Government and our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> understand too thoroughly the army, tortuous ways of Yankeedom, to be put off their guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>All this may be only a prelude to some sudden and desperate rush of the <rs>Federal</rs> armies at a vital point of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>It is impossible for us to put faith in anything these people say. It seems improbable that, if they intended to remain inactive during the <rs type="season">spring</rs> and <rs type="season">summer</rs>, they would inform us of it. Their real object, therefore, may be to full us into a dream of security, and spring upon us as we sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>If, however, their armies are so disorganized and demoralized that they cannot push on till next fall, what becomes of the late emphatic declarations of the New York <hi rend="italics">Tribunes,</hi> that if the rebels were not conquered in <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>, the <rs>North</rs> might as well give up the contest; and the threat of the <hi rend="italics">Herald,</hi> that unless the rebellion were crushed before fall, <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00153" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and his Cabinet ought to be impeached?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>Can the <rs>North</rs> afford to wait <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>, with an enormous debt rolling up mountain high every day, on the fragile hope that the <rs>South</rs> will be starved or whipped out next fall?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>What reason have they to calculate on the <rs>South</rs> being starved out?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>Even if our condition were now as close on the borders of famine as their journals represent, how do they know but the same beneficent <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> which has hither to go interposed wonderfully in our behalf will not crown the labors of our husbandmen with plenty, and give us abundant harvests?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>As to their congesting us by any other mode than starvation, we do not believe they themselves after the experience of the past have the slightest confidence in such an achievement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>If they wait till fall they need not expect that the <rs>North</rs> will be the only party prepared for the conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>The South will avail itself of every hour of the interval to multiply its means of defence, till every hillside becomes a <unclear></unclear>, and every valley a valley of the shadow of death to the invaders. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
