<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/> When the commanders of opposing armies desire to communicate with each other, either for an exchange of prisoners, the burial of the dead, or the safe passage of non-combatants through their lines, or for any other purpose, it can only be done under a flag of truce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>The party bearing the flag may consist of <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="50">fifty</num> men, as the case may be, who are usually mounted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>If the object be to convey a written communication, a small party only is sent with it. If it be to conduct prisoners through the lines, then the number of the escort or guard depends upon the number of prisoners to be delivered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>The party is always accompanied by an officer, whose duty it is to deliver the letter, or turn over the prisoners under his charge. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/> Having passed beyond their own lines, the party proceed in the following order: <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> comes a man on horseback, with a white flag in his hand, which he continues to wave, in order to attract the attention of the enemy's pickets and prevent them from firing upon him through mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>By his side is another man, also mounted, who is provided with a bugle or trumpet, which he continues to blow incessantly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>This is called <q>&#x0022;sounding a parley.&#x0022;</q> The object is to notify the adversary of your approach, and of your desire to communicate with him &mdash; Literally, <hi rend="italics">to talk with him.</hi>--Next follow the officer, bearing the dispatch, and the escort, some <num value="50">fifty</num> or <num value="60">sixty</num> paces in the rear of the flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>When the party have reached the lines of the other side, they are halted until word can be sent forward to the officer in command of the forces at that point, or they are conducted to his headquarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>Arrived there, the object of the visit is explained, and the letter or prisoners delivered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>If the business be such that only the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">commander-in-chief</rs> can attend to it, then the communication is forwarded immediately to him, who either returns an answer at once, or promises to do so at an early period. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/> During the pendency of the negotiations and the time necessarily consumed in going and coming, there is a temporary cessation of hostilities &mdash; a truce &mdash; between the party bearing the flag and opposing force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>And hence, the flag under which the negotiations are conducted is called a flag of truce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>It is regarded as highly improper for either party to take advantage of this necessary intercourse to examine the works of the other, or to pry into his condition, or to receive secret intelligence from any of his disaffected troops, or to approach them with corrupt propositions. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>In accordance with this belief, we have chosen to separate ourselves from States who had long ago broken with impunity that national compact which they would hold us to by fire and sword.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>The <rs>North</rs> professed to be the model people of humanity and toleration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>They were so morbidly compassionate to human suffering that they could scarcely bear to consign to the gallows the most bloody murderers and pirates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>In several of their States capital punishment had been abolished, and it was their boast that no political offender had ever lost his life in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>Moreover, even if all this could have been imagined, we should have been told that the cool reason and proverbial calculating qualities of the <rs>North</rs> would have instinctively revolted against the process of preserving the <rs>Union</rs> by a war of invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>The vast revenues which they derived from the <rs>South</rs> would have been an appeal to the pocket which would instantly have settled the question in favor of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>We should have been told that they were the last people upon earth to cut open the goose that laid them the golden eggs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>It was the <rs>South</rs> that supplied the <rs>General Government</rs> the greatest portion of its increase, it was Southern staples and Southern labor which built up Northern commerce and manufactures, and made their cities vast hives of industry and wealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>Disunion did not necessarily involve the loss of these advantages; if peaceably affected, it is more than probable that trade would still have continued in its accustomed channels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>The <rs>North</rs>, as a reasoning and calculating people, might have been expected to prefer the chances of peace, and even of ultimate reconstruction, to the loss of everything which a war of invasion would render inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>The people who cheered on rebellion in every other land, have pursued it here with a wild cry for subjugation or-extermination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>The nation which permitted such an abomination as <placeName reg="Utah, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007827">Utah</placeName> to flaunt the flag of rebellion defiantly in its very face, have raised an army of <num value="700000">seven hundred thousand</num> men to obliterate from the very face of the earth, if they can, the <rs>Christian</rs> and civilized South.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>It shows that their capabilities are very much magnified, and that they are not the all powerful and irresistible things many prominent persons even at the <rs>South</rs> have regarded them to be. The lesson taught at the obstruction in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName> by our <num value="3">three</num>-gun battery has helped to dispel the delusion that had prevailed on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>It is clear that the enemy can never reach <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> by the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>I will state a few facts:--Horizontal, or rather direct shell firing, as from <persName n="Dahlgren,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00112" reg="mostcommon:Dahlgren,nomatch:0"><surname>Dahlgren</surname></persName> or rifled pieces, is destructive only to shipping or beddings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>It has very little effect upon batteries, either with or without parapets, or upon troops deployed &mdash; This is due, I think, partly to the difficulty of causing the shell, even if well directed, to explode exactly at the object, but chiefly to the great velocity of the missile, which carries the fragments after explosion beyond the point of bursting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>Mortar firing, or vertical fire, as it is called, is, if well managed, much more destructive and dangerous, in that the velocity is small and the explosive force has full play.
