<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/> The <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName> has <num value="1">one</num> of its characteristic sneers at the willingness expressed by <persName n="Buren,,John,,,Van" id="n-0001.0000.00000.00320" reg="expanded:Buren,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <nameLink>Van</nameLink> <surname>Buren</surname></persName>, if the <rs>Federal</rs> should capture <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, and the <rs>South</rs> should still refuse to come under the <rs>Union</rs>, to endorse the language once expressed by <persName n="Scott,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00321" reg="mostcommon:Scott,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Scott</surname></persName>, <q>&#x0022;Wayward sisters, depart in peace.&#x0022;</q> Nothing will satisfy the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> but the complete and thorough subjugation of the <rs>Southern States</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>So it will be to the end. Peace now, late as it is, is a better policy for the <rs>North</rs> than war.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/> It must be evident enough by this time, to the most uncompromising coercionists, that their policy annihilated the <rs>Union</rs> sentiment of the <rs>South</rs> the moment it was adopted, and that every hour the war has continued has put the <num value="2">two</num> people further and further apart, until now there is a gulf between them as wide and impassable as that between <persName n="Lazarus,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00322" reg="mostcommon:Lazarus,nomatch:0"><surname>Lazarus</surname></persName> and <persName n="Dives,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00323" reg="mostcommon:Dives,nomatch:0"><surname>Dives</surname></persName>.
