<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>That here he was determined to make a stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>That his force consisted only of <num value="1700">1,700</num> infantry and artillery, and that the enemy was alleged to be <num value="15000">15,000</num> strong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>That this he did not believe, but that his men must be prepared to fight <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> or several to <num value="1">one</num>, and even if the enemy was in the full force represented, the position admitted of successful defence, and he was determined to abide the issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>Really, the distinction between the <num value="2">two</num> parties rests almost exclusively on the manner of regarding the slavery question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>The <orgName n="Republican party" type="party">Republican party</orgName> of later date, without exactly inscribing on its banner the principle of the abolition of slavery, has a manifest tendency to seek that result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>The skillful men of the party are far from acknowledging that pretension, but its adventures and reckless members (<foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">les enjantes terribles</hi></foreign>) do not make any concealment of it.
