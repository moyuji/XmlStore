To such a creature as be is death is no doubt the greatest of sorrow for it introduces him to the punishment which such miscreants do not always receive in this life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Even exiles from a conquered land may appear to him a frightful calamity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Doubtless, if Massachuset were overrun by a race as repugnant in all respects to her people as are the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> to the <rs>South</rs>, <persName n="Phillips,,Wendell,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="default:Phillips,Wendell,,,"><foreName>Wendell</foreName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName> would prefer to remain in it, and kiss the feet of the conqueror, court their favor and tremble at their frowns, rather than breathe the free air in a foreign land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>But men is not the spirit of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>We have heard our brave women say, with tears in their eyes that they would rather die than behold the subjugation of their native land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>And where such is the spirit of the women, the men cannot be expected to be actuated by purposes <persName n="Lars,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Lars,nomatch:0"><surname>Lars</surname></persName> lofty and resolves less inflexible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> And as to &#x0022;exile,&#x0022; is the event of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> conquest, what would it be, but freedom &#x0022;from daily contact with the things we loathe?&#x0022; We do not underrate the love of our native land; but dear to its people as is every foot of its entered rail every noble mountain and beautiful river, bellowed as it is by grand historic and honest old traditions, made precious by all the memories of youth, friendship, love, and hope, and made dearer even by the burning tribulations through which it has passed, her people would rather live in any land under Heaven than to abide in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> after it has ceased to be their own. When the time comes when all that constitutes <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, except the rocks and earth, ceases to exist; when her social and political frame-work passes away; when cold-blooded, nasal <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> vulgarians have cut up the large estates of her proprietors into <num value="10">ten</num>-acre lots, with a <num value="2">two</num>- story while frame houses on each, with gingerbread and apples in the window and a codfish or <num value="2">two</num> drying on the clothes line, and filling the wide air with their balmy fragrance; when our cities are filled with <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> traders and manufacturers, and our frank and gentle <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> women have given place to affected blue stockings and &#x0022;strong minded&#x0022; women, when <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> laws, morality, philosophy, and philanthropy, have pervaded and dominated over all <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, and the children of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> can no longer remain here except as aliens in their native land, beggars in the midst of their own possessions, and slaves to those whom they scorn and execrate from the profoundest depths of their souls, death would be a deliverer, and exile a blessing, for which we could not be too grateful. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Exile has no terrors compared with the intolerable degradation of being subjugated by <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>It is hard to give up <num value="1">one</num>'s native land; but, in our own country, men often voluntarily relinquish it for the more purposes of enterprise and money making.

<head><rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> intervention.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> Every true Southern man must be gratified that the illusion of <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> intervention has disappeared &mdash; that the gay bubble has burst &mdash; and that we no longer occupy the humiliating attitude of supplicants for <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> favor An independent national existence achieved by such aid would be in reality the most degrading provincialism, and leave in our own minds a series of obligation and dependence which would embitter all the fruits of victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The world at large would feel no respect for a people who had not the strength to vindicate their own cause, and who were willing to accept as a boon from others what they had not the capacity to achieve for themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>In addition to the damaging moral effect of such a position, we should be compelled to give an equivalent for the assistance and protection rendered us, which would be as hard a bargain as shrewd diplomatists could wring from the necessities that required their aid. We have been ourselves ready to give them in consideration of their help, our whole commerce and manufactures and our entire coasting trade &mdash; concessions which would have reduced us to the condition of the <rs>East</rs> <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> provinces of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, and left us with nothing but a bare nominal existence among nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>What is a nation without commerce and manufacture?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Exactly what the <rs>South</rs> has been under the old Union--a mere dependency, and tributary of that people by whom its commerce and manufactures are absorbed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Indeed, we had some advantages under the old <hi rend="italics">regime,</hi> such as representation in the <rs>Government</rs> which reduced us to this condition, which we should not enjoy if tributaries of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> or <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The influence of both Governments, moreover, would be always adverse to our domestic institutions, that of the former especially, whose <placeName reg="Exeter Hall">Exeter Hall</placeName> philanthropy has fomented the fanaticism of the <rs>North</rs> for the last half century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>This would be the smallest price we should have to pay for foreign intervention, and we might be thankful if it did not end in converting us into nominal as well as real provinces of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>From such a degradation we have been saved by the persistent refusal of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> to interfere in the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> quarrel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>It has, also, delivered us from maternal chronic hostility with the <rs>North</rs>, which, if we should achieve our independence by foreign aid, would always taunt us with our own weakness, and be ever on the alert to the advantage of it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> When the interests of <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> nations require them to break the blockade, they will break it; but not from regard to us, but themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Northing that we can say or do will after that policy, except that it may be hastened and rendered certain by a vigorous and prolonged assertion of our rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>But when is comes, it will be from no love of us, and <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> will establish no claims upon our gratitude.--It will come as a necessity to them, not a favor to us, and will entitle them to no commercial or manufacturing or any other advantages at our hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>We shall achieve our own independence, we shall foster and encourage our own industry, we shall carry our own products in our own ships; in <num value="1">one</num> word, we shall become a power of the earth in reality as well as in name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>We have a higher ambition than simply to be whacked off from the clutches of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Eagle by the tail of the <rs>British Lion</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>We have a higher ambition than peace purchased at the price of vassal age to any Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> Sojourning for a while at this place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>I know no way of employing a few hours to more advantage than in giving you a few items &#x0022;by the wayside.&#x0022; What a contrast between this city and busy, bustling <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>All the difference in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>It is true, the <name>Barbarian</name> arm of martial law is alike extended over both places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Armed squads of soldiers parade the streets; but here they are reward far between.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The work to be performed is limited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>No extensive programme of daily arrests is so be seen as with you; but the steady, onward, tranquil move of both military and civil affairs distinguish the face of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Not that the visitors or citizens excel those of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> in moral culture or enlightened behavior, is it to be reckoned that reckoned that this variance in the local items of the <num value="2">two</num> places exist; but amply from the fact that <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> is thronged, &#x0022;full to overflowing,&#x0022; with hangers on around the official functionaries of our land; with staunch civilians from every hamlets, city, and town of the <rs>South</rs>; with the proud and chivalrous soldiery composing our army, who, having bid good-bye to friends and acquaintances, are fleeing again to the banner of freedom on the field of action. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> To <num value="1">one</num> just entering <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, fresh from the stir of the great Southern <placeName key="tgn,2029059" n="1.000 4" reg="metropolis, massac, illinois">Metropolis</placeName>, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> task of the mind is that of digesting the vivid differences of color between a land deluged with the ring of war steel and <num value="1">one</num> wrapped in the pinions of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>It is true, <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> is folded in the mantle which enshrouds the whole <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Yet the tranquil, quiet nature of the place is strikingly consentaneous with the general died of our cities and towns ere this holy conflict began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Hence we are more forcibly reminded of the blessings of former days, on tasting the balm of seeming case and cheerfulness emanating from this place, after a rest in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>; still the tide of business is dull and turbid, compared with that surrounding you. The streets are, however, occasionally emended with the heavy tramp of martial legions --the militia &mdash; hastening on to meet the further issuance of order, under the direct supervision of <persName n="Huger,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Huger,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Huger</surname></persName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> Our militia force is numerous, and will render important service to our cause, if properly disciplined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>War is purely a science.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Any corps of men may be taught to fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>The militia have ever been regarded as of inferior grid; but the sole and principal cause of their conduct on many occasions, heretofore, is attributable to the limited extent of discipline attached to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>To make them an effective arm of defence, they must be drilled, and interested in the art of war. It is not reasonable to expect that a farmer, fresh from the plow, placed in the capacity of a physician, will discharge the duties of his new position with success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Norther is it reasonable, or even presumable, that the militia, unacquainted with the usages of war, will make as good soldiers as the well-trained volunteers, until instructed in that art.
