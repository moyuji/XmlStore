<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> We give below the letters of the correspondents of the <hi rend="italics">Dispatch</hi> at <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington, North Carolina</placeName>, both of which would have been received some days since but for the interruptions in the mails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>They will be found very interesting. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, rumors of an impending attack upon this place were again current, and, as usual, caused no little excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The alarm bell was rung and the citizens, called to arms; but no <num value="1">one</num> could tell from what point the danger was apprehended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>At last, the reports began to come in, and we learned a fleet of <num value="60">sixty</num> sail had left <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName> for the avowed purpose of making an attack upon the forts and the defences at the mouth of the <rs type="place">Cape Fear</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>At the same time, it was said further, a force of <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num> men, under <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>, had landed somewhere in the <rs>Roanoke</rs> or <rs>Neuse</rs> rivers, and was preparing to march upon this city by land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The best information from scouts, and also from <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, seemed to confirm these reports. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, at an early hour, the fleet came off <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName>--<placeName reg="New Inlet, Northampton, Virginia" key="tgn,2539328">New inlet</placeName> &mdash; and in a short time <num value="30">thirty</num> vessels, of all classes, were in sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Among them the <rs>Wabash</rs> and <placeName reg="Colorado" key="tgn,7007158">Colorado</placeName> were recognized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Throughout the day great activity was noticeable, the square-rigged vessels being busy in lowering their topsail yards, housing spars and clearing away for action; and it was expected they would engage the forts at high tide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The day went by, however, without any movement on their part beyond the preparations mentioned; nor was anything farther heard from the land force higher up the coast. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> During the night a gale arose outside, blowing on shore, and this morning it is terrific.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Such a storm has not been felt here for some years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Nothing more favorable could have occurred; and it seemed as if the special hand of an over-ruling <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> was in it. When I went out, the wind blew fearfully.--Houses swayed to and fro, loosened shingles sailed through the air, and the blinding dust flew in dense clouds, filling mouth, eyes and cars, and almost suffocating the struggling pedestrian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The trees bent and rocked, while the leaves flew in drifts and the dead limbs fell to the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Many fences in the town were levelled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>In the river, the sight was more interesting and reminded <num value="1">one</num> of those lively marine pictures of <persName n="Turner,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Turner,nomatch:0"><surname>Turner</surname></persName>, or the sketches in the harbors of Osteoid and <persName n="Boulogne,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Boulogne,nomatch:0"><surname>Boulogne</surname></persName> by the <rs>French</rs> artists <unclear></unclear> the same school.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The waves ran high and drifted rapidly in. The ferry-boats were nearly swamped; and all the vessels in the harbor had to be securely fastened to the wharf, while, on deck, everything was lashed as in a gale at sea. The smaller steamers had to get up steam in case they broke loosed from their moorings, and the <term type="ship">receiving ship</term> <rs type="ship">Arctic</rs> (<persName n="Kane,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Kane,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Kane</surname></persName>'s old ship) drifted her anchors, and had to be bound, head and stern, to the shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>From <num value="6">six</num> to <num value="8">eight</num>, the wind increased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/><num value="8">Eight</num>, <num value="9">nine</num>, <num value="10">ten</num>, it continued to blow fearfully, threatening to unroof the houses and uproot the trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>In addition to the dust and small particles of sand, that struck against <num value="1">one</num>'s face like bird shot, the air was white with feculent cotton whirling in fantastic circles like pallen or thistle down upon a summer breeze.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Large crowds gathered under the lee of corner buildings and watched the singular sights, while the dandies twirled their mustaches in store doors, keeping an eye out for neatly turned ankles, and &mdash; ankles; but few of the fairer sex dared the raving blast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>A gang of teal attempted to beat up the wind, but, making no progress for half an hour, finally plunged into the river; a bevy of school girls tried to walk up the street, but failing, turned and scudded before the wind to a place of safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/><time value="11oclock">Eleven o'clock</time>, the barometer sinks; <num value="12">twelve</num>, and the air grows heavy, while drops of rain begin to fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>At <num value="1">one</num>, came a shower, and even in mid-winter was heard low muttering thunder, like the roll of distant artillery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> Of course, with such a gale within the precincts of a town with forests around and a background of hills upon an unbroken stretch of sea, it must have been more sensibly felt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Within the ground <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> swell it was always impossible for a vessel to lay, and, <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num>, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> ran out to sea under easy steam, with everything taut on board, guns lashed and close-furled canvass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>But a few of them remain in sight this evening.--What could have occurred more favorable to us than this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>For days and days back it has been very warm and pleasant, and the river and harbor almost as placid as a lake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Now, at the very moment the enemy is preparing to attack us, a fearful storm arises and scatters their armada, knocking up such a sea it is impossible for troops to land or to work the guns against our works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>This delay gives us time to bring up troops and complete the preparations for defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>It seems almost a special interposition of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> &mdash; as much so as when the waters of the <placeName reg="Red Sea" key="tgn,7016791">Red sea</placeName> receded miles and miles to permit the passage of the <rs n="Jewish" type="religion">Jewish</rs> host, and the returning tide came on to engulf their pursuers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>With this material aid from on high, if proper preparations for defence are not made, the place deserves to fall. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> And about its defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>In a previous letter I have spoken of the defences of the <rs type="place">Cape Fear</rs>, and remarked they seemed to be admirably situated and strong enough to resist any assault made upon them <hi rend="italics">from the sea.</hi> Unlike <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>, and most harbors, the navigation here is exceedingly difficult even when there is <unclear></unclear> opposition or obstruction; and it can be easily inferred, then, that, with a score or <num value="2">two</num> of guns bearing upon the narrow channel, and submarine batteries to aid the forts on shore, and enemy would find it &#x0022;a hard road to travel.&#x0022;--As for the attack by sea, all is ready, the guns are trained, the powder dry, the men in good spirits, &#x0022;and,&#x0022; remarked an old <unclear></unclear> &#x0022;we are just waiting to send a few of them to the D--.&#x0022; [Davy's locker, probably.] I am confident nothing can be done from the scar alone and that while the fleet engages the fort, it will be merely to cover up the operations of a force previously landed at <placeName key="tgn,2094725" n="1.000 16" reg="wrightsville, york, pennsylvania">Wrightsville</placeName> or <placeName reg="Masonboro' sound">Masonboro' sound</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>In <persName n="Whiting,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Whiting,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Whiting</surname></persName> I have every confidence, and so have the people here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>All he wants is men, and those ought to be sent <hi rend="italics">at once.</hi>--hurried on with the greatest possible speed, for without them the town certainly falls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Already I hear troops are on the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> grant they may arrive in time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> In my opinion, the loss of <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName> would be the greatest loss the <rs>Confederacy</rs> has sustained since the fall of New Orleans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>I do not care to give my reasons, although I could do so, I think, in a manner satisfactory to any <num value="1">one</num>, and could show cause why it should be defended above all other towns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Only those who have been here within the past year know its importance fully; but should the town fall into the hands of the enemy, the soldiers of our armies would feel its loss, and would then know why it should have been protected at any cost. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/> All day long the storm has raged furiously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Wind southwest, and blowing heavily. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/> This evening, a singular incident occurred to me, and <num value="1">one</num> peculiarly illustrative of the times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>There is a Latin law maxim which says: <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">Legis constructionon facit infuriam</hi></foreign> --the, interpretive construction of the law shall wrong no person; and also a maxim in <persName><foreName>Terrence</foreName></persName>, which I remember to have met in college days: <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">Jus summum sape summa est <unclear></unclear> </hi></foreign>--law enforced to strictness sometimes becomes the severest injustice. --Now, I do not wish to quarrel with a very wise law that forbids the publication of nows that might produce harm; but this much I do say: that what is lawful to publish in <num value="1">one</num> paper is also lawful to publish in another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>I think I can prove that logically should any <num value="1">one</num> be disposed to dispute the conclusion; and I maintain further, that what my neighbor is permitted to publish in his paper, I may be permitted to publish in mine, under the same law; and that a denial of that right to me is, according to <persName><foreName>Terrence</foreName></persName> &mdash; tolerable authority by the way &mdash; a law enforced to strictness and injustice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> This morning appeared in the <orgName n="Wilmington Journal" type="newspaper">Wilmington <hi rend="italics">Journal</hi></orgName>, what every man, woman and child knew perfectly well, and what the <rs>Owl</rs> and <persName n="Lamb,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Lamb,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Lamb</surname></persName> took abroad, the following item of news: </p> <cit><q rend="break">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> &#x0022;Amongst the fleet off <placeName reg="New Inlet, Northampton, Virginia" key="tgn,2539328">New inlet</placeName>, the <term type="ship">war ships</term> <rs type="ship">Colosado</rs> and <rs type="ship">Wabash</rs> have been recognized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>We are not sure the report of a portion of the fleet being off the western bar is correct; at least, no such report had been received at headquarters up to <time value="6oclock">6 o'clock</time> <time>yesterday</time> evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The fleet off <placeName reg="New Inlet, Northampton, Virginia" key="tgn,2539328">New inlet</placeName> consists of over <num value="30">thirty</num> vessels, of all classes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The wind yesterday evening was from northeast, and the weather was unfavorable for landing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>No demonstration had been made to land, at last accounts, from the coast.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="wilmington Journal"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> Knowing this would reach <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> to morrow and appear upon the <hi rend="italics">Dispatch</hi> bulletin board, I thought to expedite matters by sending the gist of this paragraph by telegraph; so wrote the following: </p> <cit><q rend="break">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>From this point, <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00059" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName>, in <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> more, falls back <measure n="19miles" type="distance">nineteen miles</measure> farther, and there, <measure n="41miles" type="distance">forty-one miles</measure> farther, he was still standing, while <persName n="Thomas,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00060" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,nomatch:0"><surname>Thomas</surname></persName>, who had routed him, and was pursuing and capturing prisoners at every step, was still <measure n="15miles" type="distance">fifteen miles</measure> in his rear, not having been able to pursue a routed, flying, disorganized enemy more than <measure n="26miles" type="distance">twenty-six miles</measure> in <measure n="5days" type="date">five days</measure>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>An official dispatch to the same effect was received at the <orgName n="War Office" type="office">War Office</orgName> on yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>Nothing is said &mdash; nothing, perhaps, is known &mdash; of the direction taken by them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>The general impression seems to be that they have gone to aid <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00161" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,Charles,R.,,"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> in an attack upon <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>Although, doubtless, <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00162" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,Charles,R.,,"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> will require all the aid he can obtain when he undertakes the attack upon <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, yet we think it quite as likely the <rs>Porter Butler Armada</rs> has gone in search of some quiet port, wherein to refit and repair damages; for the armada was most roughly handled on the <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> coast: <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, by the winds and waves; then, by the heroic little garrison of <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName>; and then again, by the still angry winds and waves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>We have yet to learn how much it was damaged by the elements, to the fury of which it is, perhaps, still exposed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>We know how it fared at the hands of the garrison of <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName>; but the repulse of this grandest of land and naval expeditions was so speedy and complete that, on its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> announcement, we could not altogether credit it. It seemed hardly possible that a force so enormous should be beaten oil and discomfited by a garrison of a few <num value="100">hundred</num> men, a good part of whom were raw militia, that we were inclined to doubt whether any serious attack had been made; whether the whole demonstration were not a reconnaissance or a feint, preliminary to the grand movement against the real objective point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>But, with all the facts before us, we are convinced not only that <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName> was the object against which the expedition was sent out, but are awakened to the tremendous character of the assaults which were sustained and repelled by the thin garrison of our forts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>The whole powerful fleet having shelled the devoted fort for <measure n="14hours" type="date">fourteen hours</measure>, knocking every house in it about the heads of the garrison, <num value="5">five</num> brigades, numbering from <num value="10000">ten</num> to <num value="12000">twelve thousand</num> men, assaulted it furiously and repeatedly on the land side at night.--The enemy's calculation was that, the fortitude of our troops being shaken by the awful bombardment, they would offer little resistance to the infantry attack; but in this they were signally undeceived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>Our men stood bravely to their guns, and so cut up their assailant in every renewed attack as to cause them to retreat precipitately to their ships.
