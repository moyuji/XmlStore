<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> Our roads on the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>, rendered bad by the frequent rains of <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>, are now almost impassable, except by troopers, I am happy, however, in being able to state that the health of our men has much improved of late, as the closing of <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs type="place">Williamsburg hospitals</rs> shows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>This will be gratifying intelligence to all who have friends in the <name>Peninsular</name> army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> The re-enlisting of volunteers goes Bravely on, and you may rent assured that before the present time expires a large number will have enrolled their names.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The battle at Somereset, and subsequent retreat of our army there, has, so far from disheartening our troops given an impetus to re-enlisting, and an assurance of future success. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> Among the many efforts being made of increasing our army, is <num value="1">one</num> down here which will render <hi rend="italics">more</hi> effective a valuable arm of our service &mdash; that of cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>It is in contemplation to raise a squadron, to be composed in part of the <q>&#x0022;<orgName n="Old Dominion Dragoons" type="dragoons">Old Dominion Dragoons</orgName>,&#x0022;</q> and styled <q>&#x0022;squadron Old I ominion Dragoons.&#x0022;</q> Of <persName n="Vaughan,Captain,William,R.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="default:Vaughan,William,R.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName n="William">Wm.</foreName> <foreName>R.</foreName> <surname>Vaughan</surname></persName>'s success in raising such a squadron, his untiring efforts leave no room for doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>For we have been thus early informed by the gailant <rs>Captain</rs> that the required number has been nearly, if not entirely secured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>It is also proposed to increase this body to a battalion, and the hope is foundly cherished that <persName n="Vaughan,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Vaughan,William,R.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Vaughan</surname></persName>, by pushing forward in this effort will succeed in raising a battalion of <q>&#x0022;mounted men.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> Such an organization, made up principally as it will be of residents of, and those who have been operating in this section, must prove most efficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>It is also intended to have at least <num value="1">one</num> of the companies armed with rifies, and thoroughly trained on foot in the <q>&#x0022;skirmish drill&#x0022;</q>--this to be amounted <orgName n="Rifle Company" type="company">rifle company</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>A battalion thus organized, the men thoroughly familiar with the woods and by-pathe, will, by acting beyond the outposts, keep back marauding parties of the enemy, who is even now burning and plundering the property of exited citizens of that section. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> By keeping the enemy in his entrenchments much will be accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>If he should come out in large numbers, then our brave men will have an opportunity of meeting force by force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>As a large number are already enlisted in this enterprise, we sincerely trust &mdash; indeed, believe &mdash; that <persName n="Vaughan,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Vaughan,William,R.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Vaughan</surname></persName>'s efforts will secure a battalion of mounted men. We may also say that <persName n="Vaughan,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="nearbymention:Vaughan,William,R.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Vaughan</surname></persName> was born and raised within <placeName><distance reg="3miles">three miles</distance> of <placeName reg="Bethel, Oxford, Maine" key="tgn,2044460">Bethel</placeName></placeName>, has practiced medicine in <placeName reg="Hampton, Hampton, Virginia" key="tgn,7013687">Hampton</placeName> and surrounding country for <measure n="12years" type="date">twelve years</measure>, and is thoroughly acquainted with the lower peninsula.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>It is greatly desired, for the good of our cause, that the <rs>Government</rs> will render such aid as will effect the object proposed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> Having seen in your paper of <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> last an article taken from the <orgName n="Philadelphia Inquirer" type="newspaper">Philadelphia <hi rend="italics">Inquirer</hi></orgName>, headed <q>&#x0022;Fight at the mouth of the <placeName reg="Rappahannock, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1129010">Rappahannock river</placeName>--Confederate schooner burned,&#x0022;</q> written by an officer on board of <num value="1">one</num> of the steamers blockading the <placeName reg="Rappahannock, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1129010">Rappahannock river</placeName>, and knowing that no such schooner has either been burned or captured, I deem it proper to make known through your paper to the public the facts of the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The circumstances connected with the fight are simply theses: During the week preceding the engagement the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had landed in <placeName key="tgn,2510683;tgn,7012288" n="0.205 000000.4091	placename;tgn,2510683;middlesex village, middlesex, massachusetts,Middlesex,Massachusetts,United States,North and Central America;0.028 000000.0568	placename;tgn,7012288;middlesex,england,united kingdom,europe,England,United Kingdom,Europe" reg="middlesex village, middlesex, massachusetts,Middlesex,Massachusetts,United States,North and Central America;middlesex,england,united kingdom,europe,England,United Kingdom,Europe">Middlesex</placeName>, and wantonly burned a private dwelling; and as it was supposed that similar depredations would be attempted, Captain Fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>of the <orgName n="Middlesex Artillery" type="artillery">Middlesex artillery</orgName>, with <num value="3">three</num> guns and a portion of his company, proceeded to a point opposite to which the blockading steamers were lying, and there planted his cannon. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> On the <date value="01-15">15th of January,</date> Captain Fleet, finding it necessary for some purpose, directed a yacht which was in the vicinity to be removed from <num value="1">one</num> point to another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, having caught a glimpse of the yacht, immediately started in pursuit with the larger steamer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>This rendered it necessary that the yacht.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>in order to escape and reach a place of safety, should run into <placeName key="tgn,2060620" n="1.000 11" reg="sturgeon, boone, missouri">Sturgeon</placeName>'s <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>, where the men who were in her went ashore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>When the steamer came up opposite to the mouth of the <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>, <num value="2">two</num> boats, with about <num value="20">20</num> men in each, were dispatched for the purpose of capturing the yacht, while she continued to shell the shore for a mile up and down, in order to protect her boats; which, having advanced within <measure n="300yards" type="distance">300 yards</measure> of the nearest cannon, <rs type="role">Capt.</rs> Fleet opened fire on them with canister; whereupon they immediately wheeled about and returned with the utmost precipitation to the steamer, which now resumed her fire with redoubled efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/><rs type="role">Capt.</rs> Fleet then gave the signal to <persName n="Hardy,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Hardy,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Hardy</surname></persName> to open fire on the steamer with the other <num value="2">two</num> guns, which were at some distance below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>This he did with great promptness and effect in the mean time, the small steamer having come to the aid of the large <num value="1">one</num>, they both kept up for some time a furious cannenade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>But, after a few well directed fires of our guns, they with drew, amid the repeated cheers of our men. Out of <num value="15">fifteen</num> shots, which were all that were fired at the steamers, the large <num value="1">one</num> was struck <num value="3">three</num> times, and the small <num value="1">one</num> twice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The <rs>Captain</rs>, as well as most of those who were present on the occassion, saw <num value="5">five</num> shots strike the steamers, though with what effect they could not positively determine, They were no doubt seriously injured, as, instead of lying at the mouth of the river as formerly, they now lie out in the bay, and have never ventured to come up the river since. </p>

The water approaches to that city from <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> are too narrow, tortuous, and easily obstructed, to admit the use of vessels, and if the enemy attempts a land attack, the chances in our favor of repelling him are <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> to <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>The reduction of <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> would be the work of months, and could only be effected by a large increase of <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00148" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>'s forces, an increase which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> exchequer is not able to afford for an operation stretching through a protracted period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>This occurred between <time value="12">12</time> and <time value="2oclock">2 o'clock</time> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, and the news was received here with every indication of regret and indignation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>We gather the following particulars from a young man from the <orgName n="Richmond Blues" type="military">Richmond Blues</orgName>, who participated in the fight, escaped in a small boat, and rowed to <placeName reg="Nags Head, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2075828">Nag's Head</placeName>, where he was taken up by <num value="1">one</num> of our gun-boats, and brought to this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>He is an intelligent lad, and I believe a son of your Postmaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>The enemy's ships, he says, opened fire on our batteries at <placeName reg="Roanoke Island, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014345">Roanoke Island</placeName>, about <time value="7oclock">7 o'clock</time> in the morning, and kept up an incessant fire until <time value="7oclock">7 o'clock</time> in the evening, doing, however, but little injury to the <rs type="place">Island</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>Gradually the sounds came nearer and nearer, and the shell came thick and fast over our entrenchments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>Confident of their own strength, our troops moved rapidly forward, when, in a few minutes, the ball opened and the terrific contest ensued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>Bravely did our boys stand up to the overwhelming forces of the enemy, and not till nearly every man was dead or wounded did they leave their stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>Nothing remained but retreat, which our men did, constantly turning and giving them a shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>Finding it useless to hold the island under such overwhelming numbers, the order to retreat from the <rs type="place">Island</rs> was given, and our remaining troops retired, leaving their stronghold in the hands of the enemy. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>The fact that some of our <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> companies were engaged in the fight, occasioned an intense and painful anxiety, particularly among those which could not be well concealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>It is but a short period since the <rs>Wise Legion</rs>, after an arduous and toilsome campaign in <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>, left here for the coast of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, and though now defeated in <num value="1">one</num> of the most desperate conflicts of the war, it is at least consoling to know that the men fought with determined bravery, against overwhelming adds, and won for themselves the proud appellation of heroes, of which their present situation cannot deprive them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>To the indomitable courage already exhibited on the battle-field, you have added the rarer virtues of high endurance, cheerful obedience, and self-sacrifice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>Accustomed to the comforts and luxuries of home, you have met and borne the privations of camp life, the exactions of military discipline, and the rigors of a winter campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>The rich results of your courage, patriotism, and unfaltering virtue, are before you. Intrusted with the defence of this important frontier, you have driven back the immense army which the enemy had sent to invade our country and to establish his dominion over our people by the wide-spread havoc of a war inaugurated without a shadow of constitutional right, and prosecuted in a spirit of ruthless vengeance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>By your valor and firmness you have kept him in check until the nations of the earth have been forced to see us in our true character &mdash; not dismembered and rebellious communities, but an empire of <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">confederate States</placeName>, with a Constitution safe in the affections of the people, institutions and laws in full and unobstructed operation a population enjoying all the comforts of life, and a citizen soldiery who laugh to scorn the threat of subjugation. </p>
