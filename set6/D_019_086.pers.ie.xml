<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/> In the midst of the exciting events now taking place at the anticipated points of collision between the <rs>Northern</rs> and Southern Governments, the systematic and persistent efforts which have recently been made to burn up the town of <placeName reg="Charlotte, Mecklenburg, North Carolina" key="tgn,7013584">Charlotte, North Carolina</placeName>, on account of its strong secession sympathies, have not attracted the attention they deserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>An intelligent correspondent of the <orgName n="Charleston Courier" type="newspaper">Charleston <hi rend="italics">Courier</hi></orgName> gives a detailed account of the plot, which is full of interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> fire was on the morning of <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>, the <date value="03-29">29th of March,</date> evidently the work of an incendiary, which was only prevented by the greatest exertions from involving the surrounding dwellings.-- The next was on the succeeding <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> about <time value="12oclock">12 o'clock</time>, which was followed by an attempt to fire the <rs n="Methodist" type="religion">Methodist</rs> parsonage, at <time value="4oclock">4 o'clock</time> the next morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>The church, adjoining the parsonage, took fire twice, but the citizens worried nobly, and succeeded in arresting the progress of the flames.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>Each of these places was in a thickly settled locality just where there was a number of old frame houses, so that their design was evidently to destroy the whole town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>On the next night, every square was guarded; but on <time value="7oclock">seven o'clock</time> the next morning, a stable was fired, in the must of the inflammable out-houses belonging to the principal hotel and in such a location that, as soon as it was discovered, everybody exclaimed, <q>&#x0022;Now the town must go !&#x0022;</q> With great labor, however, the fire was got under, and the town once more saved; but it did not prevent a similar attempt <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> after.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>The citizens have discovered the incendiaries to be a band of white desperadoes, who are supposed to be <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> emissaries, employed to destroy the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>The object, it is said, cannot be plunder, for quite a number of valuable articles have been picked up, which were scattered about in carrying the furniture out of different houses, and in every instance they have been returned to their owners by both <rs type="color">white</rs> and <rs type="color">black</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>There is not the slightest suspicion of the slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>The fire companies of <placeName reg="Charlotte, Mecklenburg, North Carolina" key="tgn,7013584">Charlotte</placeName> are composed principally of slaves, having regular uniform; and had it not been for their untiring labors and noble conduct, the whites would have been almost homeless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>All those colored people who are not members of companies are so terrified that they seem afraid to leave their owners, for fear something terrible will happen to them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/> It is thus that unoffending communities of the <rs>South</rs> are harassed and imperilled, simply for peaceably endeavoring to extricate themselves from the &#x0022;glorious Union&#x0022; with the <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00418" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName></hi> Government. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/><placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> is built upon an artificial island, at the entrance of our harbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>The foundation being of stone, it must be of the strongest nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>That portion of the fort above the water line is of brick and concrete of the most solid character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>Its plan is a truncated pentagon, with <num value="1">one</num> side parallel to the adjoining shore, thus presenting an angle to the channel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>Of the truncated angles the eastern, western and northern are simply formed into <hi rend="italics">Pan-compees,</hi> whilst the other <num value="2">two</num> are formed of <num value="2">two</num> small faces, making an angle of about <num value="15">fifteen</num> degrees with the sides of the pentagon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>At each intersection of the small faces is a sally-port.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>The height of the parapet above the water-line is <measure n="60feet" type="distance">sixty feet</measure>. --On the eastern and <rs n="western sides" type="product">western sides</rs> are the barracks for the privates, mess-hall, kitchen, &#x0026;c. On the southern side are the officers' quarters, which are finished in very handsome style. </p> </q><bibl n="Charleston Mercury"></bibl></cit>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/> It is mounted with the heaviest guns of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> service, arranged in <num value="3">three</num> tiers, the <num value="2">two</num> lower being Casemates and the upper Barbette guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>The Casemate guns are those which are fired from an embrasure in the <rs>Scarp Walls</rs>, and are protected from the enemy's <hi rend="italics">shells</hi> by an arched bomb-proof covering over-head; the <name>Barbette</name>, those which fire over the parapet, which exposes the cannoneers to the fire of the enemy, although, in this instance the height of the ramparts is so great that there is comparatively no danger from the shot of an enemy's fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>The armament consists of <num value="140">140</num> pieces, placed in the following order: The heaviest guns, such as the <num value="32">32</num> and <num value="64">64</num>-pounders, on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> tier; <num value="24">24</num> and <num value="32">32</num>-pounders on the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> tier; Columbiads (<num value="8">8</num> and <measure n="10inch" type="distance">10-inch</measure>) and heavy sea-coast mortars on the top of the ramparts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/> The heaviest pieces are turned toward the harbor, the lighter toward the land side; which side is further protected by musketry, for which loopholes are cut in the <rs>Scarp Wall</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>The number of each kind of gun <hi rend="italics">is about</hi> <num value="30">thirty</num> <num value="64">64</num>-pounders, the same number of <num value="32">32</num>- pounders, <num value="40">forty</num> <num value="24">24</num>-pounders, <num value="10">ten</num> of each calibre of Columbiads, <num value="10">ten</num> <measure n="13inch" type="distance">13-inch</measure> and <num value="10">ten</num> <measure n="10inch" type="distance">10-inch</measure> mortars, capable of throwing about <num value="4000">four thousand</num> (<num value="4000">4,000</num>) pounds of shot and <num value="4300">four thousand three hundred</num> (<num value="4300">4,300</num>) pounds of shell at each discharge. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/> On the terra-parade plain are situated <num value="2">two</num> furnaces for heating shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>The magazines are situated on the inner sides of the sally ports, and contain, at present, <measure n="40000l." type="pounds"><num value="40000">40,000</num> pounds</measure> of powder, and a proportionate quantity of shot and shell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>The landing to the fort is on the southern or land side, and is formed by a wharf projecting towards the shore, and also extending the length of that face. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/> This fort would be nearly impregnable if finished and properly manned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>Its weakest point on the south side, of which the masonry is not only weaker than that of the other sides, but is not protected by any flank fire, which would sweep the wharf.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/>Once landed, an entrance may, at the present state of the construction, be easily made, for the blinds of the lower embrasures, though <measure n="6inches" type="distance">six inches</measure> in thickness, may yet be easily blown away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>And even if this was impossible, scaling ladders can reach those of the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> tier, which are not protected in this manner. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/> This Concludes the brief sketch of a fort which is a most perfect specimen of civil and military engineering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>The whole work has been conducted in a manner that reflects the highest credit upon the engineers, and is worthy to occupy the prominent position that it holds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/> The <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> papers of Thursday contain some items of unusual interest, in view of the news published this morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>We extract the following: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/> Yesterday was another busy day with our military men. From daybreak until sunset, and far into the night, steamers were constantly plying to and fro between the city and the batteries, transporting men, provisions and munitions of war. As for the probability of a fight, and that right soon, most people have come to regard it as a fixed fact, and we may add that it is regarded as equally certain that our brave boys at the batteries will not unbe seem their ancestry, and that the hireling invaders sent by <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00542" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> will have cause to rue the day they set foot upon the soil of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/> About <time value="3oclock">three o'clock</time> our Reporter, in the suggestive company of cannons, balls, shells, and every description of munitions of war, besides a very large amount of provisions, embarked for a hasty trip to the harbor batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>Everything seemed, indeed, in apple pie order, both on <placeName reg="Morris Island, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2525074">Morris</placeName> and <placeName reg="Sullivan's Island, Sullivan's Island, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096782">Sullivan's Islands</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>The troops at all the posts seemed in good spirits, and much invigorated by the prospect for a brush.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>Among them was the grey-haired volunteer from <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, <persName n="Ruffin,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00543" reg="mostcommon:Ruffin,Edmund,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Ruffin</surname></persName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/> The most efficient provisions for lights, etc., were made last night, to detect the approach of <orgName n="U. S.
