The analysis is that two versions of double-keyboarding had been submitted, and the separate files had not been compared, so Q-A had not been performed.

These files were returned for high Q-A to DDD, but the following errors on NW_RichTimesD_023_036.xml were discovered SIMPLY through running dif with alternate versions of file: 1) date in masthead is keyboarded as 18 August, and elsewhere as 13 August (correct date is latter); 2) Stonewall Jackson instead of Stonewall Jackson; 3) enthusiastic instead of enthusiastic.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/> At the commencement of the rebellion we kept a list of the individual contributions, the free offerings of our people, to assist the <rs>Government</rs> in the prosecution of the war and the suppression of the unholy rebellion, until the amount reached upwards of <num value="45000000">forty-five millions</num> of dollars, all of which was given without any expectation of its return, save in the security to life and property that would be guaranteed by the success of the <rs>Union</rs> arms, as well as the vindication of our <rs n="Republican" type="political">republican</rs> form of government by the crushing out of the extensive conspiracy against it &mdash; a conspiracy not confined to our own country, but extending to the aristocracy of the Old World.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>Since that period no correct lists of these donations have been kept.--Not a day, however, passes without our chronicling the donation of patriotic individuals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>The rich and the poor of every locality are continually placing upon the altar of their country their private <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> means, and swelling the amount of the patriotic contributions in behalf of our Government, to a sum unparalleled in the history of the world. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/> Ever since the last call of the <rs>President</rs> for troops the public have liberally come forward with their funds to make the response quick and emphatic.--Individuals have given their hundreds and <num value="1000">thousands</num>, societies and corporations their tens and hundreds of <num value="1000">thousands</num>, and, in fact, liberal contributions have been made in every quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>The circumstances connected with most of these gifts, and the manner in which they have been made, speak volumes for the patriotism of our people and their devotion to the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>Take, for example, the <orgName n="Police Department" type="department">Police Department</orgName> of this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>They have already organized <num value="2">two</num> full regiments, and have <num value="2">two</num> more under way, and at the same time have secured a fund for the support of the families of those who enlist in their regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>To this fund they have already received individual contributions varying in amount from <measure n="25cents" type="currency">twenty-five cents</measure> to-<measure n="500dollars" type="currency">five hundred dollars</measure>, amounting in all to upwards of <measure n="30000dollars" type="currency">thirty thousand dollars</measure>. To this there will be added, on the <date value="09-01">1st of September,</date> from the police force, fully <measure n="25000dollars" type="currency">$25,000</measure> more, which will be daily augmented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>The families of those who enlist in the police regiment will be visited every alternate <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>, and their necessities supplied out of this patriotic fund, thus furnishing a guarantee to those who march to the battle field that their families will not suffer while they are absent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>Under this arrangement it is useless to add that the <num value="2">two</num> regiments of the <orgName n="Police Department" type="department">Police Department</orgName> were recruited in less time than any other in this city. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/> While this and the inducements offered by individuals for recruits for particular regiments are taking place in this city, the rural districts are not behind in their free-william tags. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/> We give these as examples of what has been done; but other localities are not behind in their free-will offerings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>If the entire amount of the individual donations could now be enumerated, together with those made by societies and corporations &mdash; for which there is no expectation of a reimbursement &mdash; the entire sum of free will offerings of our people, from the breaking out of the rebellion down to the present time, would amount to upwards of <hi rend="italics"><num value="100000000">one hundred millions</num> of dollars.</hi> The like is unparalleled in the history of the world, and tells a tale of the devotion of our people to our democratic form of government that the aristocracy of the Old World may well take warning from.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>It shows the earnestness of the masses and their determination to maintain our Government, that will be well for our officials carefully to consider and be ware how they trifle with. </p> </div4>
