<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> The <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName>, whose editors seem to regard themselves complete masters of strategic science, continues to solve the knotty problem of the war with as much self-satisfaction as it is possible to imagine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>In its issue of <date value="04-28">April 28th</date> that paper lays down the programme of the campaign as follows: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> A great <rs n="Battle of Corinth" type="battle">battle at Corinth</rs>, <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, and another at <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>, <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> are imminent, and the news of the deadly clash of arms may reach us at any moment from either of these places &mdash; from which of them <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> it is almost impossible to say. Though the news we published yesterday from <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName> would indicate that <persName n="Halleck,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Halleck,nomatch:0"><surname>Halleck</surname></persName> will probably have the start of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, no <num value="1">one</num> can tell what a day may bring forth in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/><num value="1">One</num> of those battle scenes lies in the northeast corner of the rebel Confederacy, and the other in the southwest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> will probable move to the attack at both points nearly at the same time, in order to prevent either of the rebel armies reinforcing each other. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> The intelligence of yesterday from <placeName reg="Cairo Junction, Alexander, Illinois" key="tgn,7018995">Cairo</placeName> stated that on <name>Thursday</name> a skirmish took place between the advance guards of the rebel and national troops between <placeName reg="Pittsburg Landing, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2586587">Pittsburg Landing</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>, and the rebels were driven back towards the latter point, whilst <persName n="Halleck,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Halleck,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Halleck</surname></persName> was pushing his whole army vigorously forward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The dispatch informed us that <persName n="Stevenson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Stevenson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stevenson</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Danville, Danville, Virginia" key="tgn,7014729">Danville</placeName>, Ill, who accompanied the advance towards <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>, says he heard the constant rattle of cars and the sounding of steam whistles towards <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>, and concluded that the rebels were retreating there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The rattle of the cars and the sounding of the steam whistle would rather indicate that reinforcements were arriving at <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName> from <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The same sounds were heard before and during the <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">battle at Manassas</rs>, and turned out to be the indications of troops arriving from <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> and <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>When the rebels want to steal away, they don't make so much noise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>We have no doubt, therefore, that Van-<persName n="Dorn,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Dorn,nomatch:0"><surname>Dorn</surname></persName>'s force has arrived, and that a bloody battle is approaching at <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>, if it has not already taken place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/><persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> may this time await the attack, taking advantage of his stronghold to aid him against superior numbers and the superior skill of <persName n="Halleck,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Halleck,nomatch:0"><surname>Halleck</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>It is said that battle was offered the rebel General at <placeName reg="Pea Ridge, Benton, Arkansas" key="tgn,2009193">Pea Ridge</placeName>, <placeName><distance reg="6miles">six miles</distance> from <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName></placeName>, but he declined, though our troops, after surprising <num value="1">one</num> of his camps there, and driving in his advance, waited the onset of his main body from <time value="11oclock">eleven o'clock</time> till <num value="3">three</num>, at which time there were no signs of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Terrible will be the slaughter when these <num value="2">two</num> armies, numbering over <num value="250000">250,000</num> men, meet in battle array. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> The indications in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> are that a great battle may take place at any moment at <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>But it is hard to tell whether the enemy will await the blow preparing for him by <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>, or whether his wily strategy will prompt him to parry it by a feint, and strike suddenly with his main force at <placeName key="tgn,2112810" n="1.000 32" reg="mcdowell, highland, virginia">McDowell</placeName> or <persName n="Banks,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Banks,nomatch:0"><surname>Banks</surname></persName>, meantime throwing such obstructions in the way of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s advance as will prevent his taking part in the battle. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> Upon the result of these <num value="2">two</num> battles hangs the rate of the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>If the rebels should win both, their drooping spirits would be revived and the war would be prolonged indefinitely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>If they should even win <num value="1">one</num> battle, it would enable them to hold out for some time longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>But if they lose both, then it is admitted by their own journals that there is nothing left for them but guerrilla warfare; and we need scarcely say that this amounts to nothing when it is not in aid of large bodies of regular troops in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>It can only annoy and harass at best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>It can achieve no important result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>It is admitted, too, that the seacoast and the forts will soon be all in our hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>There is nothing left, therefore, for the rebels but submission if they are whipped in the <num value="2">two</num> impending battles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>We learn that all the <rs>Southern</rs> railroads have been seized by the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>, and that they rely on a new railroad from New Orleans, through <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> for <measure n="700miles" type="distance">700 miles</measure>, to bring them supplies of beef and corn, and probably arms and ammunition, by way of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>.--But as the road is not yet constructed, and laborers are only now being advertised for, this device will be too late for their purpose &mdash; too late even for the retreat of the defeated leaders to <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>From the perfect arrangements made by our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, we have no doubt that they will defeat the enemy in both battles, and in a short time the rebellion will have received the <num value="2">two</num> fatal blows from which it can never recover. </p> </q><bibl n="The New York Herald,"></bibl></cit>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The news of a great battle near <placeName reg="Corinth, Alcorn, Mississippi" key="tgn,7017649">Corinth, Miss.</placeName>, may be expected hourly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Extensive preparations are being made on our side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The enemy is doubtless equally active.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Both sides fully comprehend the importance of the impending engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>If the rebels should be defeated, the fate of the <rs type="place">Mississippi Valley</rs>, and, in a great measure, of the rebellion, will be decided. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> is not insensible to this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>His army is not ignorant of it. <persName n="Halleck,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Halleck,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Halleck</surname></persName> and the brave defenders who make up the grand army under his command, entertain similar views.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The approaching battle, if won by our troops, will be the last great battle, in all probability, that will be fought in the cotton States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>It is not to be expected, therefore, that the fight will be anything short of a desperate struggle. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/> Affairs in <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName> have lately taken a turn which we have long-regarded as more than possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>The tide of victory has set in favor of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/> These visits of foreign dignitaries to the rebel capital, in the last hours of the rebellion, are significant.
