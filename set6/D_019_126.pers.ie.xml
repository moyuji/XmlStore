<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> Our journey to this place was very slow, owing to the prolonged stoppages at different stations to prevent a collision with other trains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>It was made very pleasant, however, by the cheers from the honest hearted country people and the bouquets from the ladies, who seemed to stretch in a continuous line from <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> to <placeName key="tgn,2111971" n="1.000 34" reg="gordonsville, orange, virginia">Gordonsville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>In <num value="1">one</num> place about haft-way on the road, every girl in the country seemed to have prepared a small package with something nice in it, tied up with a piece of paper containing an appropriate <unclear>mo or</unclear> exhortation, signed with her own names.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>As for bouquets, every man in the <name>Regiment</name> was smothered with them, and I doubt whether we will get over the hoarseness from constant cheering for a week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>When we reached the encampment, which we did <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> about <time value="11oclock">eleven o'clock</time>, we experienced some little inconvenience, and had to put forth some slight exertion to get things into comfortable order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Our sleeping accommodations, as you might imagine, were not of the most insurgent character, though old Dame Nature had provided us with couches of a creditable quality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Some apprehension was felt in regard to the supply of that greatest of all luxuries, water; but a short reconnoitering tour disclosed to us the most ample supply of the purest kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>We are all perfectly satisfied and as merry as larks. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> We are expecting every day to meet the troops from <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>, and at night every man is sleeping with his loaded market at his side. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> Yesterday the <name>Regiment</name> had a very good opportunity of showing their spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>While we were at work we noticed that something unusual seemed to be going on; the staff officers and cavalry were flying about converting orders, when suddenly a horseman come in a gallop through the <name>Regiment</name>, spoke a few words to the <rs>Colonel</rs>, and was off in a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Soon after, we heard the command given for preparing to march, and the men fell into line with a rapidity and precision not often displayed at dress parade or battalion drill &mdash; During the few minutes allowed for putting on equipments and getting ready, men rushed into the <name>Regimental</name> camp with the news that the enemy were right upon us, and were driving in the pickets; that they had <measure n="1" type="killed">killed one</measure> cavalry vidette and taken another, and that they would be during through as upon the main encampment in <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure>. To add to the slight excitement which this news created, we heard at the same time volley after volley of musketry in different directions around the camp &mdash; sometimes a detached report, then a dropping fire, and then a long, awful, concentrated roll.--Thinking that the pickets were already catching it, as they always do in an advance upon an encampment, the <name>Regiment</name> formed into line at a double quick, and, wheeling out of the camp with great rapidity, marched off on the road to <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>, expecting to meet the enemy's vanguard every moment, (which we did not meet, however). All along the road we met wagons, carriages, and other vehicles conveying families and chattels, coming down for safety, while every now and then some General, <rs type="role" n="Colonel">Colonel</rs>, or staff officer would pass us at a gallop, the only <num value="1">one</num> of whom any of us recognized was <persName n="Pression,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Pression,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Pression</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>We also passed <persName n="Marye,Mrs.,Moreton,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="default:Marye,Moreton,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <foreName>Moreton</foreName> <surname>Marye</surname></persName> in a carriage, just coming from <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> About <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> from camp I saw the most splendid sight of the kind that I ever dreamed of. Just on our right, <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a mile off from the road, a large body of Cavalry, from the upper counties, swept over the slope of a hill to a beautiful green field, taking everything in their stride, and moving with more regularity than I ever saw men move.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The great, powerful, glossy black horses, with ponderous troopers on their backs, their burnished arms and equipments glistening in the morning sun, formed a spectacle in the highest degree granted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> We marched on towards <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName> through the dust, and over brooks, <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creeks</rs>, and small rivers, until late in the day, and had halted to rest a little while, when <persName n="Bonham,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Bonham,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bonham</surname></persName>, the commander of the forces about here, surrounded by a large number of officers, rode up and <unclear></unclear> us a small speech, informing us that the detachment of the enemy (about <num value="500">500</num> strong) who had occasioned the alarm by some predatory excursion, had returned to <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>, having killed the unfortunate <unclear>viderte</unclear> mentioned above and taken the other, both of whom, with their eyes wide open, had gone, very rashly, close in on them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The General, in his speech, thanked us for our zeal and alacrity, said he knew where to find us when the enemy were before us, and then galloped off &mdash; leaving us nothing to do but to foot it back to camp, much enraged at not catching the scoundrels who had subjected us to the odious march and the sore disappointment, after undergoing it, at not having an opportunity of dealing out to them the just punishment which their treachery and depravity to richly merits. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> A <num value="1000">thousand</num> interesting things happened on our march back, which I am unable to write.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>We reached camp about dark, having had no dinner, and a very fatiguing march; and I would <unclear>frave</unclear> pitied the man who had offered any <num value="1">one</num> of the regiment supper for a dollar. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> We found when we got back that the firing in the morning was occasioned by some regiment firing off their guns previous to reloading.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>I cannot give my definite information as to the number of men encamped here, simply because I don't know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>I know <unclear>stirlless</unclear> what we are going to do, except to fall in at the alarm call, and march wherever they order us. J. H. B. </p> </div4> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/> <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> has long sought the dismemberment of the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>The Northern States of the <rs>Union</rs> were her greatest naval and manufacturing rivals in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>They were successful in their rivalry to her, by virtue of the free trade and close relations of intercourse and monopoly which they enjoyed, exclusive of all other nations, with the great agricultural States of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>So long as these intimate and exclusive relations subsisted, the enterprise and wealth of the manufacturing and maritime North of course grew apace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>Already had the commercial marine of the <rs>North</rs>, by the monopoly it enjoyed of the coasting trade of the <rs>Union</rs>, outgrown that of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> in magnitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>Already were the manufactures of the <rs>North</rs>, prosperous from monopolizing the profitable market of the <rs>South</rs>, competing with those of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> in every market on the globe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>The <rs>North</rs> enjoyed a great advantage over <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> in procuring raw cotton from the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/><placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> paid for the immense cotton supplies she required from the <rs>South</rs> in cash, or its equivalent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>The <rs>North</rs> paid for the cotton it purchased in its own mean manufactures, at double prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>The <rs>North</rs> also so manipulated the trade of the <rs>South</rs> that <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> did not even pay the coin with which she purchased Southern cotton into Southern hands; but she paid it to Northern merchants, enabling them not only to account for the money collected by shipping further mean goods at double prices to that section, but also to earn a brokerage for collecting the funds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>In every way did the close political Union between <name>North</name> and <name>South</name> place <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> at disadvantage, and magnify the resources and power of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>It has long been the darling object of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> to dissever this Union. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/> It was the interest of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> that the <rs>Union</rs> should be destroyed; and when, in all history, since the days of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Adams,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00098" reg="mostcommon:Adams,nomatch:0"><surname>Adams</surname></persName>,</hi> has any nation been known not to devote itself to a policy dictated by its interest?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>The question with <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> was, how was the dissolution to be brought about?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>There was but <num value="1">one</num> mode; and that was by employing the blind, bigoted, foolish, and besotted <persName><foreName>Puritanism</foreName></persName> of the <rs>North</rs> in the diabolical work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/><placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> well understood from bitter experience the nature of the agency she determined to invoke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>Her statesmen understood the infinite capacities for mischief of this dark, diabolical, insane genius of destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>She set to work early, insidiously and assiduously to accomplish her deep and masterly purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>She sent emissaries over to fire the self-righteous <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> heart with enmity to the slaveholder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>A single smouldering spark was sufficient to light in full time the whole bigoted mass. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/> How next was this fanaticism to be clothed with political power?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/><placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> knew that a majority of the whole <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> people could never be induced to embark in a policy injurious to the rights of a section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>She saw that the powers of a majority must be laid hold of through the agency of a minority vote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>If the entire powers of the <rs>Northern</rs> and larger section could be brought to bear on this antislavery policy, that would give a controlling majority in the several departments of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>If but a bare majority could be secured for this policy in each Northern State, that majority of a section, though a decided minority of the whole Union, would accomplish the whole design.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>Here was the weak point in our Constitution &mdash; that majority powers in the <rs>Government</rs> could be wielded by a minority of suffrages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>And the slavery question, through the agency of the <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> sentiment, presented the only topic of agitation, by which these majority powers could be concentrated in minority hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/><placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> laid hold of the only inflammatory question in <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> politics to employ it against the weakest point in our Constitution; for she well knew that the moment the <rs>North</rs> should, as a section, undertake to enforce its antislavery dogmas, the <rs>South</rs> would secede. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/> In all this deep game of diplomacy and craft, the astuteness of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> was only equalled by the stupidity of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>When we consider that nations are swayed by nothing but their interests, the <rs>South</rs> can cherish no very bitter feeling towards <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>She has simply pursued her highest policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>She has simply devoted herself, by means which diplomacy pronounces legitimate, to her own vital interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>But the <rs>South</rs> has just reason for indignation at the conduct of her associate section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>That section has allowed itself to be instigated to continual acts of meanness and injury; and this injury and meanness has been wanton and gratuitous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>It has assumed a position of hostility to us, and breathed out upon us for <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> no other sentiments but of bitterness and hatred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>It has not merely committed a great blunder &mdash; and the blunders of nations are crimes &mdash; but has brutally outraged all the relations of fellowship, neighborship and union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>Strong as our hereditary antipathies are to <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, there is not a true man in the <rs>South</rs> who does not feel in his heart more disposed to encourage commercial relations with <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, who has simply pursued a line of masterly policy, than with the <rs>North</rs>, who, reckless of the interests of both sections, deaf to all the counsels of friendship and fraternity, has, in a blind spirit of hatred and meanness, pursued a course of wanton insult and injury which has made all further union intolerable and impossible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/> The most melancholy exhibition of mental imbecility that modern times has seen, is the efforts of such Northern papers as the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> to put back the blame of the <name>Abolition</name> agitation upon the shoulders of <persName n="England,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00099" reg="mostcommon:England,nomatch:0"><surname>England</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>If a grown man, of good sense and sound mind, is gravely advised by another heir to the same estate, to commit suicide, that other, thinking he has too much sense to take his advice; and if the grown man actually does cut his own throat, the universal sentiment of the public will pronounce the fool to be the bigger rascal of the <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>The remorse of the evil adviser will be probably drowned in the undivided enjoyment of the estate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>The follies of besotted criminals are less tolerable than the successes of unscrupulous men. </p> </div3>

<head>&#x0022;Rebellious States.&#x0022;</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/> History is not unfamiliar with the idea of rebellious provinces and revolting colonies; but the term rebellious <hi rend="italics">States</hi> is novel and of recent coinage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>A State is a community endowed with the attributes of sovereignty, <num value="1">one</num> of which is the right to make and unmake treaties, to form and dissolve alliances, to enter into and withdraw from Confederations, to dispose of its own destiny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>A province is a boy under age, a State is a man over <num value="21">twenty-one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>That <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> is a State, that <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> is a State, that <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> is a State, there is no man fool-hardy enough to deny; and that a State is superior to a colony in the very attribute of sovereignty, which conveys the power to dispose of its own destiny, cannot be disputed by any man who admits the force of reason, logic, settled law or public opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>The very fact that the <rs>Southern States</rs> constituting the <rs>Confederacy</rs> are <hi rend="italics">States,</hi> settles the whole question of their power to dispose of their own destines, including that of withdrawing from, as well as entering into a Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>There has been a difference of opinion among statesmen, whether the right under which this power of withdrawal from the late Union is exercised is constitutional or extra-constitutional; whether the act by which the <name>States</name> entered into the <rs>Union</rs> is revocable in constitutional form; but all admit that the right of withdrawal exists in virtue of the sovereignty of the <name>States</name> whether the act be deemed constitutional or revolutionary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>The <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> shows its appreciation of the whole case of the <rs>South</rs>, when it characterizes our secession as the act of <q>&#x0022;constituted States retiring from a voluntary confederacy.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/> The epithet <q>&#x0022;rebellious States&#x0022;</q> is, therefore, a contradiction in terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>There may be rebellious citizens, rebellious provinces, rebellious colonies, rebellious districts, but such a thing as a rebellious State there cannot be.--When a <hi rend="italics">State</hi> takes action, it is its <hi rend="italics">sovereignty</hi> which moves, and that sovereignty knows no superior authority against which it can be in rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>Its action may be morally wrongful; it may be in violation of treaties; in revocation of compacts of confederation; in contravention of moral and international law; it may be provocative of justifiable war and righteous hostilities, in retaliation; but it cannot be rebellious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>There is no superior beneath the skies, against which a <hi rend="italics">State</hi> can be in revolt or rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>It may do a wicked thing, and may bring upon itself the penalties due to outrage and wrong; but it cannot commit rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>When, therefore, the <rs>Northern</rs> journals speak of the <rs>Southern</rs> as <q>&#x0022; rebellious States,&#x0022;</q> they at once disclose their ignorance of public law and their imbecile malice as enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>Of all the missiles that can be employed in war, epithets are the most impotent and the most harmless. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/> The longer the hostile section prosecutes this war, the more and more open their eyes will become to the folly of their theory, that it is but a rebellion they are dealing with.--Their own acts belie their theory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>Whoever heard of <num value="250000">two hundred and fifty thousand</num> soldiers being required to quiet a mob or suppress a revolt?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>Surely, when insurrection reaches such prodigious proportions, it would be better at once to call it war. Besides, it is not an uprising of a populace, but of a great family of States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>Who ever heard of a revolt of States--of <num value="11">eleven</num> <q>&#x0022;rebellious States, <num value="3">three</num> others vibrating in the balance?&#x0022;</q> It might as well be said that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> is in rebellion against <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName>; that <placeName key="tgn,1000095" n="1.000 392" reg="espana">Spain</placeName> is about to be annexed to <placeName reg="Republica Dominicana" key="tgn,7005388">San Domingo</placeName>; or any thing else as preposterous, as to say that <num value="11">eleven</num> Southern States can take care of their own destinies only in the character of rebels.
