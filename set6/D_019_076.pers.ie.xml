<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>He desired the withdrawal of the resolutions, and advocated the adoption of a series offered by himself, early in the session.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>He maintained that they covered the whole subject wherein the people of his section demanded a change in the organic law, and he utterly repudiated the idea that the question had been introduced here to distract the counsels of the <rs>Convention</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>It had been his belief that the matters pertaining to Federal Relations would have been settled before this time, and he read a series of propositions which he designed to offer, if an opportunity occurred, as a substitute for the report of the <rs>Committee</rs>, embracing a variety of amendments to the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>, as a condition of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>'s remaining in the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>He believed his constituents would sustain him in offering an ultimatum, which would finally settle all the distracting questions now agitating the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>While, however, he was willing to go as far as any man in demanding the rights of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> in respect to Federal matters, he never would consent to an adjournment of the <rs>Convention</rs>, unless it adjourned forever, until the subject of taxation had undergone a thorough and fair investigation. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> After a humorous allusion to the hopelessness of a cause which required members to occupy <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> in an exposition of their views, and the prevailing epidemic for speaking, (to which he attributed the delay of action,) he went on to show that the backwardness of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> in the scale of improvement and population, was owing to the working of the <rs>Federal</rs> system, and not to the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The <rs>North</rs> had grown up under a system of commerce and manufactures, protected and encouraged by the legislation of the <rs>General Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Its whole history shows that it has looked to Northern protection, and to that alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>After giving a narrative of the origin and growth of manufactures in the <rs>North</rs>, he said that the <rs>Government</rs>, while we were endeavoring to adjust the <rs>National</rs> difficulties, instead of giving us the olive branch, had given us the <name>Morrill</name> tariff, the worst tariff that had ever been imposed upon a people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>He contended that the <rs>North</rs> were not only protected in their manufactures, but in their agricultural productions, by furnishing a home market for everything the farmer could supply. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> He went on to show the effect of the vassalage of the <rs>South</rs> upon her own industry, by relating facts in his own experience as a sugar planter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>All the profits of Southern planters, or, at all events, a great proportion thereof, went into the pockets of Northern manufacturers; for they raised nothing except the leading staples, and depended upon the <rs>North</rs> for all their supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>He believed that if we had had free trade instead of a protective tariff, the profits of the planters would have been sufficient to make the <rs>South</rs> a wealthy community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>It would be impossible, he conceived, for the <rs>South</rs> to overtake the <rs>North</rs>, and thus the question arose, what must we do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>He thought that the <rs>South</rs>, in making her demands, ought to require a free trade, instead of which the <rs>North</rs> had given us a Morrill tariff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>He loved every section of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, and would say to the members from the <rs>West</rs>, that he was willing to concede all they asked, rather than that <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> should be divided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The great question at issue between them would have to be settled by compromise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>He would take a middle ground, and send an ultimatum to the <rs>North</rs>; if rejected, say to them <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> will go out of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>This was the compromise which he favored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>He thought if secessionists would come to this ground, conservatives might also come to it. He hoped all sides would come to such a conclusion at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The people would still have to act upon it, and he rejoiced that it was so. The proposed <orgName n="Border State Conference" type="conference">Border State Conference</orgName>, he thought, would do not good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The people sent us here to act for <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, and not for the <rs>Border States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>he would not consent to put the rights and honor of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> into other hands than <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Let the <rs>Convention</rs> adopt this ultimatum; let it be sent to the people, for them to say whether, if rejected by the <rs>North</rs>, the <rs>Convention</rs> shall be authorized to take the <rs>State</rs> out of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>A vote could be speedily taken, and then the <rs>Convention</rs> could act, and act as a unity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> He did not think the <rs>North</rs> would accept the ultimatum, and then the question came up where should <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> go?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>He repudiated the idea of a Middle Confederacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The place of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> would be with the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The amendments reported by the committee were good so far as they went.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>He was not prepared to say that he would accept them; for, like his friend from <persName><roleName n="Princess">Princess</roleName> <foreName>Anne</foreName></persName>, he did not think they went far enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>He was, however, in favor of compromise, and hoped that something would be adopted upon which the whole <rs>South</rs> would be willing to stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>He then went on to reply to the argument of the gentleman from <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName> in regard to protection and free trade. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> The advantages of a separation from the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> were next pointed out. Under the system of legislation that prevailed, it would be impossible for <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> to become what the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of Nature designed she should become.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>In the event of a resumption of her sovereign powers, and a union with the <rs>Cotton States</rs>, he believed <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> would become the <rs>Manchester</rs> of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>He looked with no pleasure to the disintegration of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>He had always loved the <rs>Union</rs>, but this was not the time when our affections should have full control of our action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>It concerned him to reflect upon the great names and great deeds of the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>It saddened his memory; but he would rather see <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> annihilated than to see her live degraded; to see her become </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> The fixed figure for the time of scorn, </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> To point his slow and moving finger at. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/> He thought he could see that in the <rs>Southern</rs> flag which would do what the present flag would not do &mdash; protect the rights and honor of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Moore,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Moore,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Moore</surname></persName>,</hi> of <placeName key="tgn,2002186" n="1.000 7" reg="rockbridge, virginia, united states">Rockbridge</placeName>, arose to correct the position of the gentleman from <placeName reg="Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada" key="tgn,7013046">Halifax</placeName>, as stated on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, in reference to <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> <num value="30">thirty</num> odd years ago. He (<rs type="role">Mr.</rs> M.) voted in the <name>Legislature</name>, at that time, for measures to keep the <rs>Federal</rs> troops from coercing that State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>The gentleman had also held him up as an exceedingly bellicose character-- </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Bruce,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Bruce,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bruce</surname></persName></hi> said he merely passed a friendly <unclear>jeet;</unclear> he certainly intended no offence. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>He had voted in the committee uniformly against coercion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>He was in favor of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>The conceded ability of the orator prevents any comments on the manner of disposing of his theme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>He said that his excuse for appearing on the political forum would exonerate him in the eyes of Southern auditors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>He stated and vindicated the views of those who held secession to be our only remedy for intolerable grievances.--He held that it was a conservative remedy for our wrongs, rendered expedient by the unfriendly tendencies of our Northern allies, their assumption of power, and a radical difference in sentiment, which rendered harmony and brotherly union impossible.--By secession, the now determined foes of our domestic institutions would be converted into conservative allies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>It was our right to cut our Northern brethren adrift from the conceit that they had any hand in the regulation of our domestic concerns.--It was the direst resort of revolution, to make our <num value="4000000">four millions</num> of negroes the equals of the white man. The means by which the <rs>North</rs> sought to accomplish it were not feasible.--The end which they would accomplish would ruin us &mdash; the means revolutionize us. The right of secession was inherent to sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>By secession we sustain our legal rights, and maintain the local authority, which is their guaranty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>Secession appertained to us, a community of sovereigns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>It was a legal remedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>When it was accomplished the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> will have, in a pre-eminent degree, all the elements of greatness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>The monopolies of the <rs>North</rs> were artificial &mdash; they did not raise all their people needed &mdash; their exclusive privileges were perishable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>The secession of the <rs>Southern States</rs> would produce only temporary inconvenience to our people &mdash; no fundamental change could occur without this result, we had all the elements of unbounded prosperity &mdash; a chance of getting their best men, besides more territory.--A contrast favorable to Southern advantages was presented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>A <q>&#x0022;Border Confederacy&#x0022;</q> was deprecated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>There was no conflict of interest between the <name>Border</name> and Cotton States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>The slave trade had been prohibited by the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>The Southern States could harmonize together.--The Creator had made the negro inferior to the white man &mdash; he had made a place and created him to fill it. At the <rs>South</rs>, white men were on an equality with each other; not so at the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>When an inferior race comes in contact with a superior race, there are only <num value="3">three</num> solutions of the problem of government: amalgamation, extermination, or subordination &mdash; all of which had found an illustration in this continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>In our country, <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> extermination has been the rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>With the negroes, subordination is the policy,--and admirably has it worked for all concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>This relation the <rs>North</rs> seeks to overthrow; but by all that is dear to us, we are resolved that it shall not be done, and that we will neither kill nor marry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>There was no earthly probability that the status would be destroyed.--Society at the <rs>North</rs> would terminate in anarchy or monarchy &mdash; it was tending to agrarianism now. The people of the <rs>North</rs> were becoming foreignized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>At the <rs>South</rs> it is different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>We have a fair proportion of <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs>, <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> and <persName n="French,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00294" reg="mostcommon:French,James,S.,,:1"><surname>French</surname></persName>, and they are among our best citizens, and fully understand this view of the question, and do not wish our naturalization laws changed any more than we do.--The prospect of obtaining our rights by guarantees or concessions, was small.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>Union men now looked upon it as hopeless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>Each recurring day strengthened fanaticism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>The sentiment against us was powerful &mdash; we could not hope to overcome it. There was not going to be any fighting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/> --The fire-engine is not only a great convenience, but its moral influence, also, is not to be despised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>When the old-fashioned hand-engines were in use an alarm of fire was the signal for excitement, noise, and confusion, and sometimes when popular opposing engines were brought together, the members engaged in angry altercation, and occasionally disgraceful fights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>This arose sometimes &mdash; in fact, most generally &mdash; because all the loafers in the city, like Micawber, who were waiting for something to turn up, at the instant of the alarm would immediately spring forth, like tigers after their prey, to <q>&#x0022;run with the <name>Linesmen</name>. &#x0022;</q> On such occasions, if an available position was taken away by <num value="1">one</num> engine from another, a disturbance would be sure to take place, and bloody noses and black eyes would sometimes result as a natural sequence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>They are better preachers of <q>&#x0022;the word&#x0022;</q> than <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of those that stand in the pulpit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>What the city loses by paying for a special <orgName n="Fire Department" type="department">Fire Department</orgName>, with a steam fire-engine, the result has proved they will make up in good order and morality, gained by their use.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>Without disparagement to the former system in operation here, we can say, with truth, that the city has need to congratulate itself on the successful working of its paid <orgName n="Fire Department" type="department">Fire Department</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/> Nothing could be more preposterous, nothing more stupid, than the dogma that slavery is a curse to a country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>On the contrary, the heaviest calamity that could befall any slave State on this continent, the greatest curse that an angry <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> could inflict upon the <rs>South</rs>, would be the destruction of its slave institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>The <rs>North</rs> ascribe its own rapid increase in population and wealth chiefly to the immigration of foreigners; and does so with reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>The foreigner comes over, in the general, destitute, obliged to work, and willing to labor with his own hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> lives upon his wits; but the foreign laborer is a real producer-- he works with his own hands, he digs the earth, and he produces food for his own consumption as well as for that of his <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> taskmaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>Well may the <rs>North</rs> ascribe its prosperity in a great degree to the immigrant; for that individual becomes a <hi rend="italics">producer</hi> from the outset, and not until he accumulates a little capital by his manual industry, does he imitate the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>, resort to his wits for a livelihood, and resolve himself into a <hi rend="italics">consumer.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/> It is from immigration that the <rs>North</rs> derives its chief want, its most exigent desideratum &mdash; labor, manual labor; dirt digging, soil tilling labor; the labor decreed against man by the curse of <persName n="Eden,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00325" reg="mostcommon:Eden,nomatch:0"><surname>Eden</surname></persName>; the labor that brings to his brow the dust and the sweat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>Various are the devices which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> contrives to avoid, himself, this sweat of the brow-- machines without number, factories where women and girls are made to work in droves; ligneous nutmegs and hams; protective tariffs, and like inventions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>But the influx of penniless immigrants from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, was the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee's</rs> godsend-- poor, necessitous, stout, sinewy immigrants, used to privation and toil, willing to labor with their hands, anxious to barter their service for mere bread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>But the evil of immigrant labor is, that it is not permanent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>Industry in our flourishing country soon brings its reward of accumulated means and easy competency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>The humble, industrious immigrant soon grows too well-to-do to be willing or obliged to sweat and toil longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>His service at the shovel and the hoe is but an apprenticeship of a few years, at the end of which he becomes, in his turn, an employer and consumer, rather than a <sic>laborng</sic> producer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/> It is this windfall of labor by the <num value="1000000">millions</num>, pouring into the <rs>North</rs> during the last <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure>, that has been the leading agent in the rapid development and great prosperity of that section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>It remained at the <rs>North</rs> because it was wanted there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>It did not come South, because we had it already.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>The defect of this species of labor is its want of permanency-- is the fact that it is not (as to the individual) a life-time service, but a mere apprenticeship of a few years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/><placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> contains half a <num value="1000000">million</num> of life-time laborers, descendants of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Ham,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00326" reg="mostcommon:Ham,nomatch:0"><surname>Ham</surname></persName>.</hi> doubly decreed to service by the divine edicts pronounced against <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Adam,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00327" reg="mostcommon:Adam,nomatch:0"><surname>Adam</surname></persName></hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName reg="Canaan, Grafton, New Hampshire" key="tgn,2063278">Canaan</placeName></hi> -- to service for life, service in perpetuity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>Suppose that, by some fell decree every laboring immigrant in the <rs>North</rs> were suddenly swept from that stiff-necked land, who will estimate the <num value="1000">thousand</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num> of loss that would be instantly inflicted upon all its busy interests?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>Labor, labor, is the jewel of great price in a nation's casket.-- Labor is the bread and breath of a State. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/> It is proposed to bind <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> to a political association that will stampede her labor like a pestilence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>It is proposed to chain her to a destiny that at once exiles from her borders the grandest body of productive labor to be found in any State upon the globe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>It is proposed, by allying the <rs type="role" reg="IsChild">mother of</rs> States to the immigrants of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, not merely to make her an alien and an enemy to her daughters of the <rs>South</rs>, but to bereave her of her institution of <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> labor, a handmaid that was born and was fostered with her, that has attended her from youth to age, and to whose faithful and efficient service she owes all her comeliness and comfort. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/> To show the productive value of this slave system to <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, we have only to contrast the property values of those counties within her borders which have few slaves, with those which have many slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>There could not be a better exponent of the wealth of each than the taxes levied upon them by the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>; for, except the inconsiderable stipend which is levied <hi rend="italics">per capita,</hi> these taxes are all levied directly in proportion to the values existing in the counties, which values are the product exclusively of the labor operating in those counties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>For the purpose of exhibiting this contrast we have coupled together in <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="10">ten</num> pairs, a county from the non-slaveholding portion of the <rs>State</rs> and a county from the slaveholding, bringing together such as contain nearly equal numbers of white inhabitants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>It will be found that in every <num value="1">one</num> of the cases adduced below, (and we will extend the remark without fear of contradiction that in every case which can be adduced at all.) the amount of taxes paid by the slaveholding county is more than double, often treble, that paid by the county having few or no slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>In each couple given, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> is a Western, the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> an Eastern county: </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/> Our city is full of strangers (the <rs>Convention</rs> being again in session,) and a world of merchants. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/> In the <rs>Convention</rs> to-day a pretty sharp debate sprung up, growing out of the secret ses -sion resolution, in which debate some severe strictures were made upon the new Constitu- tion, upon that clause admitting other States into the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>The fear seems to be that the non-slaveholding States will seek to annex themselves to the new Confederation, to which <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> is decidedly opposed &mdash; and, in my judgment, rightfully.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>A non- slaveholding State ought never to be admitted, and if possible to prevent it, several slave States might be dispensed with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>My fear is now that our Constitution will be adopted by the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> Government of <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>, and that that people will become so docile that they will be allowed to come into <hi rend="italics">society</hi> again, to which every decent man ought to enter his protest. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/> The <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> Government has certainly been considerate of us, in the adop- tion of their new tariff bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>If they had searched the world over, they could not have pitched upon any measure more to their own injury and our prosperity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>Already capital is flowing here and all parts of the <name>Confederation</name>, establishing houses, and by next fall you will see here some of the largest <rs n="dry goods" type="product">dry goods</rs> and other importing houses in the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>A joint stock company, of immense capital, is now being organized here, to open a leather and shoe business, and I hear of <num value="1">one</num> of the richest New York houses establishing a house in <placeName reg="Macon, Bibb, Georgia" key="tgn,7013980">Macon, Ga.</placeName>, and by fall we shall be able to sell all the goods wanted by the people of the <rs>South</rs>, at full <num value="0.15">15 per cent.</num>--perhaps <num value="20">twenty</num>-- below Northern prices. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>They wish to send a war steamer to take off <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00453" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>, but <persName n="Pickens,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00454" reg="mostcommon:Pickens,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Pickens</surname></persName> and <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00455" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> refuse to let <num value="1">one</num> of their steamers come into our harbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>If they wish the <rs>Major</rs> to be con- veyed away in a war steamer, she may lie outside, and the <rs>Governor</rs> will direct a private steamer to convey the garrison to her; or the <rs>Major</rs> and his men may, if they prefer, have a steamer belonging to our port call and take him to New York; or they may have a safe passage through the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>The object of the party is evidently to throw the responsibility of the evacuation upon <persName n="Ander,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00456" reg="mostcommon:Ander,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Ander</surname></persName>- son; hence, they wish him to <hi rend="italics">request</hi> that his Government may order him away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>He will never leave until he is ordered, if he starves, nor will we let him leave without it is done by <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00457" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and his Cabinet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>The fact is, they are now put to their wits' end, and &#x0022;a little more grape&#x0022; and they will succumb entirely, for they are in inextricable difficulties already, and every lunge they make sinks them but the deeper. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/> I have also received letters from some of the best merchants in your State, making certain inquiries as to business, some having determined, in the <rs>Fall</rs>, to come here to buy goods. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/> Letters are constantly being received here from your State, asking what is the duty on various articles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>I give you the duty on several most used from your State, for the infor- mation of all interested.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/> Revenue stations and officers are placed on every road leading into the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, to examine trunks of all travelers and all packages to prevent smuggling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>Travelers would do well, and prevent delay and annoyance, by carrying as little baggage as possible, and let it be convenient for examination, and be sure to take nothing along in their trunks dutia- ble, and if they do, let it be where it can be at once seen, and have an invoice of the same and gold enough to pay the duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>And above all, let them keep their tempers.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/> It is said positively that a dispatch has been received to-day in the city for the long-delayed evacuation; but I shall believe it when I see the <rs>Confederate</rs> flag flying over the battle- ments of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/> Our citizens are growing restless and impatient at the continued inaction of the <name>Con</name>- vention, and the secession furor is rapidly increasing in intensity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>A great revolution has taken place in public sentiment, and had the election been deferred until now, it would doubtless have resulted in the endorsement of a more active policy than that sustained by our representative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>He, however, was sustained as a secessionist, in the event of a failure in the <orgName n="Peace Congress" type="congress">Peace Congress</orgName>; and should he now decline to support an Ordinance of Seces- sion, he will doubtless both disappoint and misrepresent his constituents. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>Should the Old Dominion long persist in remaining in her present de- graded position, or an <hi rend="italics">ad valorem</hi> system of taxation be decided upon, a large proportion of our slaveholding population will undoubtedly be driven South ward. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/> Our patriotic little county is steadily preparing for the worst, come when or in whatsoever phase it may. The arms, for which an appropriation was some time since made, have been procured, and are, I suppose, ready for distribution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>We have now <num value="3">three</num> well-organized and efficient volunteer corps, admirably officered, and well drilled and equipped, con- stituting an arm of defence of which any county might well be proud. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/><num value="3">Three</num> States have already ratified it, and this will do likewise in the course of this week, or the next at farthest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>No doubt the submission papers will send up to Heaven (it will never reach there!) a cry against the assumption of the several State Conventions for acting upon the question without reference to a vote of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>I beg these learned sources to inform the public whether the <name>Con</name>- stitution of the late Union was submitted to a vote of the people in a single State?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>If they do not know, I certainly can inform them that Conventions of the separate States, and not the people direct, adopted that Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>Be assured that if the sentiment of the people of the other States interested is but the half as well represented as is that of this State, it would be no act of love on their part to now ask them to do what they have delegated to faithful exponents the power to do for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>In the <rs>Convention</rs> of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> there were but <num value="7">seven</num> dissenting votes to the ratification of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and several of these were given upon grounds not at all pertinent to the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>My reason for speaking of this matter is to show how utterly absurd it is for those living in the <rs>Border States</rs> to longer en- tertain the idea of reconstruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>These people say, and say rightly, that the time of dif- ference between them and the <rs>North</rs> is not the imaginary line of <persName n="Mason,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00477" reg="mostcommon:Mason,nomatch:0"><surname>Mason</surname></persName> and <persName n="Dixon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00478" reg="mostcommon:Dixon,nomatch:0"><surname>Dixon</surname></persName>, but is <num value="1">one</num> drawn by the <name>Deity</name>, through the very hearts of the people themselves, of the <num value="2">two</num> sections, making them different in almost everything, language included.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>It is then the question, (reconstruction impossible)--&#x0022;Which side will <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> take?&#x0022; She may prescribe Federal nostrums, through the <rs>Union</rs> <rs type="role" reg="Doctor">Doctors</rs> of the <rs>Convention</rs>, until doomsday, but the disease of disunion has assumed a chronic turn which will defy any remedy that can now be administered for it. There can be union, it is true, but it must and will be a union of the <rs>South</rs>, let the political quacks at <placeName reg="Mechanics' Hall">Mechanics' Hall</placeName> do what they may, to the contrary not withstanding.--There is vitality still left in the Old Dominion, and it will not be long, in my opinion, before it is seen in the upheaving of the masses, who, slow to move, will prove they would rather be the equals of Southern brothers than the slaves of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>There is hardly a circumstance of importance con- cerning <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> politics not familiarly known in the <rs>South</rs>, so much interested are the peo- ple in what is going on in that State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>Indeed, the old mother seems still greatly loved and venerated by these, her expatriated children, who believe that the cycle of her glory is not yet complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>They contend, however, that she will not and cannot be unmindful of the high destiny which awaits her as the head of the family of <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>In my heart of hearts I pray that she may not disappoint not only these people, but those noble and liberty-loving children of the old mother, who, like the gallant <rs>King</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, of old, prefer death to such dishonor as political interiority imposes upon them. </p> <closer> <signed><placeName reg="Arlington, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,7015769">Arlington</placeName>.</signed> </closer> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>The excitement about the transfer to <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName> of the guns from <orgName n="Bellona Arsenal" type="arsenal">Bellona Arsenal</orgName>, was wholly uncalled for. It scarcely rose to the dignity of a tempest in a teapot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/>What were the facts?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/>In <dateStruct value="1857--"><year reg="1857">1857</year></dateStruct>, the <rs>Government</rs>, through <persName n="Floyd,Secretary,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00535" reg="mostcommon:Floyd,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Secretary">Secretary</roleName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName>, contracted with <persName n="Archer,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00536" reg="nearbymention:Archer,Junius,L.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Archer</surname></persName> for sundry cannon, to be delivered in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>The very date of the contract exonerated the existing Government from all hostile purpose in reference to the guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="829"/>The guns having been made, the contractor wanted his money, and applied for payment, and to his application it was replied, that on the compliance with his contract by the delivery of the guns in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, the money would be paid, and the head of the <orgName n="Ordnance Department" type="department">Ordnance Department</orgName> accordingly advised <persName n="Archer,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00537" reg="nearbymention:Archer,Junius,L.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Archer</surname></persName> to deliver the guns to <orgName><persName n="Colquitt,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00538" reg="nearbymention:Colquitt,W.,D.,,"><surname>Colquitt</surname></persName> &#x0026; Co.</orgName>, in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, to be by them re-shipped to <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName>, the chief <placeName reg="Virginia depot">Virginia depot</placeName> for the reception and keeping of National arms and munitions of war. So the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> movement of the guns had its origin in an act of indebtedness of the <rs>Government</rs> to a citizen of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, in need of, and demanding his money, In such a movement, no hostile intention could be detected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="830"/>It was but the doing of an ordinary act in the ordinary routine of the business of a department of the <orgName n="War Office" type="office">war office</orgName>, and it was done without any regular military order of the head of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, which at once negatives the idea of any inconsistency between the statement of the officer of the <orgName n="Ordnance Department" type="department">Ordnance Department</orgName>, and that of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="831"/>Thus far, the facts gave no ground for the supposition that the <rs>Government</rs> designed to employ the guns against <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, or for any dangerous or improper use. And it is conclusive against any unfriendly or warlike intent on the part of the <rs>Government</rs>, that the <orgName n="Ordnance Department" type="department">Ordnance Department</orgName>, immediately on being apprised that the removal of the guns had provoked excitement, notified <persName n="Archer,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00539" reg="nearbymention:Archer,Junius,L.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Archer</surname></persName> not to move them at all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="833"/>The simple truth was, that the guns were to be sent to <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName> because it was the only convenient depot in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> to which they could be sent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="834"/>It was not only the most natural and proper place to send them to, but the only <num value="1">one</num> in the <rs>State</rs> within convenient reach.-- The panic which had arisen from these simple circumstances were unworthy the chivalry of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="835"/>It could have no other effect than to scare timid women and children, and did not become grown-up and bearded men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="836"/>And was not all this fuss about these guns <num value="1">one</num>, in a series of measures, designed to precipitate <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> into secession?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="837"/>Secondly, the <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName> has no right to pass these resolutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>Not at all. The wrong is in the seizure and appropriation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/>If she were at war with the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, or if by revolution she had dissolved all connection with that Government, the principles of self-defence and of well-settled international law, would justify the act.--But we are not at war with the <rs>Federal Government</rs>; our connection with it is yet undissolved; <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> is still in the <rs>Union</rs>, and being yet a member of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, she was bound by all the duties and responsibilities of that membership.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>Observing those duties and responsibilities, she could not seize and appropriate to herself property that was held for National purposes, for the common defence, that, in other words, belonged to the <rs>Union</rs> or the common Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/>Thirdly, (he argued,) the seizure of the guns by the <rs>State</rs> would be an act of war against the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>The taking of the property of <num value="1">one</num> nation by another nation, has always been regarded just cause of war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/>Will it not, then, be an act of war on the part of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, if she should seize and appropriate to herself the property of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>?

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="915"/> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Kemper,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00551" reg="mostcommon:Kemper,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Kemper</surname></persName></hi> said he sympathized in the indignation manifested by the gentleman from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond city</placeName>, (<hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Robertson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00552" reg="mostcommon:Robertson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Robertson</surname></persName>,</hi>) but thought that gentleman had <q>&#x0022;roared as gently as a sucking dove.&#x0022;</q> He (<hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Robertson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00553" reg="mostcommon:Robertson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Robertson</surname></persName></hi>) advocates a simple protest against the removal of the arms, and questions our power to seize them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="916"/>Your meek protest is crouching supplication at the foot of the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> throne; for when you protest with an acknowledgment on your lips that you have no right to enforce your protest, you avow that you will tamely submit if your protest is contemptuously spurned back upon you. Better do nothing than resort to the <hi rend="italics">brutum fulmen</hi> of such a thing as that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="917"/>Have we no power to execute our purposes by any means better than words?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="918"/>What did gentlemen mean on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day of this session when they voted that <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> would meet any effort at coercion by arms, and would resist it to the blood and to the death?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="919"/>Did any gentleman then say we violated the <rs>Constitution</rs> or our official oaths by pledging and binding <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> to make war upon the <rs>Federal Government</rs> in specific contingencies?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="920"/>Why, sir, gentlemen here have acknowledged that the removal and appropriation of these arms in the present condition of things, by the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, is coercion; and not to resist this incipient coercion by all the instrumentalities necessary to its suppression, is an ignominious backing down from the position of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="921"/>The gentleman, (<hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Robertson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00554" reg="mostcommon:Robertson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Robertson</surname></persName>,</hi>) too. while questioning the power of the <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName> to resist the removal, yet assures us that the <rs>Governor</rs> will resist it and prevent it, thus assuming that the <rs>Governor</rs>, who is the agent sworn to execute the will of the <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName>, has more power than the <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName>--that a fragment of the <rs>Government</rs> is more powerful than the whole Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="922"/>But I will not, at this late day, stop to demonstrate that <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> may interpose to arrest aggression by force, if necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="923"/>Any question or denial of that power now, any employment of your empty protests, or expostulations, or supplications in a crisis like this, is but a continuation of that policy of vacillation, of timidity and inaction, which has brought upon us all the iliad of our woes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="924"/>Sir, I feel it, and know it, that if this old Commonwealth had in the beginning of this crisis met Black Republicanism &mdash; uplifting in its face that sacred falchion which she bathed in the best blood of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> <measure n="80years" type="date">eighty years</measure> ago, every son of hers would have rushed to her defence, filled with the very spirit of the <name>Revolution</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="925"/>Every man would have been a hero, ready and exulting to die in her cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="926"/>The whole Commonwealth would have breathed deliberate valor, from the <rs>Ohio</rs> to the ocean, and the very spirit of aggression would have crouched in dismay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="927"/><placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> would have exercised her immemorial prerogative of leader of whatever cause she espoused, she would have been the marshal of the van-guard of the <rs>Southern</rs> column, and would have led the whole South--which was eager to follow her in solid array.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/>There would have been no fragmentary dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs>; there would have been no talk of coercion and no menace of civil war. Such a lead and such a Union of the <rs>South</rs> would have driven Black Republicanism to surrender the <rs>Government</rs> which it had confiscated under the forms of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and would have insured a peaceful and perpetual settlement of all our troubles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="929"/>But the vacillation of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> has brought about the disunion of the <rs>South</rs> itself, and it has united and emboldened her enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="930"/>It has robbed the old Commonwealth of all her power in the councils of the <rs>South</rs>, presented her to the world as, <q>&#x0022;a luke-warm friend and a placable enemy.&#x0022;</q> brought upon her the maledictions of her own allies, and contributed to bring the country to the utmost verge of civil war. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="931"/> <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> K., continuing, said he was sick and tired of this namby-pamby policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/>If we meant to do nothing, we should say nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933"/>If we really meant to prevent the removal of the arms, it was logically necessary to provide the means to execute the purpose of prevention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/>If we showed, by our preparation of means, that we were earnest in the matter, then our action would prevent riot and collision, and restore calm to the public mind of this vicinity upon this matter, at least.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/>Any superficial tampering with the matter would create the very ground-swell of popular riot and revolution, which gentlemen deplored.-- He commented with severity upon the letters of the <rs>U. S. Colonel</rs> of Ordnance and <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, denounced their duplicity, and declared that the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> was convicted of falsehood in denying that there had been no order for the removal of the arms.-- Gentlemen had spoken of another probable order, suspending or countermanding the removal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936"/>Even if such an order should have actually arrived, what of it?-- What faith was to be attached to the orders of the <name>Administration</name> after their known prevarication and duplicity?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="937"/>Were we not warranted in believing their object to be to temporize and delay for the present, and then to renew the order after the <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName> had gone home?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="938"/>No matter what order might be issued now, it did not warrant us in entrusting this delicate business, in the future, either to the mercy or the honor of a <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> authority, already convicted of perfidy and falsehood in respect to this very matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="939"/>He argued that anything short of the <name>Senate</name> resolutions would be no guaranty against a public outbreak in the future, and would not secure the rights of <persName n="Archer,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00555" reg="nearbymention:Archer,Junius,L.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Archer</surname></persName>, which we had already taken charge of and were bound to respect, for we had deprived him of the fruits of his contract with the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.--He deprecated any supplicatory effort to mollify the <name>Administration</name> in its action, or to temporize or treat with that power, but insisted that <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> should execute her own will, and by her own action secure her peace and safety. </p>
