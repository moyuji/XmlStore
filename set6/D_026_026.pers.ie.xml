<head>An important Measure.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> On <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> last a bill was passed by the <orgName n="House of Delegates" type="government">House of Delegates of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName></orgName>, appropriating the sum of <measure n="1000000dollars" type="currency">$1,000,000</measure> for the relief of the families of soldiers within the lines of the lines of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>We have not had an opportunity of examining the bill, but understand that it contemplates the distribution of this fund to the counties overrun by the enemy, through agents to be appointed to represent the county in the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>A proposition was made to prevent the exchange of Confederate money appropriated under this bill for other currency at less than specie value, which was properly, in our judgment, opposed by <persName n="Monroe,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Monroe,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Monroe</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Hampshire" key="tgn,7008139">Hampshire</placeName>, upon the ground that it would render the appropriation entirely useless in the very portions of country where it was designed to be operative and effective. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> The passage of this bill will doubtless exert a sanitary influence upon those gallant men who have left their homes and families within the enemy's lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Even if the objects of the bill are not attained to the extent contemplated, its passage will go to show that the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName> is not unmindful of the welfare of those who have sacrificed all for the accomplishment of Southern independence. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>As for any light which military experience sheds upon the subject, we are entirely in the dark, as we are not aware that any nation has ever before attempted such an experiment. --Even <placeName key="tgn,7016786" n="1.000 94" reg="prussia">Prussia</placeName>, when sorely beleaguered by her foes, did not call into the field men over the age of <num value="45">forty-five</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>The impolite of such an enterprise is heightened by the necessity of this class of the population to the production of supplies, too limited even now for the demands of the army, and by its encouraging effect to the enemy, who naturally hall it as an evidence of desperation, and of the exhaustion of our supply of able-bodied fighting men. The fact, however, is, according to the statement of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, that half the army are absent from their posts, and all that is necessary to meet the enemy on almost equal terms is to bring the absentees back to their duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>We are dealing with a foe who can only be mollified by the most vigorous measures, and who is governed by fear rather than kindness.
