<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> C. represents the blockade as only effective enough to be provoking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>During <num value="1">one</num> week that he spent in <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> <num value="4">four</num> vessels ran the blockade and entered that harbor, heavily laden with <name type="weapon">Enfield rifles</name>, army stores, and the more important necessaries.

Many articles are of course very scarce, such as the heavier classes of foreign imports, but he saw nothing of actual want more than is usual in large cities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The vessels which ran the blockade are mostly small, light-draught steamers, built solely with a view to speed, which clear from ports of the <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550">West Indies</placeName>, with <name>British</name> papers, for some neutral port, sail under <name>British</name> colors, and, with the aid of the best pilots.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The shell road and every avenue of approach to the city are defended by very powerful batteries, sweeping them for miles, while on either side felled trees form an impenetrable abattis out into the swamp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>And, to man the fortifications and aid in the defence, they have a force of no less than <num value="50000">50,000</num> men, under <persName n="Lovell,Major-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Lovell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major-General">Major General</roleName> <surname>Lovell</surname></persName>. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>A single regiment, in his opinion, could have taken <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, or the fleet could have run past <placeName key="tgn,2024563" n="1.000 48" reg="tybee island, tybee island, chatham, georgia">Fort Pulaski</placeName> and taken the city with more case than they reduced <persName n="Hilton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Hilton,nomatch:0"><surname>Hilton</surname></persName> <unclear>ad</unclear>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>But now everything has been lost, the fortifications have been strengthened, and the most efficient preparations have been made for a desperate defence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> At New Orleans the people were much depressed over the loss of <placeName reg="Port Royal Island, Beaufort, South Carolina" key="tgn,2593932">Port Royal island</placeName>,-- Subsequently, however, they consoled themselves with the reflection that it was foolish for them to have ever thought of holding the islands against our powerful navy; but when we attempted to leave the cover of our men-of-war and attack them on the main land, they would be ready for us. </p> </div4>

<head>Their spirit &mdash; about our fighting.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> They have made up their mind that the <rs>North</rs> must be as well convinced by this time as they are of the impossibility of reconstructing the <rs>Union</rs>, and must, therefore, be waging the war as <num value="1">one</num> of subjugation, Against this, former Union men will fight as readily as original secessionists, and it is this conviction which has, of late, produced such unanimity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>They regard <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> as a great General, but say it is a pity he should be compelled to deal with troops he is afraid to trust.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The fighting at <placeName reg="Belmont, Bullitt, Kentucky" key="tgn,2037699">Belmont</placeName>, they say, was about the only good fighting done in the war, on our side, and they are amazed that we did not make it a complete success. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>In passing in and out, however, enough was seen to show that they are of the most formidable nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The rebels, themselves, both there and in New Orleans, talked of them as impregnable, and expressed a desire to have us attack them there, but feared we would not. He saw some of the torpedoes with which they are filling the channel, and learned of an accident which would seem to show that they are rather more destructive than has been supposed.--During the gale, the <rs>Saturday</rs> before he arrived, their bridge of ferry-boats was blown down the stream, and <num value="1">one</num>, happening to pass over <num value="1">one</num> of these sunken torpedoes, was literally blown to pieces. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> There were about <num value="30000">30,000</num> troops at <placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName>, and some <num value="10000">10,000</num> or <num value="12000">12,000</num> had been sent to <placeName reg="Bowling Green, Warren, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013447">Bowling Green</placeName> within the last <measure n="2weeks" type="date">two weeks</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>The coolness with which the <rs>South</rs> seems to wish to connect its cause forever with that of slavery, and the great principle of free labor on which the prosperity of the <rs>North</rs> rests, do not allow of generous feelings hesitating between the <num value="2">two</num> parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>The most pressing interests must make us desire the prompt conclusion of this crisis, to which a foreign war would give a duration and proportions more dangerous by augmenting the sufferings under which <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and all <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> are indirectly laboring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>Now, the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> crisis cannot terminate but by there establishment of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>The Secessionist doctrine, were it ratified by success, would be for the <name>States</name> of <placeName reg="North America" key="tgn,1000001">North America</placeName>-- for those of the <rs>North</rs> as for those of the <rs>South</rs>--a permanent cause of dissolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>It would again appear everywhere and on every pretext.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>State would separate from State, county from county, district from district.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>They would all fall, as in <placeName reg="South America" key="tgn,1000002">South America</placeName>, into an anarchy, with changing dictatorships raised up and overthrown by violence, as the only remedy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/> If the present civil war be prolonged, or if it be aggravated by a foreign war, the <rs>North</rs> will be obliged to have recourse to the immediate and radical abolition of slavery, to servile war, to those extreme measures which will not repair the mischief, but which will complete the ruin of the <name>South We</name> have already seen by the last message of the <rs>President</rs>, and especially by the propositions presented and discussed in Congress, how difficult it is for the <rs>North</rs> to defend itself against the tendency which leads to these desperate extremes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>We may observe in passing, that since the beginning of this struggle, people in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> have not been just enough towards <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00125" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Thomas,D.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and his friends They have not had sufficient consideration for the reserve these have exhibited on the question of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>They have sought to take away from violence the solution of a problem so formidable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>They have tried to confine the quarrel between them and the secessionists within purely political grounds &mdash; on the question of ascertaining whether the most respectable of all contracts, that on which depends the existence of a constituted State, can be broken at the pleasure of <num value="1">one</num> of the contracting parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>Their moderation will perhaps be vain, but it is of importance that it should be admitted in order to free their responsibility from the terrible consequences which the necessities occasioned to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> by the complications of foreign policy may have for humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>The incident of a war with <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> would be all the more deplorable, as at the present moment a great military event which would be favorable to the cause of the <rs>North</rs> might lead, more rapidly than is believed in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, to the re-establishment of the <rs>Union</rs>.--It must not be forgotten that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> are in <num value="1">one</num> of those revolutionary fits when the moral effect is all powerful, when an accident suffices to change the course of ideas and of facts.

It is, perhaps, at the moment when an effective blow is on the point of being struck that the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> will be surprised by the fatal diversion of a foreign war. We know, in fact, that the capital of the <rs>Union</rs> is nothing now but a vast camp, and that military preparations are become the only thought of the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>After their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> follies the <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> have come to understand that a great war is not organized like a <rs type="role2">President</rs>'s election.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>To introduce discipline they have had to struggle against the influence of the manners and habits of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, against the system of the election of officers by the volunteers, and against the jealous authority of <rs type="role" reg="Governor">Governors</rs> of States interfering between the troops and the central government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>It is, indeed, a strange army, of which it cannot be said whether it be an army of mercenaries, or a national army, or an army of volunteers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>They are mercenaries, as the <name>Southerners</name> call them, insomuch as they take to the profession of arms as a livelihood, and speculate on high pay. But, then, how can they be called mercenaries, as they are not foreigners?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>The soldiers whom the <rs>Union</rs> have got together by hundreds of <num value="1000">thousands</num> represent, quite as well as an army of conscripts, all the classes which compass the nation and reflect its spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>They were provided with all the troops and with every appointment they could wish, and they exerted themselves with a zeal worthy of better success in their important undertaking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>But they were disappointed, baffled, and held back upon the <rs>Kanawha</rs> until winter came on to render their project utterly impracticable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>For the present, that plan of approach is abandoned by the enemy, and our railroad enjoys safe, temporary protection in the rigors of winter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/> Their next plan of attack upon the same line of connection, farther West, was from the direction of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> into <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>, by means of the army of that <num value="9">nine</num>-days' hero of unpronounceable name, <persName n="Sch,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00132" reg="mostcommon:Sch,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Sch</surname></persName>&#x0153;pff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>This movement combined the double advantage of threatening our chief line of railroad leading to the <rs>West</rs>, and of forming the <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName> of the grand <orgName n="Army of Invasion" type="army">army of invasion</orgName> in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>Irrespectively of the design upon the railroad, the movement was an important part of the invasion; and, irrespectively of the invasion, the movement was of value as threatening the railroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>Independently, besides, of both these features, the movement was important as affording countenance to the formidable disaffection in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/> The temporary and accidental success of Sch&#x0153;pff at <placeName reg="Somerset, Pulaski, Kentucky" key="tgn,2041357">Somerset</placeName> has taken the enemy by surprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>They were expecting no victory in that quarter, and their elation at the unexpected and unusual news exceeds all bounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>From small dimensions, the victory grows daily into greater proportions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>It has already been magnified into a full offset to <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>, and is in a fair way to become an <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> <placeName reg="Waterloo, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2753461">Waterloo</placeName> or <placeName reg="Blenheim, Albemarle, Virginia" key="tgn,2179859">Blenheim</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/> We have candidly conceded them a victory; but our loss of life and men little, if at all, exceeds their own; and the balance against us consists at last only of items of animals, wagons, stores, and other mere <hi rend="italics">materiel</hi> of war. The problem remains after all unsolved, whether they can reach our railroad, for if their victory does not secure that result, it sinks into the unimportance of a mere successful frontier skirmish. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/> We are not advised what steps have been taken by our authorities to prevent their approach to the threatened line, but have no doubt that ample provision has been made against such a consummation of a leading movement in the enemy's programme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>Although that great line of road has heretofore been much exposed through mere inadvertence or ignorance of its real value, and left for the most part to take care of itself, it is, so far, we are sure, in no sort of danger.--The number of troops needful for its protection is so small compared with the transcendent importance of the line itself, and its protection is guaranteed by so many weighty considerations, that we think we may safely assume, now that the public authorities have become acquainted with its value, that it will be amply guarded. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/> Turning our attention, therefore, to the great Southern line of railway leading to the gulf States and gulf cities, we find <num value="2">two</num> routes of importance and value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName>, with great sagacity and propriety, urged the completion of this link upon the country in his annual message; but whether Congress has responded to the recommendation by directing the immediate execution of the work, is still involved in the mysteries of their secret conclave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>This much is certain, that the work is not yet accomplished; perhaps it is not yet begun; and the fact remains, that our only line of connection with the <rs>South</rs>, except the <num value="1">one</num> through the mountains of <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">West Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>, is imminently threatened by <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00134" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/> We confess to have lost all apprehension of serious danger or harm to result from the naval expeditions of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>In their history, so far, they have proved unwieldy, inefficient, and frightfully costly to the <rs>Federal</rs> exchequer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>They have inflicted little comparative damage upon us; and in a military point of view, have turned out to be the most wretched abortions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>Great expectations were cherished of <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00135" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>'s armada; and the probabilities are, that it will prove the most stupendous failure of them all. Notwithstanding these things, however, the most harmless weapon that can be employed against our adversary is contempt.

<head>The Recruiting of the army.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/> There is little time for delay &mdash; indeed, no time for delay &mdash; and little for deliberation on this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>The Legislature has had before it the question of recruiting the thinned regiments and meeting <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>'s quota of the army, for nearly <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure>. It was taken up at an early period in <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct>, and here is the end of <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>, and yet no bill is passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>Certainly the grave legislators cannot delay it much longer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/> The Senate yesterday passed a bill embodying the feature of the <q>&#x0022;camps of instruction, &#x0022;</q> which are calculated to involve a large expenditure of money, and will fail to secure that amount of discipline and training which could be acquired in the camps of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>This was the prominent feature of the <orgName n="House Committee" type="committee">House committee</orgName> bill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>We contour with at least <num value="2">two</num> of our contemporaries in the opinion, that <persName n="Tomlin,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00265" reg="mostcommon:Tomlin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Tomlin</surname></persName>'s bill, which we published some days since, is far preferable to either the <orgName n="House Committee" type="committee">House Committee's</orgName> bill or this passed by the <name>Senate</name>, which, indeed, may be the same with that of the <orgName n="House Committee" type="committee">House committee</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/> <persName n="Tomlin,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00266" reg="mostcommon:Tomlin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Tomlin</surname></persName>'s bill has the great recommendation that it provides for enlisting the required number of men, and no more, at a time than are required, and for the rendezvous of these men in the organized camps of the army, where they are blended with the drilled and disciplined troops, and soon acquire their soldierly habits and training.--The manner of enrollment and drafting of his bill is simple and economical, and the men when drafted are assigned to the regular divisions of the army, where the proper stores are provided for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>In filling the quota of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, the <rs>Colonel</rs>'s bill provides that the number of volunteers re-enlisting shall be taken into the account, and that the draft of the militia shall make up the remainder. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/> The Senate bill proposes, as it were, the organization of an entire new army, giving the <rs>Governor</rs> the appointment of all the officers above captain to a <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major General</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>This is likely to introduce a large number of new officers, many of them, probably, untried, who are to drill and discipline men in <placeName reg="Camp of Instruction">camp of instruction</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/>How much better the work will be done in the camps of the army itself?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>How much better will it be to fill up the ranks of the thinned companies and regiments that have seen service and know something about war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>How much better to supply the old buckets with the missing staves?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>Their hoops are tried and reliable, and the new buckets may prove leaky and defective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>The Senate's bill is evidently expensive, and cannot lead to the same prompt and effective results that will be attained by that of <persName n="Tomlin,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00267" reg="mostcommon:Tomlin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Tomlin</surname></persName>. </p> </div3>

<head>The plot thickens.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/> The plot of the great crusade of Yankeedom for the subjugation of the <rs>South</rs> thickens as the <q>&#x0022;<num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> act&#x0022;</q> of the drama progresses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>The curtain has risen upon that act, as we believe, and the play will go on with tolerable rapidity to the denouement in which the villain is exposed and punished, and the wrong righted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/> The Northern press has been for weeks on the tip-toe of expectation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>They have repeated with increased energy the off-heralded prediction that the rebels would be, in a few days, surrounded, and rebellion crushed out. They have predicted falsely so many times about the onward movement of their grand armies, and the striking of the final blow, that little faith is to be put in what they say; but the wolf may come at last, however often the false warning may be repeated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>From the signs apparent in the naval preparations, and the movements and the man&#x0153;uvering of the land troops of the enemy, it may be fairly inferred that the threatened blow is soon to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>It is, probably, only delayed now by the condition of the roads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>Yesterday was a bright sunny day, and such a day brings out the adder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/>A few of such days would make an improvement in the roads and bring on some fighting; but, whether this be the case or not, we may fairly infer that the next <measure n="60days" type="date">sixty days</measure> will be marked by some very bloody battles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>Lincolndom staggers under a load of debt and grows desperate at the waning of public confidence at the <rs>North</rs> in the <rs>Government</rs> and the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>Longer delays will be, in their opinion, fatal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>The credit of the <rs>Government</rs>, the confidence of the people, must be revived by a bold movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>Even <persName n="Russell,Lord,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00268" reg="default:Russell,John,,,"><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName> has declared that the absence of a great victory for the <name>Federalists</name> by the last of <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct> will be fatal to the <rs>Government</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/> The blow will, therefore, soon fall; but we shall be well prepared to parry it, and deal the enemy <num value="1">one</num> which he will not recover from so easily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>Yet it behooves our people to arouse themselves from the lethargy of a long repose and elevate themselves to a level with the exigency &mdash; that they shall fully understand the desperate and expiring struggle of the enemy, and meet it with that vigor and resolution which are necessary to resist and defeat him. We have the power, we have the courage, we have the resolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>Nothing will enable the enemy to make headway, and gain important advantages, but the apathy of prolonged inaction. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/> The <num value="4">four</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> expeditions by sea against the <rs>South</rs>, have as yet accomplished nothing important.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>Their equipment must have afforded an immense demand on the merchant marine of the <rs>Northern</rs> cities, and their conception may be probably due to <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> cunning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/> When we came to the support of our country, in its struggle for existence, we were jealous of our more fortunate comrades, who were armed and placed at once upon the post of danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>We were clamorous for active service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>Was this because we had a passion for war which would cease with the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> rude encounter, and a thirst for cheaply-earned laurels, which would be satisfied if we won the applause of the people on a single battle-field?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>Or did we feel the truth of our condition &mdash; that all the treasures of the past and the hopes of the future were to be saved or lost, as we might be true to ourselves and the country, or false to our homes, our families, and to the cause of true Constitutional liberty? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/> The answer to these questions must determine the course of such men as are guided by principle, and to none other than these can the country look for its defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>Let us answer them with perfect candor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>If we rushed to the field for the defence of our native land &mdash; its soil that has nourished us; its people who are <q>&#x0022;bone of our bone,&#x0022;</q> and whose hearts are burdened with hopes and prayers for our safety and honor; its Government, Constitution, and laws, which furnish the only security left us for the preservation of life liberty, and property, we must remain in the field until these purposes are accomplished, or else, by our conduct, announce to the world that these things are not worth fighting for, or that we are not the men to fight for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>If we took up arms in a romantic love of adventure, and intended to lay them down when the real trials of warfare should come upon us, we will serve our country best by leaving the field to men who will endure every hardship which lays in our path to independence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/> In this light our actions will be read by our shrewd enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>Every man who now recedes from the field will weaken the army more than in proportion to his value as a soldier, and add strength to the enemy in a still greater proportion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>It has been evident, from the time we <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> measured arms with our oppressors, and they learned to dread the valor of the <rs>Southern</rs> patriot- soldier, that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have been employing every art of war to avoid further battles, and with their control of the seaboard, and their superior numbers, to keep us harassed with various threatening expeditions, in the hope to annoy, divide, and weaken us. They have taken comfort to themselves, while they have <q>&#x0022;calculated&#x0022;</q> that we would become restive in camp and behind breastworks, and disgusted with the fatigue duties which the character of their movements would necessarily entail upon us. They have believed that our patriotism was but a bubble; that our zeal was but a freak of passion; that our faith was no more than a whim; that our courage was only a fit of temper; that we would be impatient of toil, and fretful under suffering, and that they could, by superior powers of endurance, win a triumph which they dared not put at stake upon the field of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>Shall we fulfill all their base hopes and cold calculations by withdrawing from the struggle at the moment that our greatest sacrifice is demanded, and when such an act would expose our country to almost certain disaster? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/> What will cause us to lay down the arms we so eagerly raised <num value="1">one</num> year ago, and to abandon the flag we have watched and followed with so much devotion?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>Some, I admit, will be called home by the honorable desire to provide for the maintenance and protection of their dependent families.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>Those who took the field at the sacrifice of these tender relations at home, evinced the highest possible devotion to their country, and, in some instances, it would be wrong for them to remain in the service, till they have had an opportunity to make provision for their families.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>But in such a time and for such a cause as this, every man who can bear arms should count himself a soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>No man can, now or hereafter, be called by the endearing name of patriot who remains at home merely because he has more care for his household than he has for his country.--If all the heads of families remain at home while the young men do the fighting, our independence will at last be won, if ever, at the expense of a generation who had but little voice in those grand acts and declarations which we have assembled our armies to defend and make good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>The older men will have the questionable glory of voting themselves independent at the expense of the blood of men who fight but do not vote. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/> I know and feel as you do, my comrades, that such considerations have often arisen in our minds and touched our hearts, as we have watched the border in the lonely vigils of the outpost, and have toiled in the hot sun and amidst the cold frosts for our country's cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>But armed with the consciousness that, with all, we did no more than our duty, and upheld in our hearts by the sentiment that we had the approval of the <name n="God" type="God">God</name> of truth and justice to sustain us, we have only desired to meet every danger fairly in the face, and have not inquired who else should have been present to share it with us. Such will still be our feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>If all that remain at home shall continue to content themselves with ease, comfort, and safety, rather than share with us the toils of camp and the dangers of the field, we shall be content to assign the humble part of gracing a triumph they are unworthy to assist in winning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>If they leave the field to its, they must not expect to share our laurels, nor to escape the just verdict of coming generations upon their conduct. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/> If they are willing to remain at home and enrich themselves by speculating on the necessities of the soldiers, it will only be an evil which will cause the country, in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> joy of its triumph, to spurn them from its bosom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>Let us not descend to that level, because, for the moment, it seems to glitter with ill-gotten gain, and to promise dishonorable ease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>We have set out for a nobler destiny; let us never falter or look back-ward on the unfinished furrow. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/> When we go home, let it be to homes redeemed by our valor from the hands of the vandal oppressor and destroyer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>Let us go as freemen, entitled to a hearty welcome to honored homes, and not as half-whipped seekers after the comforts and pleasures of a society that would be ashamed of us. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/> Many of you are men of wealth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>Shall the poor man, who stands by your side in the ranks, have it to say of you that you fled to the shades of luxurious homes, while he stood defying all the terrors of climate and of battle in your defence?

<head>[for the <orgName n="Richmond Dispatch" type="newspaper">Richmond Dispatch</orgName>.]<lb/>the volunteer question.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/> The necessities of the war, in which we are engaged, demand the most careful consideration; and nothing should be left undone that is necessary to keep our regiments full, and ensure to our army the greatest efficiency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/>In submitting what follows I am not moved by self conceit, but by a desire to contribute my mite, if haply it be a mite. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/> It is generally conceded that a protracted war cannot be efficiently prosecuted without regulars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>Volunteers for the war are regulars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>To induce men to enlist for the war a bounty of <measure n="50dollars" type="currency">fifty dollars</measure> is paid; as a bounty &mdash; that is all right, and well enough as far as it goes, but <hi rend="italics">does it go far enough?</hi> I think not, and I will give my reasons, such as they are, for my opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>Many patriotic men are poor, and have a mother, a wife, and children, or helpless brothers and sisters dependent upon them &mdash; and all these poor patriots possess is their personal effort; they live and sustain their loved ones by the sweat of their brows Such men cannot afford to go in the army during the war, as our affairs are now regulated, because, if they perish in battle, or by diseases and casualties incident to war, they will leave their families utterly destitute.--What should be done to obviate this difficulty?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>It is only necessary for the present &mdash; till a better system can be matured &mdash; to let the pay, of such soldiers continue, if they perish in war, to their families &mdash; say, if it is a mother of the soldier, during her life &mdash; if it is his widow, during her life, or widowhood &mdash; if it be his orphans, till the youngest attain the age of <num value="16">sixteen</num>--if his brothers and sisters till the youngest is old enough to be put to learn a trade, or to some honest way of making a living.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>With this regulation by law, made at once, in addition to the <measure n="50dollars" type="currency">$50</measure> bounty--<num value="1000">thousands</num>, before the spring, would enroll their names for the war. This privilege should be allowed to those now in the service as well as to those who are out. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/> It would not interfere with the companies nor regiments now in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>All that is necessary is to get them enrolled, when they could be arranged into companies and proper officers assigned, and the day <num value="1">one</num> service expired the other would begin, and no confusion take place, and our army would present the same compact form to our foes that it does now, and be far more efficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/>It may be objected that this arrangement would enhance the expenses of the war, and make our war debt ultimately more onerous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>Grant it, and what of it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>No <num value="1">one</num> abhors more than I do wasteful and needless expenditure, and no <num value="1">one</num> despises more than I do that <q>&#x0022;penny- wise and pound-foolish&#x0022;</q> economy that hesitates to meet all wise and proper expenditure of war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/> This war we <hi rend="italics">must</hi> fight, and more than that we <hi rend="italics">must </hi> conquer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/>It is not in our power to decline the combat, if we were craven enough to desire to do so, <hi rend="italics">but fight we must.</hi> Upon this wager of battle all that is dear to man is suspended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/>Win it, and the sun never shone upon so glorious and free, so rich and prosperous a people as we soon shall be. Lose it, and the soul sickens at the picture, our country ravaged, our homes destroyed, our altars defiled, our mothers, wives, sisters and daughters outraged, and we should go forth (despoiled of all that elevates and ennobles man and makes life tolerable) degraded and debased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/>It is but the miser's trick, who chaffers with the under taker to cheapen his coffin, to withhold any expense that will really tend, however remotely, to victory, for with us it is indeed victory or death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/><placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> forgets not the families of her soldiers, and <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>'s example, in this regard, is well worthy of imitation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/> Our volunteers have done nobly, and many of them seem to scorn the <measure n="50dollars" type="currency">$50</measure> bounty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>Very well, I rather like that, it shows their patriotism is still burning brightly; may it ever burn, and grow ever more brilliant, and be always as it now is, the glory of our nascent Confederacy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/> There are those, however, who feel an equal ardor for their country who are too poor to carry their ardent feelings into action &mdash; unless they have assurance that their loved ones at home are safe from want.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/>The domestic affections are, as well as patriotism, manly and noble &mdash; and indeed he makes but a poor patriot whose heart is dead to this elevating and refining love.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/>It is easy for a man in easy circumstances to go forth to battle for his home and country, when he knows his loved ones will not suffer; but it is hard for a brave boy to go forth on a like errand, and leave a poor old mother in want at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/>The Confederacy must be her son and care for the beloved old mother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/>I know of a noble old mother who has but <num value="2">two</num> boys, she sent them both to battle, and was only sorry she did not have a dozen more to sent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>These dear old heroines must not be humiliated by depending upon private charity &mdash; they are the mothers of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and have made it what it is, <name n="God" type="God">God</name> for ever bless them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/> Let those who do not desire the bounty, nor need any after care of their families, volunteer as they did at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and nobody will complain, but love them all the more for it. And it will be well for our rulers to beware how they lay their hands rudely upon the volunteer system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/>We owe them everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>What would have been our condition but for the noble enthusiasm of our brave young men, the generosity of the rich, and the devotion of our women?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/>Long, long ago, some <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> would have lorded over every household.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>Again I say, let our rulers bewares how they lay their hands rudely upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/>They are our sons and brothers, and nobly have they vindicated their own and their country's honor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/> Nobody cares how heavily the <name>Legislature</name> or Congress may bear upon the sleek, greasy, lazy loons who have been deaf to her country's call in the hour of danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/>Get them out any way, and for any length of time you please; nobody cares. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/> To the volunteer, hold out the lure of promotion for valor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>Napoleon the <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> understood that charm and conjured with it, and he was a mighty magician in the art of making heroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/>For a deed of more than ordinary daring, whether done by an officer or private he was sure of his reward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/>The badge of the <name>Legion</name> of Honor put him in the way of promotion and made him famous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="828"/>In our army, all such cases should be reported at once to the <rs>President</rs>, and suitable notice taken of it. <hi rend="smallcaps">Beta.</hi> </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
