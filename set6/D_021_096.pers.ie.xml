<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/> The importance of interior lines to forces superior on the whole in point of numbers has been frequently demonstrated in practice, and never until a few years ago disputed in theory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>The preservation of these lines has led to some of the most memorable achievements recorded in the history of war. It was by means of an interior line that the <rs>Consul Nero</rs> was enabled to cut off Assumable upon the <name>Metaurus</name> with the forces he was leading to the succor of his <persName><roleName n="Brother">brother</roleName> <foreName>Hannibal</foreName></persName>, and thus render all the victories of that great commander a nullity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>It was by means of interior lines that the great <rs>Frederic</rs> was enabled to resist the combined power of <placeName reg="Austria" key="tgn,1000062">Austria</placeName>, <placeName reg="Rossiya" key="tgn,7002435">Russia</placeName>, and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, defeating their armies <num value="1">one</num> after the other, and never allowing them to unite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>These <num value="3">three</num> powers invaded his dominions from <num value="3">three</num>-quarters of the compass &mdash; the <name>Bast</name>, the <rs>North</rs>, and the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>With a vastly inferior force on the whole, being placed in the centre, his marches were shorter, and he could prevent their uniting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>He attacked each of them in detail, and was thus enabled on every field to present a force not greatly inferior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>Had he waited for them to unite they would easily have overwhelmed him. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>This mode of unloading developed the fact, that between the plunger, containing the cap and the plate on which it strikes, cotton had been introduced, thus preventing concussion and consequent explosion when the shell struck the ground. </p>
