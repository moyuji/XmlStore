<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>When we take into consideration the destruction and rapine perpetrated by the <rs>Federals</rs> in this country, the forbearance and moderation of our own soldiers, many of whose homes were lying in ashes, approach the sublime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> cannot attribute this humane conduct of the men of the <rs>South</rs> to fear of retaliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>Many of those gallant men had already suffered all that the enemy could inflict in this way; their farms were already desolated; they had no longer a house to be burned; all that revenge could lay hold of, it had already taken and destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>Moreover, they had before them the experience of <num value="2">two</num> campaigns in the <rs>North</rs>, in which their uniform respect for private property had been repaid by houses plundered and burned, women and children robbed of their <rs n="wearing apparel" type="product">wearing apparel</rs>, and sometimes visited with the most shocking fate; mills and provisions destroyed, and every effort employed to reduce the country to starvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>Under such provocations, the civilization, the humane and <name>Christian</name> spirit manifested in the last invasion of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> ought to challenge the admiration of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>But experience has taught us not to expect the plaudits of the world, but to look to the approbation of that Power which has been our sole support in this contest, and whose favor is worth more than that of all the potentates of the earth. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/> Nevertheless, it is not without importance to appear before the nations and before posterity with such a record as the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> can show.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>The world had been taught to regard us before this war as <num value="0.5">a half</num>-civilized and bloody-minded people, cruel to our slaves, hot-headed and ferocious to our equals, without sentiments of humanity or religion, and destitute of true manly pith and vigor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>The war has disabused them of many of their errors, and it will vindicate our real character beyond quibble or exception, if we persevere to the end. It will then be seen that humanity, that forbearance to the weak and helpless, that self-respect and self- control are as pre-eminently Southern qualities as the magnificent courage which has extorted from all mankind shouts of admiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>We owe it to ourselves and to our children that, whether we sink or swim, survive or perish, we do no injustice by any act of ours to the sublime virtues we have inherited from our ancestors.--If we fall, let us not lose both our honor and our cause.
