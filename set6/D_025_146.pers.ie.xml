<head>Confederates abroad.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/> Amid the general privations and heroic exertions of our people, it is gratifying to know that the <rs>Confederates</rs> abroad are enduring with unexampled fortitude their separation from their native land, and their afflicting deprivation of the labors and renown in arms which their brethren at home are achieving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>It is distressing to think that these unhappy exiles can have no share in the deliverance of their beloved country from its oppressors, and that their posterity will not be able to point to their names on the emblazoned scroll which will hand down to future ages the bronzed and immortal veterans who are carving out with their good swords such a heritage of glory as <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName> and <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> never won. The ragged raiment, the bare and bleeding feet, the couch of winter snows with its canopy of Heaven, the terrific battle shock, and the graves where sleep, are all denied the homesick exiles of the sunny <rs>South</rs>, who, imprisoned in the splendid capitals of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, pine like caged eagles to wrestle with the tempest and bare their bosoms to the thunderbolt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>The captive crusader, looking out from his rugged tower upon the embattled host of his warlike brethren passing by to humble the proud <rs>Moslem</rs>, and, amid the cheering blasts of their wild clarions, failing to hear his cry for deliverance, must have felt pangs akin to those which rend the bosoms of those distressed Confederates, whom <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> blockaders and a stern sense of duty to themselves are chaining to the inglorious security of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/> No man with a man's heart would willingly leave his country at such an hour as this, and therefore we can easily imagine the pangs which rend the bosoms of our expatriated brethren.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>To be compelled to stand aloof from <num value="1">one</num>'s friends when in adversity, to be obliged to go out when burglars are working away at the old mansion house where <num value="1">one</num> was born, and to know that the lives of those who nourished and played with us in our childhood, and whose blood runs in our veins, are in imminent peril, whilst we are constrained to look helplessly on from a neighbor's window, is a refinement of torture enough to lacerate the toughest sensibilities, and to drive Reason from her throne.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>Such is the sad condition of our unhappy brethren in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>Who can depict the anguish of their souls?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>Every gale from the east seems burthened with their plaintive sighs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>Surrounded on all hands by revilers of their domestic institutions, and living under Governments which studiously ignore the existence of their country, they are doomed to a condition of isolation and orphanage in comparison with which the crimson wreck of a battle- field and the red flames of the midnight conflagration are agreeable and animating spectacles. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/> But there is no condition of humanity bereft of all consolation, and it is pleasing to discover occasionally from foreign journals, and other vehicles of intelligence, that, whilst the minds of Confederates abroad are subjected to unspeakable tortures, their bodies are not denied the creature comforts which may be picked up here and there in <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> capitals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>We rejoice to know that they have at least enough to eat, drink, and wear; that the roast beef of Merry <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and the choice vintages of gallant <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> solace their desponding spirits; that they are much admired and sought after in social circles, and sometimes give vent to their unearthly patriotism at the festive board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>It must be a touching sight to see them swallowing with convulsive throats an alderman's turtle, permitting the <rs>Good Samaritans</rs> of <placeName reg="Liverpool, Liverpool, England" key="tgn,7010597">Liverpool</placeName> and <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> to pour oil and wine into their bleeding wounds, and drinking in solemn silence to the memory of <persName n="Jackson,,Stonewall,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00187" reg="default:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><foreName>Stonewall</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>Let us hope that, by these merciful appliances, they may be enabled to survive the rigors of their separation from desolate homes and from fields where brave men fight and fall, and that &#x0022;when this cruel war is over&#x0022; they will throng back to us like swallows in the spring. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
