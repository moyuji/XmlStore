<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>Advancing slowly over an admirable road for <measure n="7miles" type="distance">seven miles</measure>, we fatied, during the march, of encountering the enemy, who had prudently recolled from a meeting until it should take place beyond the range of our gunboats, although the nature of the ground over which we passed afforded many excellent positions for defence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/> The read alternated through dense woods and through marches, only passable over a narrow causeway, save at <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>Choosing a position at the opposite and of this causeway, the enemy opened a furious fire of shell and canister on our advancing column which was promptly met by the battery under <persName n="Henry,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00081" reg="mostcommon:Henry,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut</roleName> <surname>Henry</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>After a brisk <unclear></unclear> of both musketry and artillery, the rebels retied to the dense woods in their rear, tearing up the causeway bridge which delayed the advance of our artillery until it could be repaired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>Meanwhile the <orgName type="regiment" key="1Brigade">First brigade</orgName> pressed on to the woods, which they penetrated, driving the enemy before tham, and closely followed by the <orgName type="regiment" key="2Brigade">Second brigade</orgName>, under <persName n="Terry,,Gen,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00082" reg="default:Terry,Gen,,,"><foreName>Gen</foreName> <surname>Terry</surname></persName>, who came up with a cheer and were quickly in the engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>Here the fight, it may be said, fairly commenced &mdash; the enemy's sharpshooters picking off our men rapidly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>The artillery fire from our side was not slackened while the bridge was being repaired, and it was not long before the batteries went forward to the work in support of the infantry. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/> It is a singular fact that while the <rs>English</rs> prem has become well aware of the systematic lying in which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> indulge, and therefore place no reliance in their statements generally, it yet seems to regard the campaign in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> as an affair of far more importance than it is possible to assign to it when the results are taken into consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>It is still more singular that, in estimating the importance of these results they leave out of view altogether the capture of a large army, nearly <num value="12000">12,000</num> strong, with <num value="73">seventy three</num> cannon, an immense amount of ammunition and stores, with <num value="15000">15,000</num> stand of arms, by the <rs>Confederates</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>Can it be that in the editions designed for <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> the proprietors of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> papers were ordered by <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00227" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> to omit all allusion to this disaster!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>We should hardly think it possible to carry such an order into execution, and yet we cannot account for the silence of the <rs>British</rs> press in any other way than by supposing the writers ignorant of the circumstance.
