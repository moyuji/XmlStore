<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/> My <rs type="role2">Lord</rs>, Ladies and Gentlemen: As it has happened to me <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> times in Parliament to refer to the topic now before you, it is not with a little satisfaction I observe in the numbers who have met to-night and in the spirit they evince same augury for the ultimate adoption and the final triumph of these opinions I have endeavored to support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/><persName n="Spence,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00073" reg="mostcommon:Spence,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Spence</surname></persName>, under whose orders and instructions I have the honor to address you, has judiciously explained to me that to-night it was not necessary to indulge in argumentative harangues, because the greater part of us were of <num value="1">one</num> opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>After the long and assiduous discussions which this topic has received in the press, in Parliament, and in public meetings, it is no wonder that nearly all men should agree on certain propositions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>We do see upon certain propositions a remarkable agreement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>Few deny that the cessation of the civil war in question can only take place when neutral powers have acknowledged the insurgents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>Few deny that <sic>that</sic> acknowledgement ought not to be anticipated, in the present state of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> and the world, until <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> has shown a certain disposition to initiate or sanction it. Few deny that in the present state of parties and of Parliament the <rs>British Government</rs> will not show the required disposition until public opinion strongly urges and decidedly encourages it. This sufficiently illustrates the political and practical utility of a meeting like the present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>Gentlemen, if ever agitation was essential on this subject it is at the present moment, when certain dangers have arrived and certain circumstances have disclosed themselves which might, unless properly examined, tend to inspire doubt and distrust in the event of Southern independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>Those dangers and those circumstances ought not to be, nor indeed need they be, connived at. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/> The Southern <rs type="role2">President</rs> has not set us the example of ignoring or concealing them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>He has not hesitated to fix the attention of the world upon the fact that in the past year unforeseen reverses have been suffered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>He has not scrupted to advert to the events of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> and <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>The whole world, in common with the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, deplores the loss of <persName n="Jackson,,Stonewall,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00074" reg="default:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><foreName>Stonewall</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>.--All those who are interested in the fate of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> must have heard with regret and with anxiety that the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName> which some months ago seemed to augur well for the cause of peace and separation, has grown more silent, more subdued, and less effective than it used to be.--These are undoubtedly circumstances of discouragement, but as I think, grounds for agitation and activity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>There is this grand reason gentlemen, why these circumstances of discouragement ought not be considered motives of despondency amongst; us &mdash; they have not shaken the <rs>Confederacy</rs>; they have not quenched the spirit which upholds it; they have not chilled the hopes which it indulges; on the contrary, we have good reason to believe that in spite of the darker picture I have pointed to, there never was a moment when their discipline was of a higher character their armies more insure, the <rs>Generals</rs> more skillful, their strategy more perfect, their resolution more undaunted, or their readiness, if necessary, to take new regards more complete. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/> When they themselves are thus undaunted by realities it would ill become their friends in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> to be affected by a shadow and a reflex.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>I have therefore ventured to allude to those unfavorable circumstances, and also to show why they ought not to lead to a diminished hope or a discouraged spirit upon your part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>Gentlemen, it that be so, if the ends of this association are legitimate, which I have not ventured to establish, knowing that such is not a question in this room, if at the present moment those ends ought to be pursued with more zeal and more activity than ever, it is not irrelevant or idle to consider what is the most important and formidable obstacle opposing you, Gentlemen, I cannot help thinking that the most formidable obstacle, looking to the public mind, looking to all that has been said and is said daily on these questions, is summed up in the well-known term, &#x0022;slavery.&#x0022; I cannot help thinking that if a just opinion were established on that subject &mdash; and it is your mission to establish and <sic>desseminete</sic> it &mdash; no further obstacles could very long delay the triumph of your principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>And if you would allow me, I would venture &mdash; having given some consideration and reflection to that point in reference to Parliamentary proceedings &mdash; to suggest a mode by which, as it appears to me, what you hold to be the truth, might be brought home to the convictions in all classes of society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>If it were only thoroughly explained by this organization that the <rs>British</rs> public has to look merely to <num value="1">one</num> which this war must terminate &mdash; for there are but <num value="2">two</num>--the separation of the belligerents or the conquest of the <rs>South</rs> by the <rs>North</rs> will tend most to the advantage of the negro race?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>If that were steadily contemplated, if that issue were relieved and disembarrassed of all the rival issues that confess it, I do not think there would remain a difference of opinion in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>No doubt there will always be, as there has been up to this moment both here and on the other side of the <rs>Atlantic</rs>, a difference of opinion as to how the war originated, as to the motives for which it was undertaken, as to the objects of the <rs>South</rs> in asserting independence, and of the <rs>Union</rs> in waging war against secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>These questions are more or less difficult to settle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>But if we fix our minds upon the only point it is material to weigh namely, whether the independence, or the subjugation of the <rs>South</rs> will really tend most to that which in this country all have at <unclear></unclear>--the amelioration of the negro &mdash; little difficulty, as it appears to me, will be found in reaching a conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>The history of the world does much to suggest <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>It has generally been found that when in any country <num value="2">two</num> races are brought together, of which <num value="1">one</num> is vastly the superior in force, in vigor and intelligence, unless some known relation exists between those <num value="2">two</num> races, the weaker is exterminated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>Now, should the <rs>Confederacy</rs> be subdued, and should reconquest be established over all the great territory that lies between the <placeName reg="Gulf of Mexico" key="tgn,7021009">Gulf of Mexico</placeName> and the <rs>Potomac</rs>, <num value="2">two</num> races would be found so unequal, so incompatible, so bereft of the original relation by which they had been <sic>previoully</sic> cemented, as at east to augur the extermination and the disappearance of the weaker <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>But we are not left to speculations of this character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>It happens that this very day, not many hours ago, a letter in a leading <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> newspaper has reached <placeName reg="Manchester, Manchester, England" key="tgn,7010477">Manchester</placeName> from the other side of the <rs>Atlantic</rs>, which gives the best and the latest information on this question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>In that letter it is pointed out in what manner the invasion by the <rs>North</rs> has influenced the prospects and position of the negro. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/> As far as I remember the writer, speaking from what has fallen, and that recently, under his eyes and his experience, gives a fourfold division of that unhappy class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>He points to those who are the victims of a forcible enlistment compelled to take arms, exposed to the brunt of battle in a cause which they detest and for a people who despise them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>He points to another class who have gone to the <rs>Northwestern States</rs> in quest of employment, and who have not found it. He points to <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> class, who, in consequence of an infectious disorder which attacks them, are miserably dying in the capital at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>He points to another glass who are <sic>coarsed</sic> to labor upon the soil which has been occupied and upon the estates which have been confiscated by Northern plunderers, and whose condition, as he points out to us, is infinitely worse than that from which they have been wrested; for, of freedom they have gained nothing except the fact that they are no longer under shelter; that they are no longer cared for; that they are introduced to the double evils of responsibility and servitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>This is the latest eye-witness who addresses to the public of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> the facts he has observed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>But supposing him to be mistaken, supposing that improvement is attainable, and assuming that great measures ought not to be despaired of for the welfare of the negro &mdash; this, at least, gentlemen, I think, may be hazarded with safety before any audience who look to the great principles by which human nature is controlled and by which the world is governed, viz: that those measures of improvement must be loyal, must be well intentioned, must be designed for the good of the negro, and not for the destruction of the planter. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>It is a gloom which must befall a population conscious of their rights, and mindful of their origin, but held down by a foreign occupation of <num value="20000">20,000</num> men; a gloom of which no man can walk abroad without observing dark and melancholy faces; where no citizen can leave his home without meeting a patrol, entitled, according to its orders, or perhaps its caprices, to arrest him; and where, when he returns to that home which ought to be a sanctuary, he has to look forward to the probability of midnight visitation, more destructive than the snares by which his footsteps had been haunted. </p>
