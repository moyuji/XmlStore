<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>He dropped in upon us in a neighborly way, and was received with immense hospitality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>At that time, though a young man, he was in the meridian of his fame, and his popularity, in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> as in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, was unbounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>We greeted him with a perfect <hi rend="italics">furore</hi> of enthusiasm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>There were some people who thought we rather over-did the matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>They said we went down upon all-fours, as it were, before this promising whelp of the <rs>British</rs> lion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>But the truth is, there never was a more genuine outburst of good feeling than that which the great mass of our people displayed towards <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Dickens,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00267" reg="nearbymention:Dickens,Charles,,,"><surname>Dickens</surname></persName>.</hi> Some flunkyism there was, as there always will be, but the most of us loved Boz like a brother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>We identified the man with his works, and his works had always been true to humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>We were his debtors for a vast amount of fun, and, what was better, he had taught us to sympathize with the poor and suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>He had never degraded his pen by servility to rank and power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>His heroes and heroines had been always of the common mould, and when a nobleman figured in his productions it was not much to his advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>Such a genius and such a nature as shone in his pages touched an electric chord in the soul of this <rs n="Republican" type="political">republican</rs> country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/> His <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> speech at a Boston festival rather opened our eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>Those sentiments, to live long, must be somewhat reciprocal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>No <num value="1">one</num> can dispute the justice of such a law, and it ought to have been enacted long ago, but we had not expected to be lectured on our shortcomings at that time, in that way, and by that man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>But the festivities to <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Dickens,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00269" reg="nearbymention:Dickens,Charles,,,"><surname>Dickens</surname></persName></hi> went on all the same, and his progress through the country was a perfect ovation. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>We expected it would be a candid, just and somewhat friendly estimate of our national character and habits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>We did not look for anything very philosophical or profound, but had the right to anticipate a brilliant and good-humored portraiture of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>There were some who predicted we should catch it, but it was believed that if satirized at all, it would be in such artistic style that we should enjoy our own dissection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>But we were all to be grievously disappointed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>The book overflowed with gall and venom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/> The people of this city and District are to have the opportunity next Thursday of expressing their views as to the propriety of giving the right of suffrage to negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>It has already been announced that a bill for this purpose has passed both branches of the <orgName n="City Council" type="council">City Council</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>It has since received the approval of <persName n="Wallack,Mayor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00405" reg="mostcommon:Wallack,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mayor">Mayor</roleName> <surname>Wallack</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>Of course there is not the least probability that the vote will be in favor of any such privilege to the <rs n="African" type="ethnic">Africans</rs>; and there is as little that the <name>Radicals</name> in Congress will pay any respect whatever to the voice of the lawful white voters of the <rs>District</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/> It is understood that a bill is to be introduced into Congress to repeal the charter of the city of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and to confide its administration and police affairs to <num value="2">two</num> Commissioners, to be appointed by the <rs>National Executive</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>The object of this is to deprive the people of the <rs>District</rs> of all suffrage, and thus to get rid of the vexed question of Negro Suffrage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>A very happy riddance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/>It will much promote the quiet and order of the good people of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>Politics and elections are a great trouble to communities! </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/>The <hi rend="italics">Intelligencer</hi> bears testimony to the truth of these statements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>It says further, &#x0022;that many of the soldiers (black) were enrolled in the spring of <dateStruct value="1864--"><year reg="1864">1864</year></dateStruct> for the <rs>Massachusetts</rs> colored cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>For each of these recruits that State paid a bounty of <num value="3">three</num> <sic>hunded</sic> and <measure n="25dollars" type="currency">twenty-five dollars</measure>, and the towns and cities paid an additional bounty of <num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num> to <measure n="200dollars" type="currency">two hundred dollars</measure> for each recruit.&#x0022; That truthful journal adds: <q>&#x0022;It is a fact, susceptible of the clearest proof, that none of these recruits ever received over <measure n="300dollars" type="currency">three hundred dollars</measure>. Of the residue of this bounty they were robbed by Government officials and <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> agents. * * * Could the facts connected with these wicked transactions be fully spread to the country, it would awaken a tempest of just indignation, and cause <hi rend="italics">all good men to blush for the heartless depravity of their species.</hi>&#x0022;</q> No doubt of it! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/> It is understood that Congress is solicited by influential citizens to purchase the ground on the north side of the city known as the <rs>Washington J. Berry</rs> property, for the purpose of erecting thereupon a mansion for the <rs>President</rs>, with a magnificent park attached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>The ground has an area of between <num value="3">three</num> and <measure n="400acres" type="area">four hundred acres</measure>. The property is advertised for sale on the <dateStruct value="--21"><day reg="21">21st instant</day></dateStruct>, and hence the spur is used to hasten up Congress to the rescue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>It is very plain that the tolerably spacious and moderately presentable mansion of the <rs>National Executive</rs> is much below the grandeur of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> in its enlarged and overshadowing sphere; and whether the <rs>Washington J. Berry</rs> property be purchased or not, a more gorgeous palace will have to be awarded to the <rs type="role" reg="Chief Magistrate">Chief Magistrate</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>What would answer for other days will not do for these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>The Department at the western end of <address><street n="Pennsylvania avenue">Pennsylvania avenue</street></address> must have equal consideration with that at the eastern end. If Congress deliberates in super-splendid marble halls, the high officer who holds the veto power over its acts, and is chief of a co-ordinate branch of the <rs>Government</rs>, must have the equal honors of lavish expenditures upon the finest edifices that the genius of architecture can conceive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>This is but right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>Congress has no right to appropriate all the money for building purposes to its elegant ease and convenience. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>It is supposed that <num value="40000">forty thousand</num> blacks are now within her limits, <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> of whom were slaves at the beginning of the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>The chief difference is said to lie in the opposition in views with regard to a proposed early move upon the &#x0022;enemy's works.&#x0022; It is supposed that the military chieftain of <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName>, with the views from either side before him, will take sides with <persName n="Mahoney,President,O.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00409" reg="default:Mahoney,O.,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <foreName>O.</foreName> <surname>Mahoney</surname></persName>; for the present, at all events. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/> Upon the whole, the breach is apparently widening, and should the early contemplated move be attempted, the general opinion seems to be that it will terminate in a complete abortion. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/> The courts of the city present to the world a frightful record of crime and vice.
