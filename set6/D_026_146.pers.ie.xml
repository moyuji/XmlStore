<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>A large body of their forces left Big Shanty about <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time> in the morning and marched in battle order on our left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>Some <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> later they accidentally discovered <persName n="Bates,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00214" reg="nearbymention:Bates,E.,W.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bates</surname></persName>'s position, which was some distance beyond our main line, and a heavy fight soon raged in the woods where our forces were posted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>The rear of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> column was hurried up, and the fight continued about an hour, when the enemy retired. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>Large bodies of the enemy continued to pour out from their centre, and at a point about <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> from our lines, separated to the right and left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>A heavy skirmish commenced about noon on our right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>The enemy advanced a strong line of skirmishes half way across a large field, where the deadened limber furnished them a good shelter, but after an hours' sharp skirmishing they retired rapidly, carrying with them several who had fallen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>A heavy thunder storm occurred at this time, but rapid skirmishing continued unabated up to nightfall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>His entrenchments confront our centre and the main road, from which his army debouches into position on the wings &mdash; it was very evident that he was making a grand movement, from the rapidity with which his large bodies were thrown forward as they came up. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/> He established his wagon station in the fields to the left of Big Shanty, and as the long trains of wagons arrived the men were thrown forward in <num value="3">three</num> and <num value="4">four</num> lines of battle, from which they were forwarded into position on our immediate front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>We discerned a heavy movement far to the rear of Big Shanty, the evident intention of which was a movement toward the <placeName reg="Canton, Madison, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056100">Canton</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7014362" n="1.000 4" reg="roswell, fulton, georgia">Roswell</placeName> road, but no firing occurred in that direction. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>During the day they continued to increase rapidly until all the open space on the left of Big. Shanty was covered, and at sunset were estimated at over <num value="3000">three thousand</num> in number.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>An immense drove of cattle also followed close in the march of their army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>About <time value="4oclock">four o'clock</time> in the evening the shrieks of their railroad trains were heard, and in a few minutes the cars rolled into.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>Our soldiers set up a defiant yell, but it was suppressed quickly, for, doubtless, anxious cars were awaiting the sounds to learn where we were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> then fired heavily for an hour of <num value="2">two</num> on our extreme left and far off on our right, without discovering any valuable information. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/> A heavy thunder storm came on at <time value="4oclock">four o'clock</time>, and raged violently over the valley and mountain, checking, to a great extent, the firing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>About sunset it was renewed, and during an hour, up to dark, the explosions continued rapidly and heavy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>Some hours before night, it became evident that the enemy were becoming more bold and threatening, and that if the weather permitted, a heavy engagement must ensue on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>Therefore our supply train was ordered to the rear, and everything cleared for the threatened battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>Our army, notwithstanding the drenching rain and terrible storms of the past few days, were defiant and ready at any moment to enter the battle with the indomitable spirit that has actuated them heretofore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>They believe in their unconquerable courage and invincible prowess, hence they care nothing for the disparity of numbers with which they are threatened, but await with unabated confidence the result. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>But with the persistent again of inveterate enemies, they began skirmishing at dawn and continued during the entire day, without any material change or many casualties occurring in the lines. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/> The hostile armies confront each other very closely, and we are of the opinion that we have taken our stand to give the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> battle, if they will attack us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>They cannot effectively flank on our right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>We think they will make on effort to cast a strong force on our centre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>We await the sunshine and a few hours of dry weather very anxiously.

<head>A Sensible conclusion.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/> The <orgName n="New York Times" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> has at last found out that even if <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> were taken, it would not end the war. This amazing discovery is the result of <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> study and observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>The rebellion is no longer to be &#x0022;speedily crushed.&#x0022; &#x0022;It is only this year,&#x0022; quoth the <hi rend="italics">Times,</hi> &#x0022;that a very considerable portion of the public has thoroughly wakened up to the fact that, owing to the enormous extent of the territory we seek to conquer, the occupation of places is of comparatively little value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>Of course, some places, such as the <rs>Capital</rs> of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, have more value than others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>The loss of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> would be a heavy blow and a great discouragement to the enemy; but it would be simply a moral blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>It would be a mortification, but unless it was an indication of weakness, it would be nothing more.&#x0022; The <hi rend="italics">Times</hi>then concedes that our people have suffered too much to be appalled by &#x0022;moral blows,&#x0022; and that if <persName n="Richmond,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00258" reg="mostcommon:Richmond,Robt,Lumpdon,,:1"><surname>Richmond</surname></persName> were taken, and <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00259" reg="nearbymention:Lee,David,M.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> allowed to retire Southward without much damage, &#x0022;there is no question whatever we should not have made much progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>He would hold out in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, or <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, conscript and impress supplies, and fight on as before, and we should have to follow him for hundreds of miles, slowly, continuously, and with difficulties of all kinds steadily increasing the further we penetrated into the interior and away from our base.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/> This is a sage conclusion, though whether it is announced in consequence of an apprehension that <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> cannot be taken, and that something must be said to console the <rs>Northern</rs> <rs n="Fox" type="nativeamerican">fox</rs> for the loss of the grapes, we cannot pretend to guess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>But whatever the motive of the announcement, it is none the less true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>It is, therefore, of the last importance to <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00268" reg="nearbymention:Grant,H.,D.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> that he should capture <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00269" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Gen,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, and we may calculate with confidence that nothing less than this has been and is his design, and that no effort or stratagem will be left untried for that purpose. </p>
