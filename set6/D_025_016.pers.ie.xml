<head>The news from New York.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> We have some intelligence from the <rs>North</rs> this morning for more welcome, and much more important, than foreign intervention.--The peace meeting in New York, so bitterly ridiculed by the unthinking &mdash; those safe parallels by which the anti-war people of the <rs>North</rs> were working into open resistance to Lincoln Government &mdash; have borne their fruit. --The white flag has been suddenly lowered, and the red battle flag now waves in New York over streets wet with the gore of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s hate <unclear></unclear> minions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>This grand movement in New York is but the precursor of a series of similar outbreaks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Already have riots followed in <placeName reg="Hartford, Hartford, Connecticut" key="tgn,7013695">Hartford, Ct.</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Newark, Essex, New Jersey" key="tgn,7014218">Newark, N. J.</placeName>, and in a few days we shall hear from the <rs>West</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>These demonstrations may, and doubtless will, be put down by the iron hand of the military, but there will be no enforcement of the draft after quite is restored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>These people have elected to die in the streets rather than submit to the hateful tyranny of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, and have proved themselves in earnest by pouring out their blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>They have shown a spirit which <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, too glad to see subside, will never again rouse Already he is cowering before it, and telegraphs to <persName n="Seymour,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Seymour,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Seymour</surname></persName> that the draft will be suspended in New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>When he shall have had time to fill the city with troops this promise may not be respected, but he cannot fill all, or even <num value="6">a half dozen</num>, of the large cities at the <rs>North</rs> with sufficient force to enforce the conscription.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>He has not the men to spare and we may very safely conclude that the days as well as the soldiers of the <rs>Federal</rs> army are numbered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>There will be no addition to its strength, and it is confessed on all hands that the present <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> force under arms can never begin to subdue the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Let us have more of these outpourings &mdash; a few more great cities on mourners bench &mdash; some more gutting and staking of houses, and hanging and mutilating of men. It saves the <rs>Confederate</rs> troops a deal of marching and fighting, and lops off many a dreary month of this war. The sacking and burning has been heretofore at the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Our compliments to our Northern &#x0022;brethren,&#x0022; and may they enjoy their turn. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s Retrograde movement.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> Opinions are various with regard to the motives which induced <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> to withdraw his army to the <rs>Virginia</rs> side of the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>All seem, however, to agree that the movement was proper, under the circumstances, whatever they might be, being guided in their opinions entirely by the profound confidence which they repose in the <rs>Commander</rs>'s professional skill, and his well known prudence and discretion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>We shall not hazard a conjecture on the subject, although the long continued flood in the <rs>Potomac</rs>, and the absolute necessity of preserving his communication with <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, furnish ample reasons for the movement, without attributing it to a defeat. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> There are persons who think, and have thought from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, that the invasion of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> was a rash and dangerous experiment, which there was no justification for having undertaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>We are not <num value="1">one</num> of these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>On the contrary, we believe, when the secret history of this war shall have been published, the conduct of the <rs>General</rs> will be amply justified by circumstances of which we are now, and must for a generation remain, completely ignorance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>As for the effect of the invasion, that is a question open, even now, to discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Various are the opinions upon the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/><num value="1">One</num> party maintains with great warmth that it has been altogether, and without mitigation, injurious to our cause, another that it has neither advanced nor retarded its progress, <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> that it has been productive only of benefit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>We agree with neither of these parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>We conceive that, like most other events in this world, it has been productive both of good and evil, though we are disposed to think that the <hi rend="italics">good</hi> more than balances the evil. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> That it has had the immediate effect of stimulating the war passions of the <rs>North</rs>, and enabling <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> with the more ease to recruit his shattered ranks, can hardly be denied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>But it must be recollected that this was the consequence not of the expedition itself, but of the withdrawal of the troops, and has not therefore the slightest bearing upon the wisdom of the measure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Had <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> destroyed the <orgName>army of <persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="nearbymention:Meade,G.,G.,,"><surname>Meade</surname></persName></orgName>, as there was every reason to hope we should then have seen how fatal was the blow he had struck.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The wisdom of a measure is not always to be judged by its success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>We must look to the design, and see what would have been the consequences had it succeeded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>In this case we may judge what they would have been, by the abject terror with which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were struck when they found their country invaded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Had <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> destroyed the <orgName>army of <persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="nearbymention:Meade,G.,G.,,"><surname>Meade</surname></persName></orgName> &mdash; and this was what he aimed and expected to do &mdash; he would have held in his hands the issues of war and peace. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> He failed to accomplish his object, but failure in the execution implies no want of judgment in the conception, unless the means should be ridiculously small.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>They were not so in this case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> believed them to be ample. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> But this expedition has been of service in these respects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>It relieved an impoverished country from the burthen of supporting a large army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>It gave us enormous supplies to be need hereafter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>It enabled us to live on the enemy, and to make war &mdash; for a time at least &mdash; support war. Above all, it has taught the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> that they, as well as we, are open to invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>In the exultation of the moment they may forget this; but when that exultation has subsided, they will be sure to remember it. The dread of seeing repeated on their own territory the scenes which their plunderers have enacted on ours, will operate more powerfully in disposing their minds to peace than any number of battles lost within the boundaries of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>From an interesting editorial in that paper on the &#x0022;situation&#x0022; we make the following extracts: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/> We mean not either to censure our military authorities or to dictate or embarrass their movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>On the contrary, our honest and earnest desire and purpose are to encourage, stimulate, strengthen and sustain them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>With all proper deference and respect, then, we say to them that our people are fully up to the exigency of the times, and stand ready, at any and every hazard and cost, to <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> them in a brave and determined effort to drive the enemy back into the ocean from their strongholds on <placeName reg="Morris Island, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2525074">Morris's</placeName> and <placeName reg="Folly Island, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,2333489">Folly Islands</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>If the safety of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> be involved in such a movement, there should be no hesitation in making the attempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Let us do all that may become men whose liberties and lives, whose homes and altars, and all that is dear to them, as fathers, brothers, and husbands, are staked on the momentous issue. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>The fall of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> involves consequences which we shudder to contemplate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>With her capture the whole State would soon be at the mercy of the foe, and the great cause of Southern independence would be put, in fearful jeopardy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Nothing but a guerilla warfare for the <rs>Southern</rs> and Southwestern portion of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, if not for its whole extent, would then be left us, in manifestation of our undying and unconquerable determination never to submit to <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>Let us, then, resolve to defend our beloved and time honored city to the last extremity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> let us make every possible human effort to wrest the adjacent islands from the enemy, and enable <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName> and our other harbor fortresses, with our steam rams, to keep the vandals at bay. Failing in this, and even should <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName> become untenable, then let us resolve on a Saragossa defence of our city, manning and defending every wharf &mdash; fighting from street to street and house to house &mdash; and, if failing to achieve success, yielding nothing but smoking ruins and mangled bodies as the spoil of the ruthless conqueror.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>Should <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> fall, life will be no longer worth living; let us then freely peril life in her defence, and resolutely devote her to destruction sooner than yield her undemolished, as a trophy and flourishing sea port, to the accursed foe. We once advocated a different policy &mdash; we were once for capitulation, in preference to self-sought or self-inflicted desolation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>But we then mistakenly thought we had to encounter an enemy bound by the rules of civilized warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>The mask is now thrown aside; New Orleans, <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName> have taught us what we have to expect from the tender mercies of our unprincipled foe, and we know that our subjugation involves submission to a vile and atrocious despotism, to worse than savage barbarities, to degradation and insult, (sparing neither age, sex, nor condition,) and to the galling infamy of servile domination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>Let us, then, bid destruction and extermination welcome, sooner than succumb to <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> dominion and all its nameless enormities; and, if <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> must fall, let her, although in ruin, yet live as the most glorious monument of self defence ever recorded in history, covering her defenders with immortal glory and her vandal conquerors with undying infamy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/> We are among those who cherish the confident <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> hope that the enemy will be miserably unsuccessful in executing the plans he is at present working so vigorously and resolutely to carry out. We expect him to be punished severely if he persists in the undertaking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>But we may be disappointed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>Our hope may prove a delusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>The result the timid and despondent predict may transpire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>The capture of our city may perchance delight his base and corrupt heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>In case that frightful calamity fall upon us, they who remain here must suffer grievous evils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>The woes they will have poured out upon them will be far heavier than those under which the citizens of New Orleans and <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName> have groaned; for the vile foe hates the people of this State with a tenfold more bitter hatred than he entertains for the inhabitants of any other section, and he will not spare us when he comes as conqueror. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/> On the supposition of the foe's success, it is our duty to avoid incurring his fiendish malignity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>All who can be of no service in the work of defence should betake themselves to places of shelter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>And it were well not to defer removal to a late day. We may be compelled to remain, or, if we make good our escape, circumstances may oblige us to leave all our personal effects behind. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/> We should also consider that our city is going to make a fierce and determined resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>If the enemy gets it he will have to take it. No flag of truce boat will meet him mid way between the wharves and <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> in order to effect a surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>We are going to fight till we are driven from street to street, and continue to fight while we are retreating. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/> So determined a resistance involves immense injury to our fair city, at the hands of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>It will be little better than a heap of ruins, even though the work of destruction is not insured by military order. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/> We repeat that we are of opinion that the present attack will result as the other attacks have done, and even more disastrously to the mean and wicked foe. But is it not proper to prepare for the worst?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>If we are forced to defend our city after the manner we have resolved to defend it, the women and children and aged men who tarry too long would suffer <sic>misiries</sic> infinitely greater than they will have to hear during their temporary exile. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/> It behooves us to give this subject serious and profound consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>If the enemy is forced to abandon the effort he is making to gain possession of our city, we can return to our homes in a short time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>If he is successful &mdash; which <name n="God" type="God">God</name> forbid!--we will have avoided privations and woes of which we can now form no adequate conception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>Let us take counsel of prudence. </p>
