<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> An officer from the <placeName reg="Rappahannock, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1129010">Rappahannock river</placeName> gives us some highly important intelligence from our operations in that vicinity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The positions and movements of our army need not be mentioned; but we can state that the enemy is in full retreat and closely pursued by our troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> heavy and continued cannonading was heard at <placeName reg="Orange, Virginia" key="tgn,7014299">Orange Court House</placeName> up to the time that the train left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>At <placeName key="tgn,2114382" n="1.000 36" reg="stevensburg, culpeper, virginia">Stevensburg</placeName> about <time value="10am">10 o'clock A. M.</time>, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct>, a party of our cavalry encountered a large body of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> cavalry and a brisk skirmish ensued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The enemy retired slowly and in good or for, and were perused to within <placeName><distance reg="2miles">two miles</distance> of the <rs>Rappahannock</rs></placeName>, when a charge was made with great gallantry by the <rs>Confederate</rs> horse and <num value="60">sixty</num> odd of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were taken prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>On Thursday a portion of our troops were engaged with the enemy at <placeName reg="Kellys Mill, Okaloosa, Florida" key="tgn,2434002">Kelly's mill</placeName> and another portion at of near <placeName reg="Beverley's Ford">Beverley's Ford</placeName>, the artillery on either side contending for some hours late in the after soon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>without, however, any material result as far as known. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> It was supposed that <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Pope,John,,,:1"><surname>Pope</surname></persName> had fallen back as far as <placeName reg="Warrenton, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2114921">Warrenton</placeName>, and would not give battle this side of that point, if at all. He abandoned a large number of his wounded at <placeName reg="Culpeper Court House">Culpeper C. H.</placeName>, estimated at not less than <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="300">three hundred</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>These men had been wounded in the <rs n="Battle of Cedar Run" type="battle">battle of Cedar Run</rs> Mountain, of the <date value="08-09">9th of August,</date> where the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisoners confess to having been thoroughly <q>&#x0022;used up&#x0022;</q> by old <persName><foreName>Stonewall</foreName></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> A melancholy picture of desolation and devastation is exhibited by the county of <placeName reg="Culpeper, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002155">Culpeper</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>An unbridled license has prevailed among the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> soldiery, and the country is now almost a desert.--Unoffending citizens have been impoverished in a single day, their negroes all carried off, their fencing destroyed, their sheep and hogs and cattle butchered, their grain entirely consumed, their horses all stolen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>A farmer, whose house <persName n="Milroy,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Milroy,nomatch:0"><surname>Milroy</surname></persName> made his headquarters, had a magnificent field of corn, from which he expected to realize <measure n="1000barrels" type="mass">1,000 barrels</measure>. The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> General refused in insolent language, to spare his crop, and gave his hirelings a <hi rend="italics">carts blanche</hi> to plunder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The result is that not <num value="5">five</num> bushels can be made from the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>In some in stances colts only a year old were forcibly carried off despite the entreaties of their owners, and old hens with flocks of chickens have been killed.--Many a family has been left in a condition verging upon absolute want and starvation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> Our informant says that the scene of joyous delight manifested by the inhabitants at their deliverance surpassed anything he ever witnessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Ladies brought pails of water on their heads to distribute among the worn and dust-covered heroes of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Old men wept for joy. The girls waved their handkerchiefs and cheered the army from early morning till late in the afternoon, and all praised <name n="God" type="God">God</name> for their deliverance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>From passengers who came through from <placeName reg="Orange, Virginia" key="tgn,7014299">Orange Court house</placeName> on the <rs>Central</rs> train last night we learn that a severe engagement took place at the <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Rappahannock river</placeName>, a few miles below the railroad bridge, on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, commending about sunrise and continuing some <measure n="4hours" type="date">four hours</measure>. The enemy attempted to dispute the passage of our troops across the river, and a <orgName n="Heavy Artillery" type="artillery">heavy artillery</orgName> fight resulted, in which we lost about <num value="150">one-hundred and fifty</num> in killed and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The loss of the enemy was believed to be much greater.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The troops engaged on the part of the enemy were the <orgName n="Army Corps" type="corps">army corps</orgName> of <persName n="Burnside,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Burnside</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The enemy were finally driven back and our forces crossed the river, capturing about <measure n="400" type="prisoners">four hundred prisoners</measure>. A report was also brought by passengers that our cavalry had advanced as far North as <orgName n="Bristow Station" type="station">Bristow Station</orgName>, on the <orgName n="Orange and Alexandria Railroad" type="railroad">Orange and Alexandria Railroad</orgName>, within <placeName><distance reg="7miles">seven miles</distance> of <placeName reg="Manassas, Manassas, Virginia" key="tgn,2112877">Manassas Junction</placeName></placeName>, and that our troops had occupied the town of <placeName reg="Warrenton, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2114921">Warrenton</placeName>, but these reports seem not to be well authenticated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>It was further stated that our troops were pursuing Burn-side in the direction of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, and that the main body of the latter's army had reached that town, as early as <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>. Those familiar with the distance between the <num value="2">two</num> points will at once detect the improbability of this statement. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> To sum up the information as received by us, we accept the conclusion that the <rs>Federal</rs> forces have retreated in the direction of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>; that the fight of Saturday at <placeName reg="Rappahannock, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1129010">Rappahannock river</placeName> was an effort to cover that retreat; that they were defeated with the loss of prisoners stated, and that our army, having crossed the river, is pursuing them northward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Any speculation as to when the foe will be overtaken, or where the next fight will occur, would be uselessly consuming space in our columns. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> From gentlemen who arrived in this city yesterday from the lower end of <persName n="King,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:King,nomatch:0"><surname>King</surname></persName> and <placeName reg="Queen county">Queen county</placeName>, we learn that a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> force of some <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> thou and landed at <placeName reg="Gloucester Point, Gloucester, Virginia" key="tgn,2111953">Gloucester Point</placeName> on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, and took up the line of march in the direction of <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>This force consisted of infantry, cavalry, and a battery of artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The sudden and unexpected appearance of a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> force in that locality, suggests an inquiry as to the whereabouts of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> and the remnant of his army who left <placeName reg="Westover, Charles City, Virginia" key="tgn,2114993">Westover</placeName> in the early part of last week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>It is pretty certain that his army has never reached <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>A gentlemen, who lives on the <placeName reg="Rappahannock, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1129010">Rappahannock river</placeName>, and who left his home on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time>, assures us that so troops had passed up the river since Burn-side's corps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>It is, therefore, not at all improbable that the force landed at <placeName reg="Gloucester Point, Gloucester, Virginia" key="tgn,2111953">Gloucester Point</placeName> on Saturday is but the advance guard of the army that recently evacuated the banks of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>. </p> </div3>
