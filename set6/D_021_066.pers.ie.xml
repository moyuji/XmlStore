<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/> The news from <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> and the <rs>West</rs> has quite diverted our attention from the enemy hereabouts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>We have little worth recording, if we except some further attempts of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> to penetrate towards our outposts, with a view to reconnoitre doubtless.--The last attempt has resulted rather unfavorably for them, thought they returned the fire of our pickets without inflicting any injury whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>The late desultory movements in our neighborhood indicate an impatience on the part of the invaders which will cause us, no doubt, considerable trouble from predatory incursions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/> Their fleet has dispersed along the coasts of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, and now are in the <placeName reg="Saint Johns, Florida, United States" key="tgn,1129377">St. Johns river</placeName>, and doubtless in possession of <placeName reg="Jacksonville, Duval, Florida" key="tgn,7013804">Jacksonville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>In my last letter I expressed the fear that they would ascend the river and succeed in destroying the foundry located there, and the <name n="Confederate States">Confederate</name> gunboat being built by <persName n="Mooney,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00103" reg="mostcommon:Mooney,nomatch:0"><surname>Mooney</surname></persName> under contract with the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>It has been reported here by passengers over the road from <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName> that the town of <placeName reg="Jacksonville, Duval, Florida" key="tgn,7013804">Jacksonville</placeName> has been the scene of intense agitation on account of the near approach of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>Besides destroying the foundry and gunboat already alluded to, the citizens appear to have dealt summarily with some <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> doing business there who attempted to make their way to the enemy; the punishment, though sudden, is not undeserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>There are some dwellers along our coast. --though, thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name>; they are not numerous &mdash; who set astride the fence, openly swearing by the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and yet ready at any moment to give aid and comfort to the cause which they secretly wish success to, but dare not assist from the pusillanimous fear of bodily injury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>That these men exist everywhere is admitted, and <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> is no exception to the general rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>We are well satisfied that the enemy possess information which they could not have obtained by any other means than secret communication; their sudden advent at <placeName key="tgn,2019279" n="1.000 62" reg="fernandina, nassau, florida">Fernandina</placeName> while the guns were all dismounted and the town in an unprepared state to resist, could not have been the result of any chance visit, but followed from secret information given the enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/> It has been already declared in the papers that a fisherman was the medium of communication; and that these means exist everywhere, even in our midst, cannot well be doubted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>The lesson which the people of <placeName reg="Jacksonville, Duval, Florida" key="tgn,7013804">Jacksonville</placeName> had learned, and which they carried into effect, will keep the emissaries of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00104" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> in wholesome terror of a like visitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>I have learned that <num value="3000">three thousand</num> of the enemy now hold the town, and no doubt will harass the few remaining citizens as long as they are permitted to stay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>They are on the main at present, and <persName n="Trapier,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00105" reg="mostcommon:Trapier,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Trapier</surname></persName> has an opportunity to redeem his honor and teach the foe a useful lesson.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>He has called upon the <rs>Governor</rs> for <num value="2500">twenty-five hundred</num> men, and, with the force he has at present available, will be able to cope with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>They have not progressed as far as <placeName reg="Jacksonville, Duval, Florida" key="tgn,7013804">Jacksonville</placeName> without encountering serious opposition and loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>No batteries were there to detain them; but the brave riflemen, who are accustomed to the chase in the woods and everglades of the flowery State, did not permit them to pass unassailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>Many fell upon the deck, until the prudent regard for their safety compelled the remainder to take refuge in the hold. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/> The <placeName reg="Jacksonville, Duval, Florida" key="tgn,7013804">Jacksonville</placeName> people got rid of their <rs type="role2">Mayor</rs> before leaving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>He counselled submission at once to the enemy in order to save the town, but it did not meet the concurrence of his liege subjects and they sent him adrift. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/> The Mayoralty is an important office at this time, and the incumbents seem to acquire new dignity to wear the robes of office and handle the rod of power with a more complacent air, just at the moment when inexorable fate is about to end their reign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>Unlike great monarchs, they strut about with pompous importance just as they have been made <q>&#x0022;poor indeed&#x0022; </q> by being stript of their magisterial honors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>The worthy <rs>Major</rs> of <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName> has declared his intention to hang to the lamp-post any <num value="1">one</num> caught setting fire to his own or his neighbor's dwelling, in the event of the surrender of the city to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> Our <rs type="role" reg="Mayor">Mayor</rs> of <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> is <num value="1">one</num> of the right stamp; though I have not learnt that he designed any such extension of his prerogative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>I have understood that the expressed his determination to fight the fire which <persName n="Walker,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00106" reg="nearbymention:Walker,Jonathan,Stewart,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Walker</surname></persName> had said he would apply to the city in a similar emergency &mdash; to fight it with water. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/> The question has been discussed seriously here to fire the city in preference to leaving it an asylum to the legions of blood thirsty vagabonds that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00107" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> has sent to subdue us. Many have entered seriously into the question but none, I venture to predict, that have aught to lose in the general destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>If any advantage could accrue to us by the destruction, or positive injury to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>, it would be well to make the sacrifice, and not <num value="1">one</num> of the native citizens of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> but would make it willingly &mdash; nay, bring other goods to feed the flame; but there is no shadow or benefit to arise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>It will not prevent the enemy from holding the position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>They surely can get but little supplies towards the support of their army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>All the means of manufacturing and preparing ordnance or warlike material should be effectually destroyed beforehand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>What advantage, then could result from the destruction of the city?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>None whatever, and the citizens of <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> will be the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to defend their homes from wanton, ruthless destruction, from whatsoever source it may come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>This has been ascribed to <persName n="Walker,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00108" reg="nearbymention:Walker,Jonathan,Stewart,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Walker</surname></persName> frequently, but I am not aware that the <rs>General</rs> ever expressed any such opinion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/> The discussion in Congress relative to the removal of <persName n="Johnson,,Sidney,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00109" reg="default:Johnson,Sidney,,,"><foreName>Sidney</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName> from the command in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, does not find favor here, thought the <rs>President</rs> may succumb to the violence of the opposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>It has been suggested that the <rs>President</rs> could relieve <persName n="Johnson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00110" reg="nearbymention:Johnson,Sidney,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName> from the cloud of sand-flies that now annoy him; he could save his friend; he could make many new supporters of his Administration; he could take advantage of the present ardor of the <rs>South</rs>, and change the whole aspect in the <rs>West</rs> by taking the field in person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>I believe such a movement would be of incalculable service to the country, and around his banner <num value="1000">thousands</num> would flock who have not yet been called to the field. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/> Nothing of any especial importance has occurred on our river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>Yesterday <persName n="Tatnall,Commodore,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00111" reg="mostcommon:Tatnall,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commodore">Commodore</roleName> <surname>Tatnall</surname></persName> went down in the <rs>Savannah</rs>, and, I understand, <persName n="Lawton,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00112" reg="mostcommon:Lawton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lawton</surname></persName>, also, to reconnoitre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>They were saluted with about <num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num> shot &mdash; in fact, during the entire morning the booming of great guns were heard from all parts of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>The enemy have now very formidable works on the river; not only by reason of the number of their guns, but of their range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/><num value="17">Seventeen</num> guns have been mounted in batteries, and the passage of the river is an impossibility for any other than an iron clad battery. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/> The success of the <rs>Merrimack</rs>, or rather <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, (a better hame than that stream from which so much of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> flows into the ocean of Northern life,) has set all the people astir; but time will be required to effect anything of value. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/> Since my last communication to your interesting and valuable paper, we have had quite stirring times in this section, which I will endeavor to give to your readers so far as known. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/> Since about the <dateStruct value="-03-1"><day reg="1">first</day> of <month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>, that noble and gallant band, <orgName n="cavalry"><persName n="Ashby,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00126" reg="mostcommon:Ashby,nomatch:0"><surname>Ashby</surname></persName>'s cavalry</orgName>, have been constantly skirmishing with the enemy, until <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> last, when they advanced in such force so close to our lines, that the cavalry pickets and scouts were compelled to retire before them; not, however, until the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had to use cannon to drive them in. <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time> and night our small forces was in position, anticipating that the main body would attach us and endeavor to gain possession of <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>; but they felled to do so and fell back some distance from the advance they had succeeded in gaining in the morning. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>For, if it exists at all, it is without limit, and by requiring every man over <measure n="18years" type="date">eighteen years</measure> of age to enter the service, it would restrict the range of selection for Confederate offices to persons under that age.--Such a result is absurd. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>But the law in terms exempts all Executive officers of the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/> <hi rend="italics">Whereas,</hi> by reason of the want of conformity in the <rs>State</rs> and Confederate legislation, or a want of concert in executing the same, <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> is likely to have in the field a larger force than her due proportion, that the <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName> do not deem it advisable to counteract by any additional legislation at this advanced stage of the session, now near its constitutional close, and in the present aspect of the war; and whereas, it is not supposable that any State of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> expects or is willing that any other State shall make an unequal contribution of men or means to the general defence; therefore, be it. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/> <rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>--I propose this joint resolution from the highest and purest sense of public duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>I shall forbear on this occasion to fully discuss the whole subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>That our laws relating to military affairs are not as plain as they should be, the <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName> has itself put forth the most significant commentary, by raising a joint committee to explain them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>It is only to <num value="1">one</num> of these laws that the resolution I have offered refers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>I desire to handle that product of military genius and legislative skill with all possible tenderness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>I must refer to <num value="2">two</num> of its objects only &mdash; the <num value="1">one</num> troubles its execution by the <rs>State</rs> authorities, the other leaves the <rs>State</rs> without security to get a credit for those of her citizens who engage, at once, directly, in the <rs>Confederate</rs> service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> defect is where the act directs that <q>&#x0022;at least <measure n="30days" type="date">thirty days</measure>&#x0022;</q> before the expiration of the current term, the company shall be mustered to ascertain how many and which will re-enlist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>There are vagueness of idea and looseness of language in this provision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>It falls to fix the time at which the ascertainment shall be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/>It <hi rend="italics">must</hi> be <measure n="30days" type="date">thirty days</measure> before the expiration of the current term, but it <hi rend="italics">may</hi> be, as well, <measure n="60days" type="date">sixty days</measure> or <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure>, antecedently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>If the law had declared that within the <num value="10">ten</num> or <measure n="20days" type="date">twenty days</measure> next before the last <measure n="30days" type="date">thirty days</measure> of the term, the facts should be ascertained, as was otherwise and indeterminately directed as to the time, the <rs>Executive</rs> would not have been left, by the act of any subordinate or himself, to select the time, and so to complicate the execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>The call made by the rolls sent to the camps by the <rs type="role" reg="Adjutant General">Adjutant General</rs> of the <rs>State</rs>, for the number re- enlisted and of those not re-enlisted, ought not to have delayed, but was calculated, as it was meant, by ascertaining their strength, to facilitate the filling up of the companies to the complement of <num value="100">100</num> men each. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/> The other defect, and the <num value="1">one</num> of most importance in our Confederate relations, is, as already intimated, that the <rs>State</rs> is not secured any credit, either expressly or constructively, for the volunteers who might engage, and were strongly tempted to engage, outright in the <rs>Confederate</rs> service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/>The act of <date value="1862-02-10">February 10, 1862,</date> only secures a credit to the counties, cities, and towns, as against <num value="1">one</num> another; but it falls to secure the credit for the <rs>State</rs> as against the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>; and this is so, although it was known that the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> was inviting volunteer companies, whilst the <rs>Governor</rs> was denied the authority to accept new organizations. </p> </q><bibl n="Mr. Collier"></bibl></cit> </div5> </div4>
