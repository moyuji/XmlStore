<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> Congress, it is believed, will adjourn on to-morrow &mdash; if not, certainly on some day of next week, to convene, when required by the public interests, in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Heretofore, the supervision of all matters connected with patents has been confided to the <orgName n="Justice Department" type="department">Department of Justice</orgName>, presided over by the able and amiable <persName n="Benjamin,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Benjamin,nomatch:0"><surname>Benjamin</surname></persName>, but the great number of application, although confined under the law to citizens of this Confederacy, has shown to Congress the necessity for the prompt organization of a <orgName n="Patents Bureau" type="bureau">Bureau of Patents</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>And on yesterday, in public session, <persName n="Brooke,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Brooke,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Brooke</surname></persName>, chairman of the committee on the subject, reported a bill to establish a <orgName n="Patent Office" type="office">Patent Office</orgName>, and to provide for the <q>&#x0022;granting and Issuance of patents for new and useful discoveries, improvements and designs&#x0022;</q> The bill contains a great number of sections, occupying <num value="38">38</num> or <num value="39">39</num> pages of Government foolscap printing.--A number of its features are very similar in all respects to the <orgName n="Patent Office" type="office">Patent Office</orgName> law of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Several sections of it met with opposition, and the <num value="1">one</num> making an appropriation to be expended in the collection of agricultural statistics and for agricultural purposes, was very properly stricken out, else we should soon have had a collection and distribution of the same worthless seeds, roots, and <orgName n="Patent Office" type="office">Patent Office</orgName> reports with which this Department of the <q>&#x0022;old wreck,&#x0022;</q> at an enormous cost, flooded the country; although none of the former, with the exception of the common turnip seed, ever grew, whilst the latter rare works, in consideration of their wisdom, delight and use, have been most generally honored with a companionship among the rats and spiders that infest dark, obscure closets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Before the reading of the bill was flushed, Congress went into secret session. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> <placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> in the meantime transmitted some additional estimates of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The recent expenditures of this department have been very large, amounting within the last few days to nearly <num value="2000000">two millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Some dissatisfaction has also been expressed with its manner of conducting business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Charges of delay in issuing committees to applicants, and complaints of <unclear>neg</unclear> Inefficiency, have been preferred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>I have also heard the <rs>Secretary</rs> blamed for the serious indiscretion he committed in declaring, about the time of the attack on <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>, that in <measure n="60days" type="date">60 days</measure> the <rs>Confederate</rs> flag would be floating proudly from the dome of the <rs>Capitol</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> &mdash; bravado calculated to produce great excitement and hostility at the <rs>North</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> The <rs type="role" reg="Postmaster General">Postmaster General</rs> has wisely determined to retain in his service all the <rs type="role" reg="Route-Agent">Route Agents</rs>, Postmasters and other officials connected with the mails, until a complete organization of the new service is effected and all its parts made perfect; after which, the removals, if any, will be few, and only made in obedience to public interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The differences between the postal laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and those of this Government are small, consisting chiefly in an increase of the rates of postage and repeal of the letter registration system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The franking privilege has also been abolished, with exceptions in favor of the <rs type="role" reg="Postmaster General">Postmaster General</rs>, his chief clerk, heads of Bureaus in his department, and deputy postmasters, who are allowed to frank on official business. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> The increase in the rates of postage has been adopted in order to make the department self-sustain, instead of a tax of <num value="1000000">millions</num> upon the country, like its predecessor at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> A design for postage stamps, about which there has been some anxiety, has been selected, and a contract partially made for a supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The new stamp will be quite pretty &mdash; a tittle larger than the old, with an elegant steel engraving of <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> in the centre, and will be furnished the country early in <dateStruct value="-06-"><month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> The self-sacrificing <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs>, like another <persName n="Cerberus,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Cerberus,nomatch:0"><surname>Cerberus</surname></persName>, is guarding the <rs n="money bags" type="product">money bags</rs>, which, to save from still less depiction, he has determined to prohibit the creation of assistant offices to those of <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> Auditor and Comptroller. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> In the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States Government</orgName> there are <num value="6">six</num> Auditors and <num value="2">two</num> Comptrollers, <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num> and <num value="2" type="ordinal">2d</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Here there will be but <num value="1">one</num> of each, and only <num value="1">one</num> set of books to be kept by the <name>Registers</name> for the entire department, so as to prevent an increase of clerical force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>This is the system recommended by <persName n="Hamilton,,Alexander,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="default:Hamilton,Alexander,,,"><foreName>Alexander</foreName> <surname>Hamilton</surname></persName>, and adopted by the <rs>Government</rs> in <dateStruct value="1728--"><year reg="1728">1728</year></dateStruct>, by the appointment of only <num value="1">one</num> Auditor; but subsequently changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>As a precedent, however, of the early and purer days of our once mighty Republic, it has received the reverence and sedition of the conscientious <rs>Secretary</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> Those <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">Lady Davis</rs>, purchased by the <orgName n="Navy Department" type="department">Navy Department</orgName> from the <rs>Governor</rs> of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, was to-day paid for by the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>She cost <measure n="32000dollars" type="currency">$32,000</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> The people here are amazed and mortified at the course of the recent traitors in a portion of <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961"><rs type="direction">North</rs> western Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>It is sincerely hoped that the toad spotted wretch, <persName n="Carlile,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="nearbymention:Carlile,John,S.,,"><surname>Carlile</surname></persName>, the leader in the conspiracy, will be held swiftly accountable for the cowardly treason he is committing against the sovereign Commonwealth of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>We know that they pant for an opportunity to demonstrate their love and gratitude to this great, generous and noble Commonwealth, and are eager to exercise the proud prerogatives of a freeman, whish she has conferred upon them in such a way as to insure her the freedom which she is struggling to maintain against despotic oppressors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>They recognize the fact that their supreme allegiance, like that of native-born citizens of the <rs>State</rs>, is due to <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and not to the <rs>Chicago</rs> platform, which has been substituted by the <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00112" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,President,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName></hi> party for the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>It is possible, however, that some of their number do not realize the importance of voting, taking it for granted that as they see no opposition to the <name>Ordinance</name> of Secession, it will pass without their assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>But if all voters should reason in this way, that Ordinance might be defeated, because, in the <rs>Northwest</rs> and on the borders of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> and the <placeName key="tgn,7014265" n="1.000 75" reg="ohio river, united states, north and central america">Ohio river</placeName>, large numbers of illegal voters will probably be introduced, who will manage, through the aid of a few crafty and unscrupulous traitors in that section of the <rs>State</rs>, to misrepresent, and perhaps to stifle the popular voice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>Indeed, an influential paper in New York, formerly the organ of the <orgName n="Know Nothing party" type="party">Know-Nothing party</orgName>, has threatened that we shall be invaded on that day, and holds up to us the infamous menace of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Wilson,,Billy,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00113" reg="default:Wilson,Billy,,,"><foreName>Billy</foreName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName></hi> and his gang voting at <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> ballot-boxes upon the <rs>Virginia Ordinance</rs> of Secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>Moreover, it is all important that the vote shall be a full <num value="1">one</num>, so as to express, beyond all mistake, the real sentiments of the <rs>Virginia</rs> people, and prevent our opponents from pointing to a thin vote, as an evidence that the people were opposed to secession and staid away from the polls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>For it cannot be denied that they will consider <hi rend="italics">every vote which is not given for Secession as given for the <rs>Union</rs>,</hi> and that every man who does not vote against the old Union will be looked upon to be as much for that Union as the man who actually votes for it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/> The <rs>Monticello</rs>, after a little while, careened over to <num value="1">one</num> side, which was caused, it is thought, by the removal of the guns, or some other weight, to <num value="1">one</num> side, in order to prevent her from sinking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>I am sorry that so noble a fellow should be placed by his superiors in a position which exposes him to unkind feeling on the part of so many of his regiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/> The <rs>Monticello</rs> received several shots from the battery, which caused her rapid retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>It is supposed that the cause of this attack on the part of the steamer was to prevent the erection of a battery.
