<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/> --The military strength of a people, or of an army, depends on a combination of sundry essential requisites.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>There must be sufficient number to constitute armies &mdash; hardihood and courage and obedience to command of the individual who become soldiers &mdash; and enough of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>munitions of war, supplies of provisions and money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>All these requisites, in their full measure, are of great importance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>The most short-sighted reasoner would pronounce that there would be scarcely a possibility for successful warfare if either <num value="1">one</num> of these elements of military strength were entirely wanting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>Still necessary as are all of these and other mean-for military success, in some measure, there may be great deficiency in <num value="1">one</num>, or even more than <num value="1">one</num>, compensated by abundance in others Thus, the courage and devoted patriotism of an army, and its well-placed confidence in, and obedience to, the leaders, have, in many cases, served for the triumphant and glorious defence of a country, though with defective arms and supplies, and contending against far more numerous and well supplied enemies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/> But there is <num value="1">one</num> other requisite for military success which cannot be dispensed with, which must be possessed in no stinted measure, and which, if greatly deficient, must produce and ensure disaster or defeat, even if armies are every so numerous, brave, and well supplied with all physical means for warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>This all important and essential requisite, for every particular corps, whether a regiment, a brigade, a division, or an entire, army, is <hi rend="italics">military capacity of the commander</hi> for discharging the duties required, and his <hi rend="italics">ability</hi> for military command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>Without these, no success in military operations can be expected, or scarcely will be possible, unless by accident, or by the military preparations and field operations being really directed by some obscure but better qualified adviser and guide to the authorized commander and ostensible leader and director of the operations in question. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/> It is true that there have been excellent officers who afterwards became great and successful commanders of armies, and even in naval warfare, without training in military of naval science, and even without experience except when in command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>Illustrious examples have been presented in <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Cromwell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00093" reg="mostcommon:Cromwell,nomatch:0"><surname>Cromwell</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>Such cases of natural fitness for military operations and command when indicated in a civilian, or proved by the deeds of an inferior officer in service, should be carefully cherished, and put to use. --Such civilians may be safely appointed to military office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>And such officers, if of inferior grades, should be promoted to high positions, and if already of high rank, should be kept employed in some of the most important commands and services.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>There are such officers and commanders, now in our service, who have well proved their right to marked distinction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>But such <hi rend="italics">born</hi> <rs type="role" reg="military-Officer">military officers</rs> and commanders have been but few, and the existence of any such should be considered (in advance of facts for proof) as exceptions, and rare exceptions, to the general and proper rule for appointments to office, viz: that previous instruction and practical training are essential for every man who is to be entrusted with high military command &mdash; whether of a regiment only, a brigade, or of an army.--The envy excuse for any departure from this rule, in appointing or promoting officers to high grades, is when there is an absolute deficiency of individuals even partially so qualified. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/> The most condemnable, inexcusable, and dangerous error which has been committed in the general direction of the war in which we are now engaged, (and for the best success in which we need to employ every element of military strength,) is the conferring of high military positions and commands on individuals who had no military training or experience, or in whom, at most, a mere <placeName reg="West Point, Troup, Georgia" key="tgn,2024703">West Point</placeName> education, followed by peaceful service as a subaltern, for a short time, and which ceased many years ago, is paraded by apologists as sufficient evidence of fitness for the command of a brigade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>There have been far too many of such appointments as <rs type="role2">Colonels</rs> and <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, the inducing motives of which may have been the political eminence of the appointees, or otherwise mere favor, but certainly not because of any military knowledge, or peculiar natural genius or fitness of the favored individuals &mdash; By possibility and rare chance, some <num value="1">one</num> or more of these appointees may possess natural military talents unknown to themselves when they solicited such promotion, and certainly unsuspected by the appointing authorities, and may hereafter, if opportunity should offer, exhibit the military talents of a Cromwell or a Jackson; but the probability and the chances are a <num value="1000">thousand</num> to <num value="1">one</num>, that in the far greater number of such cases, there will be found, on trial, as much want of capacity and of efficiency of such officers, as there was deficiency of wisdom and statesman like policy in their appointment. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/> --In the war in which we are engaged rank is not the synonym of honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>The most honorable position in this contest is that of the private soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>His position is anything but a degraded <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>It is, indeed, most honorable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>He is no enlisted mercenary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>He is a volunteer in the service of his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>He comes forward at his country's call, offering to fight her battles, with out name or the chance of fame, without rank or pay. He comes forward is the spirit of perfect self-sacrifice, giving up home, comfort, everything; proffering to run the gauntlet of disease and to brave death at the cannon's mouth for no possible reward or return, but the consciousness of having served his country in her time of need.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>The fable of the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> Cartius is the best typification of the self immolation of the <rs>Southern</rs> private soldier The officer fights, in part at least, for pay; the private from pure, self-sacrificing patriotism. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/> How warmly does the private soldier enlist the affectionate sympathies of the <rs>Southern</rs> heart!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>No generous man or true woman can see an emaciated soldier, was with disease and bent with suffering, walking feebly along our streets, without the deepest emotions of respect and kindest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>What a contrast between the feelings inspired by such a spectacle and those provoked by the gay trimmings and pert assurance of the throngs of officers who seem to dwell upon our streets, instead of patiently and honorably devoting themselves to their duties in camp. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/> These officers greatly mistake the times and the temper of the people who think that rank in any passport now to popular estimation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>We know of but <num value="1">one</num> advantage that rank can confer, and that is its additional pay. The people are as ready to honor a Captain who does his duty faithfully as a <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major-General</rs> or a General in Chief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>They will pay honor to the faithful <rs>Captain</rs> or General; but they love the private soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>Witness the immense contributions of the people to the comforts of the troops in this war, and no <num value="1">one</num> will question the fast that it is the private soldier who stands in the affectionate and tender sympathies of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>The same may be said of many of our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>; but we venture to predict that these will be the men upon whom the people hereafter will be most ready to heap their honors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>History also will delight to take care of their fame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>It is the private soldier who is <q>&#x0022;<num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in the heart of his countrymen&#x0022;</q> now. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/> In so large an army as that of the <rs>South</rs>, it is impossible but that merit will often tail to secure promotion, and that want of merit will even more often obtain it; and this from no abuse of authority by the appointing power out from accident, misinformation, error in judgment, or mere mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>But what if case of this sort do happen; merit will be no loser by the neglect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>The people are more apt to criticize and censure high rank; their sympathies are always with the brave humble in rank. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/> In regular, standing armies, promotion the life's object of an officer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>It is for this that he lives, and of this that he dreams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>To be overslaughed is to be buried alive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>But our is not a standing army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>It is an improvised establishment, that exists only for the emergency of the war, and after that will be utterly dissolved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>In the regular army that shall succeed is rank will resume its wonted importance and become again a thing of substance to the officer and cease to be an affair of mere form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>But now, all have volunteered for the war, and have enlisted to fight for the common cause leaving it to the country, or to accident, to assign them their respective positions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>The bought of the country are turned upon the enemy; and the only solicitude of the soldier whether he have a commission or only has a place upon the muster roll is, to be where he can have his blow at the invader. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/> The true sentiment of the fighters in this contest, is that of indifference to rank and obviousness on the whole subject of promotion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>The country will hold Government responsible for the capacity of its appointees; that is an affair of its own. It would prefer to look after that matter itself at the fitting time, and will honor the soldier and the officer the more meantime, according as he ignores the whole subject of relative rank and position. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/> The hardest fighting and most trying service in this contest is precisely in those quarters in which here are likely to be the rarest promotions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>Probably the hardest fighting that has over occurred on this continent has been in <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName>, certainly the severest service that has been known since the winter of <placeName reg="Valley Forge, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,2024594">Valley Forge</placeName> has been in <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>It is not in such quarters that mere military eclat or rapid military promotion is won; for these occur only where vast armies are massed and engagements on a large scale are expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>The country will not forget the fields of additions service, or the men that perform it; yet it would frown with severity upon them if they should turn their eyes a moment from the enemy to fix them upon the tawdry insignia of rank. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/> That the <rs>Government</rs> has made mistakes to the very difficult and delicate task of promotions is possible; but the public safety requires that these mistakes shall be overlooked by the soldier and forgiven by the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>It is impossible that all the merit now teeming in our army can be properly honored and distinguished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>Some of the best talent and choices, merit in the country has been from the beginning in the ranks, and from the nature of the case must remain there to the end of the war. In this struggle, men of all ranks and grades must fight &mdash; not for self, or personal fame, or the hope of reward or promotion; but for the cause alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>Any other principle of action would at once demoralize the service, and give the cause over to destruction. </p> </div3>
