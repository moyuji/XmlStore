<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>From their flags of truce, from the telegraphic dispatches in their own newspapers, and from the news circulated everywhere through the <rs>South</rs>, there can be little doubt of the success of this great naval enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/> It may be asked why we have not official news from the fleet itself, or say sort of correct intelligence from it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>If New York had seen it to hold back from this accursed war, it could not have been waged, nor could she have been dragooned into it by any power at the command of the <rs>General Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>She need not have proclaimed herself a free city, as some of her journals before Secession hypocritically pretended she would.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>We know that by the blessing of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> upon the resistless spirit of our people, every blow that our foes have dealt us has recoiled with <num value="10">ten</num>-fold fierceness and destruction upon their own heads.
