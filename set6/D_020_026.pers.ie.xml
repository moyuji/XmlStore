<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>I often wish that the world were more interested and generous, and less disinterested and scrupulous, in meting out honors to heroes; for why should not the man who has gained a victory over himself be as great as a C&#x0152;sar and be honored accordingly ?

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/> My follow-passengers consisted of soldiers and civilians the former going to join their respective regiments, having been either sick or on furlough; the latter bent on errands of mercy or duty, although I am inclined to think, that several were actuated by no higher impulse than that of gratifying a morbid curiosity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/><num value="1">One</num> man, who had been a sailor in the U S service, particularly amused me.--He had now been metamorphosed into a soldier and appeared proud of the change, for he observed, <q>&#x0022;You can make a soldier out of a sailor, but shiver my timbers if you can make a sailor out of a soldier&#x0022;</q> He at <num value="1">one</num> time addressed his comrades in a hoarse voice, meant, doubtlessly, as innocently ironical of a certain gallant General who had lost his voice after a few hours campaigning at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>In palliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>I must observe that the offender was &#x0022;half-seas over,&#x0022; and evidently thought it no harm to burlesque the man for whom he was going to fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The journey, although disagreeably protracted, weat on well enough until the train reached <placeName key="tgn,2111971" n="1.000 34" reg="gordonsville, orange, virginia">Gordonsville</placeName>, where I was detained nearly an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Meanwhile numbers of people had congregated about the station intent upon the same journey Some of them had no passed at all, and I undertook to intercedes with <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> in behalf of a clergyman and his young daughter, (who intended administering spiritual consolation to the wounded) should they meet with any difficulty upon their arrival at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Devotion certainly actuated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>me in this proffer of friendship; but it was more influenced by feelings of gallantry than religion, although I trust I am not waiting in the latter respect on suitable times and occasions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Where is the man who will not put himself out of the way when a lady is in the way ? That there are not many, if any, such to be found in the <rs>South</rs>, I am convinced; for within its warm regions the ancient spirit of chivalry has made her abode I While awaiting the car I took a view of some wounded men just brought in, whom the enemy had left on the field in their hasty flight during the previous <rs>Sunday</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Their wounds were in a fearful condition, so much so indeed that the miserable objects were almost unapproachable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>They were stretched in cars upon blankets, furnished to them by those whose land they came to invade, and were only awaiting transit to a neighboring hospital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>After having my patience tolerably well tried, the train for <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> at length arrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>A general rush was instantly made for the cars, which happened, however, to be already full Nevertheless, crowds of people mounted the steps, and after blocking up the intermediate passages of the cars, took up positions outside, some even mounting to the roofs, to the great danger of their necks and limbs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Here, slated by the success of <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>'s victory, some volunteers &mdash; who were <hi rend="italics">not</hi> in the fight &mdash; commenced indulging in Terpsichorean amusements, until I positively thought they would come through the roof, to the manifest peril of their less jubilant companions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>To avert such a calamity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>I knocked up powerfully with my umbrella, a thing for which I have a peculiar attachment --and a worse might be formed; but it was of no avail.-- On they danced, the fragile timbers yielding and creaking beneath their lusty tread, which was anything but a manifestation of &#x0022;the light fantastic toe&#x0022; business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Worn out by the exertion &mdash; for pleasure is always a pain &mdash; they finally desisted to my infinite composure and satisfaction Mean while I had been undergoing the horrors of suffocation; while it afforded me no relief to find that others were similarly situated Feeling anything but comfortable, and somewhat apprehensive of continuing in so confined a position, I made a desperate effort to regain the front of the ear. Had I a robust body, I dare not have attempted such a struggle; indeed, as it was, my poor <hi rend="italics">corpus</hi> got nearly squeezed to nothing!-- <q>&#x0022;Thank Heaven!&#x0022;</q> I said, on accomplishing my object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/><q>&#x0022;I now breathe freely at last!&#x0022;--</q> Here, in front of the car, with scarcely room to stand erect, and nothing to hold on by, I continued for nearly an hour, with a group of some half dozen or more persons, who had sought the same refuge, for companions By and by an additional car was attached to the train, which, however, but slightly relieved the over-crowding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>We jogged on slowly &mdash; very slowly, half baked from the sun, who sent his piercing rays right through the frail timberwork to the evident discomfort of its crowded occupants. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/> Occasionally the train would play the most per tenacious pranks and cut the most cabalistic capers While jogging on the &#x0022;even tenor of its way&#x0022;--which it seldom kept for any considerable time &mdash; suddenly it would take an unaccountable retrograde movement, then bound for ward with a jerk that lifted me from my feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Now, perhaps it would half without any assignable reason, and the next minute roll back ward with a very unuphonious sound, just for all the world as if the railroad were a chess-board, and that the train was provokingly bent upon playing a game ! These violent and repeated movements, hither and this her, anywhere and no where, coupled with the oppressive heat, created exhaustion, which necessarily excited thirst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>But the temperate but temporary relief of water was not available.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Some of the vessels appropriated for this purpose had been broken, all the others had run dry, and seemed in a lamentable condition of drought themselves.--In vain was the faucet turned, re-turned and man&#x0152;uvered in various ways Not <num value="1">one</num> drop of liquid would reward the toll of the most persevering and delicate operator!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>At length, after much weary waiting, the train arrived at a station, when cries of <q>&#x0022;Water,&#x0022;</q> <q>&#x0022;Water,&#x0022;</q> <q>&#x0022;Bring us some water&#x0022;</q> resounded from every car. A little negro girl, who had been present, rushed to the rescue, and having procured a bucket of this cooling liquid, handed it to <num value="1">one</num> of the passengers, who sent it round till the contents were exhausted, when it was replenished again and again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>In this manner were all the thirsty souls supplied --The little negro girl of whom I speak has done &#x0022;the <rs>State</rs> some service&#x0022; by her attention to our soldiers that day, and I see no reason why such a meritorious act should go unrecorded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>I love to see &#x0022;virtue,&#x0022; even in the dark race--&#x0022;in humble life,&#x0022; more especially when, as in the present instance, it is &#x0022;its own reward!&#x0022; Surely, however, the railway direction should manage things better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Finally, after much fumbling and grumbling, we arrived at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, rather late in the afternoon A scene of confusion ensued more easily imagined than described; in fact, it baffles description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Soldiers were vainly inquiring the way to their regiments, which they could not find; relatives were as fruitlessly seeking the whereabouts of their friends, while others (spectators, I suppose,) did not know where to go or what to do I never beheld such looks of utter discomfiture as I witnessed on many countenances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>The little hotel at the <rs type="place">Junction</rs> where <num value="1">one</num> might perchance have got a trifle to eat, and perhaps a bed on the boards, was now turned into a hospital, and its stout lusty host gone, Heaven knows where!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Good fortune go with thee, my old jovial friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>Mayhap <num value="1">one</num> day I might see thee proprietor of the &#x0022; Cock&#x0022;in <address><street n="Fleet street">Fleet street</street></address>! It so, I shall often step in to taste thy liquor during my nocturnal peregrinations in that quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>But this <hi rend="italics">on passant.</hi> To return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>The young lady (and her &#x0022;papa&#x0022;) whom I had taken under my protection, and to whom I had proffered my friendly offices, was nowhere to be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>I looked about in vain, but it appeared to me as if the earth had swallowed her up; so I had to abandon further pursuit of the interesting creature-- rendered interesting solely, i assure you, on account of the prose worthy mission upon which she was bent I &mdash; for who does not love and admire a woman when she becomes a messenger of mercy? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/> As time was advancing, and the shades of evening were closing fast over the busy scene, it was urgent that I should make a move.--<num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> of all, I started for <placeName><persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName>'s headquarters</placeName>; but to my surprise I was informed that he had removed, with his staff, to another house, some <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles distant</measure>.-- Weak, and indeed hungry, for I had tasted nothing solid all day, I wandered for a while about, when I met with a friend, to whom I told my position. &#x0022;Oh,&#x0022; said he, &#x0022;<rs type="role2">Major</rs> W &mdash; has a marques yonder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>Another strong fact connected with the subject is, that, although <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> has more slaves within her borders than any other State in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, the proportion of volunteers to white people furnished by her slaveholding districts, exceeds <num value="0.1">ten per cent.</num> </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/> Indeed, it has always been considered in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> that a levy of <num value="0.07">seven per cent</num> of the population was entirely practicable; and if this be so, where all the labor of the community is performed by the race from which the levy is made, much more is it true, when the great bulk of the labor is done by a distinct race forming no part of the class from which the conscription is taken. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/> It may be assumed, therefore, with perfect safety, that the <rs>South</rs> can bring <num value="560000">five hundred and sixty thousand</num> men into the field, without perceptibly embarrassing her agriculture or her industry of any sort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>She may spare this number of soldiers from her population, and still raise <num value="5000000">five millions</num> of bales of cotton, worth <num value="250000000">two hundred and fifty millions</num> of dollars, her usual complement of tobacco, rice and sugar, and cereal crops and meats in addition, more than sufficient for home consumption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>If the worst should come to the worst, she could even add <num value="0.04">four per cent</num> more to the army ratio, raising her force to <num value="1">one</num> <num value="7" type="ordinal">seventh</num> the white population, and adding a reserve of <num value="220000">two hundred and twenty thousand</num> troops to the <num value="0.1">ten per cent</num> conscription.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>There is no sufficient reason why this disparity of force should always attend our military operations.

<head>A <rs type="ship2">Zouave</rs>'s account of bowie-knife fighting.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/> A Washington correspondent of the <orgName n="Baltimore Sun" type="newspaper">Baltimore Sun</orgName> writes: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/> <num value="1">One</num> of the <rs>New York Fire Zouaves</rs>, who was wounded at the <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">battle of Manassas</rs> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> week, a stalwart, hardy fellow, of considerable intelligence, passed through this city yesterday, <hi rend="italics">en route</hi> homeward, remaining here several hours waiting for the cars.--He, of course, has the privilege, like all others, of telling his own tale, without apprehending, for the present at least, successful contradiction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>From him I obtained a thrilling narrative of a rencontre between his regiment and a regiment of Mississippians. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/> After the battle had been raging for some hours, according to the account of this Zouavian hero, he saw an immense body of Mississippians, accompanied by some (believed to be) Baltimoreans, rush furiously ever the <name n="Confederate States">Confederate</name> ramparts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>They at once saw the conspicuous uniform of the <name>Zouaves</name>, and made at them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>The <rs>Mississippians</rs>, after approaching near enough, sent a terrible volley from their rifles into the <rs>Zouave</rs> ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>This done, they threw their guns aside and charged onward until each contending enemy met face to face and hand to hand, in terrible combat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>The <rs>Mississippians</rs>, having discarded their rifle after the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> fire, fell back upon their <rs n="bowie knives" type="product">bowie-knives</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>These were of huge dimensions, <num value="18">eighteen</num> to <measure n="20inches" type="distance">twenty inches</measure> long, heavy in proportion and sharp, or <num value="2">two</num>-edged at the point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>Attached to the handle was a lasso, some <num value="8">eight</num> or <measure n="10feet" type="distance">ten feet</measure> in length, with <num value="1">one</num> end securely wound round the wrist. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/> My informant says when these terrific warriors approached to within reach of their lasso, not waiting to come in bayonet range, they threw forward their <rs n="bowie knives" type="product">bowie-knives</rs> at the <name>Zouaves</name> after the fashion of experienced harpooners striking at a whale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>Frequently they plunged in, and penetrated through a soldier's body, and were jerked out, ready to strike again whilst the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> victim sunk into death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/>On several occasions the terrible bowie-knife was transfixed in a Zouave, and the <rs>Zouave</rs>'s bayonet in a Mississippian, both impaled and falling together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>So skillfully was this deadly instrument handled by the <rs>Mississippian</rs> that he could project it to the full lasso length, kill his victim, withdraw it again with a sudden impulse, and catch the handle unerringly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/> If by any mischance the bowie-knife missed its aim, broke the cord fastening it to the arm, or fell to the earth, revolvers were next resorted to and used with similar dexterity.--The hand-to-hand closing in with both pistol and bowie knife, cutting, slashing, carving and shooting almost in the same moment, was awful beyond description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>Blood gushed from hundreds of wounds, until, amid death, pitiful groans and appalling sights, it staunched the very earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>My Zouave champion says himself and comrades did hard fighting, stood up manfully to the murderous conflict, but never before knew what undaunted bravery and courage meant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>He felt no further ambition to engage in such rencontres.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>Having been shot through the wrist by a revolver, after escaping the fearful <placeName reg="Mississippi, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> weapons, and disabled from further active participation in the struggle, he willingly retired to reap the glory won, convinced that to fight against Mississippians, with <rs n="bowie knives" type="product">bowie knives</rs> and pistols, after receiving a volley of their sharp-cracking rifles, is no ordinary fun. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/> This same informant states, though not with certainty, that several Baltimoreans were with the <name>Mississippians</name>, and amongst those of them left dead on the field was a young man named <persName n="Murry,,William,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00349" reg="default:Murry,William,H.,,"><foreName n="William">Wm.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Murry</surname></persName>, a Captain of the <orgName type="mil" key="MDGuard">Maryland Guard</orgName>--at least such was the name told him &mdash; and another, who he thinks was called <persName n="Polk,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00350" reg="nearbymention:Polk,W.,H.,,"><surname>Polk</surname></persName>, both of <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>. </p> </q><bibl n="A Washington correspondent of the Baltimore Sun"></bibl></cit> </div4>
