<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>He did not see any cause to apprehend that any party intends to make war on the seceding States.--He only asserted the right to do so, if we see fit. He would not advise or counsel to it.--He would be very tender of the rights of the people, who were about to break up a government under which they had deliberately come to the conclusion that they could not live.--But he apprehended that the necessities of our position would compel us to take an austere ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>Why not accept this settlement as a disposition of the whole controversy?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>Nobody's opinion will be compromised by such a course.--It will be a mere acquiescence in the decisions of the tribunal which the <rs>Constitution</rs> created to decide such questions &mdash; Why cannot the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> in Congress take this view of the subject, and vote for a declaratory resolution affirming such a settlement?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>Why cannot <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> avow his acceptance of this ruling of the co-ordinate branch of the government, to which the decision of the subject properly belongs, and his determination in his official action to abide by it?

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/> But it is possible that all parties may prefer that an adjustment, substantially upon the basis which we have proposed, should assume the form of an amendment of the <rs>Constitution</rs> &mdash; and we can appreciate that some not willing to accept it as a true exposition of the meaning of the <rs>Constitution</rs> in its present form, may, nevertheless, be quite willing to adopt it and engraft it upon the fundamental law. The Constitution is singularly obscure upon the subject of power over the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>Such power as has been hither to exercised has been rather inferred from that instrument than founded upon any express provisions touching this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>Might it not be well to follow a declaratory exposition by Congress, with an amendment of the <rs>Constitution</rs> to the following effect: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/> &#x0022;The Congress may establish governments for the <rs>Territories</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; and any Territory having a population equal to the constituency of <num value="1">one</num> member of Congress, and having adopted, by a vote of the citizens of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> resident therein, a Constitution, <rs n="Republican" type="political">republican</rs> in form, may be admitted by the <rs>Congress</rs> into this Union as a State; and neither the <rs>Congress</rs>, nor the people of a Territory, during the territorial condition, shall, by legislation or otherwise, annul or impair rights of property recognized by the laws of any of the <name>States</name>.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/> This amendment is drawn in harmony with the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>It does not mention the word slavery, and yet it fully covers the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>It also defines the power of Congress over the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> and contains wholesome provision about the admission of new States, which will be appreciated without further explanation. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/> We appeal to the <rs>North</rs>, to the reasonable, thinking men of all parties, whether there is anything dishonorable or humiliating on the part of this section of the <rs>Union</rs>, in settling the pending difficulties on the terms which we have proposed?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>We insist there is not, and that, in the face of dangers, the extent and calamity of which no human foresight can measure, there ought not to be any hesitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>So far as the question of interest is concerned, we should be ashamed of our section of the <rs>Union</rs> if it feared to trust itself to the freest and most open competition in the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>, with the men, the labor, the property and the enterprise of any of the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>We are quite willing to take the chances, that, when new States come to be formed, their influence and their ideas will predominate in all territory adapted by climate and soil to our Northern cultivation, and it requires no generosity on our part to surrender the residue to our Southern brethren. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/> --A new doctrine is being promulgated by All the <rs>Year Round</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>Hear it: &#x0022;We laugh at the women's tongue, and wonder when a woman keeps a secret, but every true woman keeps a box of choice reserves for her own private indulgence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>The man's mysteries are not hers; if he cannot keep them to himself let him expect them to be blown abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>Her own secrets of love, of loss, of self-denial, of unsuspected suffering, no woman exposes altogether, even to her nearest friend.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>There never lived a husband happy in the true love of his wife, who fairly knew all the depths of her mind about him. Every man profits stupidly by the wise little perceptions except in deeds, of which we vaguely ascribe the fitness to a special faculty called woman's fact. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/> Women, in short, keep to themselves <num value="4">four</num>-<num value=".2">fifths</num> of the secrets of society, and do it with a winning air of frankness all their own. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/> A man with a secret will be stony, or pretentious, or provokingly suggestive!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>he will keep his mouth ostentatiously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>A woman is too absolutely secret to set up a public sign over whatever may lie buried in her mind.--She gossips, prattles, pours out what she does not care to hold, with such an air of unreserved simplicity that all mankind is mystified, and says in friendly jest, 'a woman only hides what she don't know.'

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>Among the uneducated poor this difference between the woman and the man is most conspicuous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>The innate powers of her sex place her at once upon an eminence which man can only reach by education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>She must often be tied to <num value="1">one</num> in whom there is often not the grain of understanding requisite to the formation of true sympathy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>By far the greater number of the wives of unskilled laborers and mechanics, live more or less happily, and more or less conscious of the hidden life within them, having such a seal upon their minds and heart.&#x0022; </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/>The lady, after lifting the veil, which hid a not unhandsome face, intimated, in a style corresponding with her dress, that, hearing there was a vacancy in the gentleman's service, she desired to be engaged by him as a house-maid. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/> The gentleman stated that his &#x0022;better half&#x0022; was at her residence in the suburbs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>The following dialogue ensued: </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/> Servant girl, (in a querulous and dissatisfied tone.)--Then you reside in the country &mdash; that would be so inconvenient. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/> Gentleman.--But then we could remove to town. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/> Servant girl.--And the washing, I am given to understand, is done at home, which I don't much like. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/> Gentleman.--But then we could give that out. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/> Servant girl.--And are there any children? </p>
