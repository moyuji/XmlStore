<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/> The recent battle near <placeName reg="Murfreesboro, Rutherford, Tennessee" key="tgn,7014175">Murfreesboro</placeName>' has been a very mysterious affair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>Telegraphers to Southern journals have very much aided in shrouding it in log. <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00209" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Braxton,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName>'s <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> dispatches impressed all with the belief in a glorious victory, and <unclear></unclear> prepared us for the retreat to <placeName key="tgn,2101873" n="1.000 68" reg="tullahoma, coffee, tennessee">Tullahoma</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>His Aid had informed us that it was to <placeName reg="Shelbyville, Bedford, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101476">Shelbyville</placeName> that he had retreated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>As <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00210" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Braxton,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName> himself names the former place of course we take it that there he must be. <placeName key="tgn,2101873" n="1.000 68" reg="tullahoma, coffee, tennessee">Tullahoma</placeName> is some <placeName><distance reg="30miles">thirty miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Murfreesboro, Rutherford, Tennessee" key="tgn,7014175">Murfreesboro</placeName></placeName>', on the <orgName n="Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad" type="railroad">Nashville and Chattanooga railroad</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/> <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00211" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Braxton,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName> telegraphs that he could not drive the enemy from his entrenchments, and learning that he was reinforced he thought proper to withdraw to the point he had reached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>We suppose those entrenchments must have been his <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> line, as it was understood that he had been driven from his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> position, with the loss of <measure n="4000" type="prisoners">4,000 prisoners</measure>, <num value="31">31</num> pieces of artillery, and some <num value="200">200</num> wagons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>That <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00212" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Braxton,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName> retreated with his prisoners, captured arms, &#x0026;c., together with his own stores, proves that the enemy was not in a proper condition for pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>Indeed, <num value="1">one</num> of the ridiculous Southern dispatches says that he, too, was retreating towards <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>It has been said that <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00213" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Braxton,,,"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName> and the enemy both retreated rapidly at <placeName reg="Perryville, Boyle, Kentucky" key="tgn,7017532">Perryville</placeName> from each other; but this strange occurrence in military proceedings can hardly have been repeated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/> There can be no doubt that our army at <placeName reg="Murfreesboro, Rutherford, Tennessee" key="tgn,7014175">Murfreesboro</placeName>' was greatly outnumbered by the enemy, under <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00214" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>That it fought most gloriously and gained a brilliant advantage is cleared. --The enemy confess to an immense loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>It is stated by <num value="2">two</num> writers at <num value="25000">25,000</num> and <num value="20000">20,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>The latter number, we conjecture, is larger than our entire force under <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00215" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Braxton,,,"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>The figures may be too large; but they argue, at least, an immense loss by the invaders. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/> The retreat from <placeName reg="Murfreesboro, Rutherford, Tennessee" key="tgn,7014175">Murfreesboro</placeName>' is unfortunate for us and for the <rs type="role" reg="Commanding-General">Commanding General</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>Retreats are generally considered defeats, and though our General carried off his prisoners, &#x0026;c., the moral effect of the move robs him, in a measure, of the meed of his achievements in the <num value="2">two</num> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and glorious days before <placeName reg="Murfreesboro, Rutherford, Tennessee" key="tgn,7014175">Murfreesboro</placeName>'. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/> The new position, it may be supposed, is still favorable for strategic movements, if reinforcements can be in time brought up. <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00216" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,Joe,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> will no doubt repair to the scene, and do what is possible to put our affairs in proper trim, and arrange for the defence of <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>--a part of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> that we cannot afford to lose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>We have faith in our men and in the <rs>Commander</rs> of the <rs>Southwest</rs>, and we look for brilliant advantages for our cause during the winter campaign. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
