<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The crisis was <num value="1">one</num> requiring the patriotic efforts of every member.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The resolution, if adopted, would have an effect to place <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> in a hostile attitude to the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, which at present was <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>'s Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The secession movement thus far had been exactly in conformity with the programme laid down by the editors of the <orgName n="Richmond Enquirer" type="newspaper">Richmond <hi rend="italics">Enquirer</hi></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>He proceeded to pay his respects to the editors of that paper, reading copious extracts from its columns by way of illustration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>He had no doubt they understood their programme well, but they would never be able to succeed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> He believed these resolutions were prepared before <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s Inaugural made its appearance, and maintained that <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> should not be thus committed without consulting with the people-- that she should not be plunged into the horrors of civil war by a mere act of this advisory power. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> The speaker then read from <persName n="Wise,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:Wise,O.,J.,,:1"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName>'s speech to the <orgName type="regiment" key="NY7">New York Seventh Regiment</orgName>, when they brought hither the remains of <persName n="Monroe,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Monroe,nomatch:0"><surname>Monroe</surname></persName>--<measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> ago &mdash; declaratory of his faith in the <rs>Union</rs> as the work of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> Almighty; also, from another address, delivered by the <rs>Governor</rs> in this city, in <date value="1859-05">May, 1859,</date> closing with a toast to the &#x0022;Union and the <rs>Constitution</rs>, as they are.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> Yet we were called to pledge ourselves to a support of rebellious States against our native land or to participate in a foreign alliance against that land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>He declared he was agreeably disappointed in the pacific tone which breathes throughout the whole of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s Inaugural Address.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>It was well that the people could read it, and judge for themselves, without taking newspaper comments for their guide in forming a judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>He went on to read from <persName n="Buchanan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,nomatch:0"><surname>Buchanan</surname></persName>'s special message in <dateStruct value="-12-"><month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct> last, to show that they stood alike upon the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>And yet because <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> had expressed his constitutional views of the action of States which he (<rs type="role">Mr.</rs> C.) believed were in open rebellion against the <rs>Government</rs>, <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> was also to be dragged into rebellion and civil war. He was not here as an apologist for <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00030" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, but believed that he would not have dared to acknowledge the right of the secession of States. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> He next alluded to <persName n="Goggin,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00031" reg="mostcommon:Goggin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Goggin</surname></persName> as a member of the <orgName n="Whig Convention" type="convention">Whig Convention</orgName> which adopted a platform for the preservation of the <rs>Union</rs> and the <rs>Constitution</rs> &mdash; and he believed the gentleman from <placeName reg="Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada" key="tgn,7013046">Halifax</placeName> (<persName n="Flournoy,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00032" reg="mostcommon:Flournoy,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Flournoy</surname></persName>) stood there also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>They backed up <persName n="Fillmore,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00033" reg="mostcommon:Fillmore,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Fillmore</surname></persName>, as he did, in enforcing the laws in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>; but now when they were to be enforced on this side of the line, it was a very different thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>His people were a law-abiding people; devoted to the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName>, because it was, as they and as he believed, the bulwark of <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Yet they were not to be driven from the <rs>Union</rs> because <num value="1">one</num> had been elevated to the <name>Presidency</name>, through our divisions, who was objectionable to them.--They had yet the <rs>Constitution</rs> to protect them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The Government had never yet brought us anything but good, and no act had been placed there upon the subject of slavery which the <rs>Southern States</rs> did not assent to. We were called upon to destroy a Government that protects us against the consequences of our own mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>We had the right to increase the number of slave States since <date value="1845">1845,</date> but had now only <num value="15">fifteen</num>; and yet we wanted expansion!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Slavery was governed by soil, by climate, by interests; and where those were adverse, it would not go. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> spurned the causes which were alleged here for a dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The present secession movement was initiated in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, where they never lost a slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/><placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> tells you frankly it is because of the &#x0022;irrepressible conflict&#x0022; between free and slave labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The doctrine of the right of a State to secede originated in <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName>, the hot-bed of all the &#x0022;isms,&#x0022; in <date value="1807">1807,</date> because of the embargo.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/> This brought him to the construction of another clause &mdash; the most important of all, and the key to the entire policy; but he was rejoiced when he read it.
