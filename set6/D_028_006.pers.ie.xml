<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> It is said that <persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Seward,William,H.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName> will send a minister to <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, and thus give the final kick to the <rs>Monroe Doctrine</rs>, as hitherto understood in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.--What the <orgName n="U. S. Congress" type="Congress">United States Congress</orgName> or the people of that subjugated country may think of this proceeding, is a matter of supreme indifference to its masters.--Their business is to conquer the <rs>South</rs>, and, if it be necessary for the accomplishment of this object, they will &#x0022;stoop to conquer,&#x0022; no matter what the degradation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Having sacrificed the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Continent for that purpose, they cannot be expected to hesitate at offering up any abstraction, <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Monroe</placeName> or otherwise, which may interfere with their <num value="1">one</num> vital object of overwhelming the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> But, of course, <persName n="Seward,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Seward,William,H.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>, in taking this step, gets a good bargain, and insists upon a substantial consideration for what he gives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/><persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Seward,William,H.,,"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> is to let <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="nearbymention:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> alone, and <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> is to let him alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>All this is very good, as long as it lasts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>That it cannot last always must be plain enough to both parties to the contract.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Both are shrewd, experienced diplomatists, and each is aware of the complete hollowness of the other's purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>If we assume that the <rs>Emperor</rs> of the <rs>French</rs> intends to stand by <persName n="Maximilian,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Maximilian,nomatch:0"><surname>Maximilian</surname></persName>, and render his occupation of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> permanent, he must either believe that the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> will inevitably accomplish its independence, or he is singular credulous of the good faith and honest intentions of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>On the assumption of Southern independence, his conduct in attempting <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> to secure the good will of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> is reconcilable with his character as a sagacious and politic statesman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>He gains time thereby for consolidating the throne of <persName n="Maximilian,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Maximilian,nomatch:0"><surname>Maximilian</surname></persName>, and, so far as the <rs>Confederacy</rs> is concerned, he is safe, at any rate, from interruption from that quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>On the other hand, if he regards our cause as doubtful, and is seeking to make a friend of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> for a rainy day, he is the most gullible, instead of the most sagacious, <rs n="Frenchman" type="propernoun">Frenchman</rs> now alive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>He has studied the character of <persName n="Seward,,William,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="default:Seward,William,H.,,"><foreName n="William">Wm.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName> and the temper of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> people to little purpose if he supposes he or they will be bound by any such contract <num value="1">one</num> moment longer than their political and military necessities require.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>If the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> come out triumphant from this war, it will have a disposable army of at least <num value="300000">three hundred thousand</num> men for the invasion of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>It will have a navy which can blockade every <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> port and compete with the regular navy of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> on the ocean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>It can have a swarm of privateers which will sweep every <name>French</name> merchantman from the ocean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>It will seek to cement its domestic power by enlisting all the military adventurers of the <rs>South</rs>, who will be disbanded at the close of hostilities, in the same grand crusade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>It will be eager to create in hostility to a foreign power a new bond of union for the now warring populations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Is it possible that, foreseeing all this, <persName n="Napoleon,,Louis,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="default:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><foreName>Louis</foreName> <surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> expects to propitiate the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> by agreeing not to interfere on behalf of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>If he does, he is the most gullible of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have always coveted <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>There was respect enough for the opinions of mankind, at the close of the war with that country, combined with ignorance of our own strength, to prevent the wholesale plunder of it at that time from the hands of its own people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>But the world's moral sense cannot be offended by taking that, to which <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> has given up its right, from the hands of those who have compelled it to make the surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> will go to <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> as its deliverers, and the great mass of the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> people will rally around its standard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> is no longer unconscious of its own power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>It it comes out of this war victorious, it will be the vainest and most arrogant military nation on the face of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>And whoever conquers such soldiers as those of this Southern land, even with the odds of <num value="4">four</num> to <num value="1">one</num>, will have no reason to fear any force that <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, or <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> combined, can transport to this continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Within <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> after the conquest of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>, <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> would become part and parcel of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>We are, therefore, led to the conclusion, either that <persName n="Napoleon,,Louis,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="default:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><foreName>Louis</foreName> <surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> has abiding faith in the ability of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> to achieve its independence, or that he has no serious thoughts of the permanent establishment of <persName n="Maximilian,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Maximilian,nomatch:0"><surname>Maximilian</surname></persName> in <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The latter idea is scarcely reconcilable with the deliberation of his character and the tenacity with which he always pursues his objects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The weighty commercial and political considerations which induced him to take so serious a step as the occupation of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> and the establishment of <persName n="Maximilian,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Maximilian,nomatch:0"><surname>Maximilian</surname></persName> on the throne, cannot, we should think, be lightly abandoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>However, we are inclined to think that <persName n="Napoleon,,Louis,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="default:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><foreName>Louis</foreName> <surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> retains his confidence in the ability of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> to make good a resistance which is as vital to the security of the power of <persName n="Maximilian,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Maximilian,nomatch:0"><surname>Maximilian</surname></persName> as it is to the independence of the <rs>Southern States</rs>. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Never, in this, or any other war, has any fort, with the single exception of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName>, been subjected to such an assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/><num value="20000">Twenty thousand</num> shells were thrown into it, during a bombardment the most furious in naval annals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>But the <orgName n="Spartan Band" type="band">Spartan band</orgName> by whom it was defended never dreamed of surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>They left such humiliation to those whom the sight of a few gunboats can paralyze out of chivalry and patriotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The whole Confederacy will do honor to these heroic men. <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName> has reason to be proud of such sons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>No State in the <rs>Confederacy</rs> has contributed more to the common defence, and none can show a more splendid record of courage and resolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The handful <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> of malcontents in her borders should no more be permitted to eclipse the fame of such men as fought at <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName>, and upon a <num value="100">hundred</num> other battle-fields, than the spots on the sun to hide its transcendent glory and brightness. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/> The mine was sunk to the depth of <measure n="20feet" type="distance">twenty feet</measure> below the bottom of the canal, being kept dry during the process of its excavation and alter its completion by means of <num value="2">two</num> hand pumps and an air pump.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>From the main shaft diverged <num value="5">five</num> separate galleries, <num value="1">one</num> of which was placed several feet forward under the bed of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>Fuses were prepared, and by the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day of the new year everything was in readiness for blowing away the barrier and allowing the waters of the <rs>James</rs> to flow freely through the new channel dug for them. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>There was some delay in arranging the fuse, but as the <dateStruct value="-01-01"><occasion>New year's</occasion></dateStruct> sun began to redden in the west, and somewhat less than an hour before its setting, the explosion occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>It was attended with but a slight report; and although dust was thrown to the height of <measure n="100feet" type="distance">one hundred feet</measure>, the concussion was barely sufficient to crack the ice on a mud puddle near the edge of the crevice. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/> The natural inquiry of the public mind now will be as to the effect of the completion of the canal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>Well! however eminently successful it may prove, it, of course, will not enable us to steam straight up to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> with our monitors.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>The most interesting news of the day is brought us by the <rs>Northern</rs> papers, and is the announcement that <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00267" reg="mostcommon:Butler,James,T.,,:1"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>'s much-talked-of <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> <placeName reg="Gap canal">Gap canal</placeName> has at length been completed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>The importance of this news remains to be seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>If it is a success; that is, if it admits the passage through it of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> fleet, it is an important and useful work to the enemy, inasmuch as it puts them about <measure n="6miles" type="distance">six miles</measure> nearer the city by water than they would be had they been obliged to make the trip around <persName n="Farrar,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00268" reg="mostcommon:Farrar,nomatch:0"><surname>Farrar</surname></persName>'s island, which is the name of the peninsula of which <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> gap was the isthmus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>If it proves unnavigable to monitors and gunboats, the whole vast undertaking is so much time and labor lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>But even should it float the monitors comfortably, it is yet to be tested whether our batteries on the south side of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName> and west of the gap will not effectually blockade its navigation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>We think they will. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> tell us the canal has <measure n="15feet" type="distance">fifteen feet</measure> of water in it at high tide.--Its length is <measure n="560feet" type="distance">five hundred and sixty feet</measure>; its width, <measure n="40yards" type="distance">forty yards</measure>. The cut through the ridge of the isthmus, at its highest point, to the water line is <measure n="59feet" type="distance">fifty-nine feet</measure>. The work was begun on the <date value="08-10">10th of August;</date> and the western end, which had been left untouched till the rest of the canal was finished, to protect the laborers against our batteries, was blown out last <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>--the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day of this year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation are making a great glorification over the completion of this work, and volumes of praise are being lavished on <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00269" reg="mostcommon:Butler,James,T.,,:1"><surname>Butler</surname></persName> for originating the canal scheme and prosecuting it to a successful conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>It is, as we have said, only so far successful that the gap has been out through and the out filled with water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>It advancing the enemy in the siege of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> is another matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>Even should the monitors sail through, it may be found that they have not improved their location over much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>We may, however, expect them to attempt the excursion at an early day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/> <num value="1">One</num> of the most remarkable things about the completion of this canal is, to us, the fact that it should be done right under our noses, (<rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> gap being, as the crow flies, only <placeName><distance reg="12miles">twelve miles</distance> from <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName></placeName>,) and yet we heard not <num value="1">one</num> word of it until the news was brought to us from New York. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/> Very heavy cannonading was heard in the direction of the <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> <placeName reg="Gap canal">Gap canal</placeName> yesterday morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>We presume the firing from our batteries will be kept up continually now, and may be expected to be tremendous whenever the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> monitor shall show its nose in the canal. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>Red or grey is often found to have changed to auburn or black; and, stranger still, heads that have been previously covered with black or dark brown hair are seen, on their return to town, to be covered with luxuriant crops of flaxen curls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>The amazement of the unsophisticated servant had been fast deepening into horror, as he witnessed these successive transformations; and when the ex-dandy, stooping towards his lower extremities, proceeded to unfasten a pair of false calves, the valet imaging that his master was going to take himself completely to pieces, exclaimed, in a tone of mingled anxiety and terror: &#x0022;Oh, monsieur le marquis, pray do leave enough of you for me to put into the bed.&#x0022; </p> </div3>
