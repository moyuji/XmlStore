<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> As it seems many contradictory opinions prevail in regard to the fight at <placeName reg="Sharpsburg, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7014501">Sharpsburg</placeName>, on the <num value="17" type="ordinal">17th</num> inst, I think it may not prove altogether uninteresting to some of your readers to have a statement of facts, which, though not complete, yet you may rely upon them so far as they go; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> On <date>Sunday</date>, the <dateStruct value="--14"><day reg="14">14th</day></dateStruct>, the <orgName>corps of <persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName></orgName> was encamped near <placeName reg="Hagerstown, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7013681">Hagerstown</placeName>, between that place and a village called <placeName key="tgn,2047178" n="1.000 52" reg="funkstown, washington, maryland">Funkstown</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The artillery of <persName n="Pendleton,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Pendleton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Pendleton</surname></persName>, and the battalion to which I am attached, commanded by <persName n="Lee,Colonel,S.,D.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="default:Lee,S.,D.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <foreName>S.</foreName> <foreName>D.</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, encamped on <date>Saturday</date>, the <dateStruct value="--13"><day reg="13">13th</day></dateStruct>, near the latter village, and remained there till <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time>, at <time value="4oclock">4 o'clock</time>. Up to this time the army (I mean the body of it) were evidently under the impression that we would soon go into <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Why we did not go on <hi rend="italics">faster</hi> was a matter of frequent inquiry; but such was the confidence in our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> that no distrust existed, and no sort of anxiety on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The army bad preserved the greatest caution in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> in regard to private property &mdash; much more so than in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> &mdash; and this, too, to their great discomfort and inconvenience, and many <unclear> ned</unclear> to go on in order to get rid of this embarrassment &mdash; When, therefore, the order came, <unclear><persName n="Sabba,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Sabba,nomatch:0"><surname>Sabba</surname></persName> </unclear> afternoon, to countermarch towards <placeName reg="Frederick City">Frederick City</placeName>, there were many sad faces, and many earnest inquiries as to the cause of this retrograde movement: The people of the town saw us pass through their streets with the same indifference that they beheld us enter the town the day before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>We continued our march (the whole of <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName>) toward the <q>&#x0022;Gap,&#x0022;</q> some <measure n="8miles" type="distance">eight miles</measure> south, and when in <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure> of it we were halted; and I was informed upon what I regarded as the very best authority, (a <rs type="role" reg="Brigadier-General">Brigadier General</rs>,) that an artillery fight was going on in the gap, of no importance, and that we had better go into camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>From this encampment we could distinctly see the shells of the enemy burst in the gap where our men were posted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> This gap is in the range of mountains that separates <placeName reg="Frederick City">Frederick City</placeName> from <placeName reg="Hagerstown, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7013681">Hagerstown</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>I learned later in the day that the affair in this gap was more serious than at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> supposed, and it was said that there had been much mismanagement somewhere It seems but a small force had been left to guard it, and that the defence had been committed to a subordinate (a Colonel, I was told,) who knew nothing of the ground, and that <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName> having massed his large force there, our men were badly cut up, and but for <persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>'s arrival, would have been terribly handled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>I was also informed that the army would fall back towards the <rs>Potomac</rs> that night; that <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Thos,,,:2"><roleName n="General">Generals</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> and <persName n="McLaws,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:McLaws,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>McLaws</surname></persName> were engaged in an attack upon <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>, and <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="nearbymention:Lee,S.,D.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> did not think it prudent to engage the whole <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> force in their absence.--This was the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> intimation I had of <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s absence, and I think this fact was not known to the army generally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>It was thought that he was about <placeName reg="Frederick City">Frederick City</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Our horses were kept harnessed, and at <time value="3oclock">3 o'clock</time> <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> was moved by a private road towards the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>At daybreak we encountered <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName> coming into the main road that leads to <placeName reg="Sharpsburg, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7014501">Sharpsburg</placeName> and the ford at <placeName reg="Georgetown, Berkeley, West Virginia" key="tgn,2347734">Shepherdstown</placeName>, and the artillery and infantry moved on together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>At about <time value="10am">10 o'clock A. M.</time> we halted at a village called, I think, Garysville, and took position on some hills south of the town; but in an hour thereafter we moved on to <placeName reg="Sharpsburg, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7014501">Sharpsburg</placeName>, a few miles further, and were posted on the hills south of this village. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> This town lies in a deep valley.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>On the <rs>East</rs> is a high mountain ridge, running nearly from North to South, and all about the town are very high, bald hills.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>You do not often see a more broken country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Our centre, commanded, I think by <persName n="Hill,,D.,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="default:Hill,D.,H.,,"><foreName>D.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Hill</surname></persName>, rested on the village; our right, under <persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>, at the base of the mountain, and our left, under <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Thos,,,:2"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, about a mile to the left of the town, the spectator facing the <rs>East</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>About <time value="2pm">2 P. M.</time> <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>, clouds of dust indicated the approach of the enemy, and before night some of his artillery had gotten into position, and several of the rifle sections of our battalion interchanged shots with him, but without much effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Night came on and all was quiet, and we lay by our pieces, expecting that to morrow the great struggle would begin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>But the sun arose in all his glory, and still no sound of war was heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The country about <placeName reg="Sharpsburg, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7014501">Sharpsburg</placeName> is exceedingly beautiful &mdash; the farm houses and farms in the best condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>As the day were on many thought there would be no fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The enemy were moving their forces to the right, and we once supposed that they would make the attack there and drive out our pickets at the base of the mountain and attempt to turn our flank.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>At <time value="4oclock">four o'clock</time>, while <persName n="Longstreet,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Generals</roleName> <surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>, D. H. <unclear><persName n="Hill,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="nearbymention:Hill,D.,H.,,"><surname>Hill</surname></persName></unclear> and <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName>, were observing the enemy from a point on the left of the town, near where our battalion was in position, large bodies of artillery and infantry were seen passing to our left through some low ground just in front of us, and beyond a stream which divided the <num value="2">two</num> armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>With our glasses we saw them very distinctly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>We were surprised at the number of ambulances that accompanied these troops It was about <time value="5oclock">five o'clock</time> before the whole force passed through this meadow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>As the train was often halted, I could not think it possible that the enemy would make an attack that evening especially as it would take him some time to get into position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Others were of a different opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Just to our left and front was a pine thicket, about <measure n="500yards" type="distance">five hundred yards distant</measure>, and the rear of the column of the enemy had hardly gotten behind it before very sharp picket firing began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>We had previously placed sharpshooters in this thicket, and so soon as the firing began others were put into it at a double-quick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>It was now nearly dark, but the picket firing increased greatly, so that <num value="2">two</num> howitzers were ordered from our battalion to hurry forward and support our pickets by shelling the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>In the meantime the enemy's battery of <num value="8">eight</num> guns, at which we had fired on Monday and part of to-day, opened upon our right flank, and the guns being <num value="20">20</num>-pound Parrot, splendidly managed, did some execution in the darkness, though <measure n="2000yards" type="distance">two thousand yards distant</measure>. In <orgName n="battery"><persName n="Parker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Parker,nomatch:0"><surname>Parker</surname></persName>'s battery</orgName>, <num value="2">two</num> horses were killed and <num value="1">one</num> man wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The <persName><foreName>Minnie</foreName></persName> balls from the woods whizzed above us, but no other damage was done The picks firing was maintained till <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time>, and indeed so often renewed during the night that it was difficult to sleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>It was now evident that the morrow would be a day of blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>As we lay down upon the field, and look up into the great sky, we could but blush for the wickedness of man. Oh, how calmly and reproachfully do the bright stars move on in their courses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>It was a beautiful night; and no man who lay upon that field, and realized the deep tragedy which was to be enacted on the morrow, could but be sad and thoughtful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The past was present as well as the future, and we scanned the <num value="3">three</num> together, and tried to learn wisdom from the study.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>We thought of dear ones far away, and were glad that they knew not of the trying hour that the setting stars were bringing rapidly on. At <num value="3">three</num> every man was at his post, and awaited in solemn silence the day-dawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>No sooner did the light break in the east, than the picket firing began, and increased in fury until about sunrise, when artillery and infantry together grapple in the terrible fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Heavy columns of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> infantry appear to our left and front in a thin skirt of woods, and our guns pour into them a deadly shower of shot and shell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Our infantry on the left were in line of battle and under cover of a small ridge and a cornfield, while sharpshooters were also in the cornfield itself, between our line of battle and the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>We also had artillery just in front of the thin woods through which the enemy advanced, and, as the distance was not more than <measure n="400yards" type="distance">four hundred yards</measure>, it must have done great execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>In about an hour, or perhaps less, the enemy brought up artillery in the thin skirt of woods, also, and opened upon the guns in their front so sharply that they had to be withdrawn.--It was then that they turned upon us both artillery and infantry, and the conflict was terrific.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>The <num value="8">eight</num>-gun battery mentioned before, far on our right, and free from attack from us indeed, out of range, opened with great effect, enfilading both our batteries and the whole line of infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>They got the range with the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shot, and kept it for <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>. But for this cross fire the fight would not have lasted <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>. <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, it seems, had compelled us to fight him where he could rake our whole line, and had thrown such a heavy force just at that point that it could not well be resisted; so that, after <measure n="4hours" type="date">four hours</measure> fighting, we fell back about <num value="600">600</num> or <measure n="800yards" type="distance">800 yards</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>A painful sight especially was the body of a rebel who had evidently died of his wounds, after lingering long enough at least to apply a handkerchief to his thigh himself, as a tourniquet to stop the bleeding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>His comrades were obliged to leave him, and our surgeons and men had so much else to do that they could not attend to him in time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/> It was the ground over which our troops had driven the enemy, but which they failed to hold; and it had since been jealously watched by both parties, each prohibiting the other from entering upon it, even to care for his wounded or to bury his dead, if the skirmishing sharpshooters of either could prevent it. Numerous shots were exchanged yesterday between them in this spirit, but to-day the rebel skirmishers had left ours sole occupants of the field, and we civilians even felt free and safe to wander over the entire battle-ground without restriction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>Away across the fields, for a mile within the enemy's battle line, our gallant soldiers had charged and chased the chivalry, but afterwards had been obliged to retire before the enemy's batteries, leaving their fallen comrades on the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>Every dead man's feet I saw were robbed of their shoes and there were instances of our heroic boys being stripped of their pantaloons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>Their arms and accoutrements were invariably taken, of course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>On the other hand &mdash; I record it with a sense of relief from disgust at my kind &mdash; the enemy's dead within our reach lay just as they fell, untouched, excepting as their names might be sought after on their clothes, or the buttons might be cut off by the soldiers for trophies or remembrances of the field.--<name n="God" type="God">God</name> only knows what some of our poor men have suffered before they died.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>Such inflation of prices such a reckless scramble for money such immense transactions in gold, many of which are unreported; such general activity in every department of financial affairs, <address><street n="Wall street">Wall street</street></address> has not seen in many a long day.--The transactions were larger than any since last <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>, and the excitement was much greater than <unclear></unclear> The whole <unclear> ing</unclear> however, is to be found in the rise in gold.--That caused the depression in <rs n="real estate" type="product">real estate</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>That caused the advance in stocks, which was in fact only apparent, and which is not an increase in the value of the stocks, but only a mode of balancing the new difference between paper and specie incident to the rise in the price of gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>But what caused the rise in gold?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>A dozen different causes, all working together and assisting each other. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/> In the first place, there was the <rs>President</rs>'s emancipation proclamation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>Then the secret revolutionary meetings of the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> Governors, culminating in the conclave at <placeName key="tgn,7015966" n="1.000 12" reg="altoona, blair, pennsylvania">Altoona</placeName>, which we reported yesterday, had something to do with it. The pause of <orgName n="army"><persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00135" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> on the <rs>Potomac</rs> helped it along.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>The nomination of <persName n="Wadsworth,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00136" reg="mostcommon:Wadsworth,nomatch:0"><surname>Wadsworth</surname></persName> &mdash; a radical disunionist &mdash; had its weight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>The knowledge that there are at least <num value="2">two</num> members of the <rs>Cabinet</rs> who are practically in favor of disunion, and zealously working for that object, did not lack its influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>All these and other similar facts, supporting and corroborating each other, led the lame ducks of <address><street n="Wall street">Wall street</street></address> to fear that we could find no escape from our present dilemma except in an unexpected prolongation of the war for years instead of months or in a speedy and permanent dissolution of this Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>In the midst of this gloomy distrust, <persName n="Cisco,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00137" reg="mostcommon:Cisco,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Cisco</surname></persName>'s offer to receive gold on deposit for the <rs>Government</rs> at <num value="0.04">four per cent.</num> interest, frightened our bankers, and the fluttering began. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/> We do not see why this excitement will not continue, and gold &mdash; and consequently stocks &mdash; rise still higher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>The causes remain the same, and what should alter the result?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/><persName n="Cisco,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00138" reg="mostcommon:Cisco,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Cisco</surname></persName> must obtain gold in order to pay the specie interest upon Government paper; and, whether he receives gold on deposit or goes into the market and buys it outright, the rise in gold will ensue all the same.--Neither will it be possible for him to refuse any deposits over <num value="6000000">six millions</num>; for upon such a refusal the gold already deposited with him would be immediately withdrawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>Thus the occasion of the excitement must remain, and behind the occasion lie the causes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>Evidently Wall, street does not believe the assertions of the radicals that the war will be over in <measure n="30days" type="date">thirty days</measure> that <persName n="Greeley,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00139" reg="nearbymention:Greeley,Horace,,,"><surname>Greeley</surname></persName>'s <num value="900000">nine hundred thousand</num> reserve of abolitionists will enlist, and that the highways of <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> will swarm with <persName n="Andrew,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00140" reg="mostcommon:Andrew,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Andrew</surname></persName>'s promised recruits, in consequence of the <rs>President</rs>'s emancipation proclamation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/><address><street n="Wall street">Wall street</street></address> is practical, and cannot rely upon prophecies and predictions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>Neither does it fail to see that the revolutionary Governors are obstructing recruiting, delaying the draft, and holding back soldiers already enlisted, because of some foul conspiracy and diabolical intrigue, which has already borne fruit in crippling <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00141" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, by depriving him of reinforcements and as <sic>istance,</sic> and which may result either in a dishonorable peace or an unnecessary prolongation of the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/> <address><street n="Wall street">Wall street</street></address> cannot understand and does not like these secret clubs of war committees, these mysterious movements of Governors, these occult sessions at <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7015966" n="1.000 12" reg="altoona, blair, pennsylvania">Altoona</placeName>, this inexplicable retention in the <rs>Cabinet</rs> of <num value="2">two</num> practical disunionist, this renewed interference with <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00142" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, this radical bullying of the <name>Administration</name>, this scheme of giving a large independent corps or the chief command of our armies to a man like <persName n="Frement,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00143" reg="mostcommon:Frement,nomatch:0"><surname>Frement</surname></persName>, who is <unclear>edious</unclear> to all true soldiers, who is a general, but never won a battle, and who is distinguished only for repeated insubordinations and the reckless exhibition of that domineering spirit which has made many a better man a dictator, and which may make him <num value="1">one</num> If he but has the opportunities proposed to be afforded him. To <address><street n="Wall street">Wall street</street></address>, as to us all, these things bode trouble, and the consequence is a feverish excitement and a rapid rise in the pulse of the street &mdash; the golds <unclear>le </unclear> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/> Whether the <rs>Government</rs> has any remedy ready to cure this fever, or whether <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00144" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> cares to cure it by dismissing his obnoxious Cabinet and reorganizing it upon a conservative basis, we cannot say. It can be cure, however, by an earnest canvas of this and all other States in favor of conservative candidates for Congress, and by replacing the fanatics who now disgrace that body by men pledged to uphold the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the <rs>Union</rs> against all attacks, whether from the secessionists of the <rs>South</rs> or the radical disunion abolitionists of the <rs>North</rs>. </p> </q><bibl n="New York Herald,"></bibl></cit> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>The subject presented in the memorial is <num value="1">one</num> upon which I have thought much for weeks past, and I may even say for months.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>I am approached with the most opposite opinions and advice, and that by religious men, who are equally certain that they represent the <name>Divine</name> will I am sure that either the <num value="1">one</num> or the other class is mistaken in that belief, and perhaps, in some respects, both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>I hope it will not be irreverent for me to say that, if it is probable that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> would reveal His will to others on a point so connected with my duty, it might be supposed He would reveal it directly to me; for, unless I am more deceived in myself than I often am, it is my earnest desire to know the will of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> in this matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>And if I can learn what it is I will do it. These are not, however, the days of miracles, and I suppose it will be granted that I am not to expect a direct revelation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>I must study the plain, physical facts of the case, ascertain what is possible, and learn what appears to be wise and right. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="3"> 
<head>Differences of opinion on the subject.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/> The subject is difficult, and good men do not agree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>For instance, the other day <num value="4">four</num> gentlemen of standing and intelligence from New York called, as a delegation, on business connected with the war; but before leaving <num value="2">two</num> of them earnestly beset me to proclaim general emancipation, upon which the other <num value="2">two</num> immediately attacked them.--You know, also, that the last session of Congress had a divided majority of anti-slavery men, yet they could not unite on this policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>And the same is true of the religions people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>Why, the rebel soldiers are praying with a great deal more earnestness, I fear, than our own troops, and expecting <name n="God" type="God">God</name> to favor their side; for <num value="1">one</num> of our soldiers, who had been taken prisoner, told <persName n="Wilson,Senator,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00181" reg="nearbymention:Wilson,George,,,"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName> a few days since, that he met with nothing so discouraging as the evident sincerity of those he was among in their prayers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>But we will talk over the merits of the case. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="4"> 
<head>Why an emancipation proclamation should not be issued.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/> What good would a proclamation of emancipation from me do, especially as we are now situated?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>I do not want to issue a document that the whole world will see must necessarily be inoperative, like the <rs>Pope</rs>'s ball against the comet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>Would my word free the slaves, when I cannot even enforce the <rs>Constitution</rs> in the rebel States?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>Is there a single court, or magistrate, or individual that would be influenced by it there?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>And what reason is there to think it would have any greater effect upon the slaves than the late law of Congress, which I approved, and which offers protection and freedom to the slaves of rebel masters who come within our lines?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>Yes I cannot learn that law has caused a single slave to come over to us. And suppose they could be induced, by a proclamation of freedom from me, to throw themselves upon us, what should we do with them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>How can we feel and care for such a multitude?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/><persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00182" reg="nearbymention:Butler,J.,G.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName> wrote me, a few days since that he was issuing more rations to the slaves who have rushed to him than to all the white troops under his command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>They eat, and that is all; though it is true <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00183" reg="nearbymention:Butler,J.,G.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName> is feeding the whites also by the <num value="1000">thousands</num>, for it nearly amounts to a famine there. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="5"> 
<head>What is to prevent the rebels from Enslaving the <name>Negroes</name> again?</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/> If, now, the pressure of the war should call off our forces from New Orleans to defend some other point, what is to prevent the masters from reducing the blacks to slavery again? --for I am told that whenever the rebels take any blacks a prisoners, free or slaves, they immediately auction them off. They did so with those they took from a boat that was aground on the <placeName key="tgn,2715022" n="1.000 335" reg="tennessee river, united states, north and central america">Tennessee river</placeName> a few days ago. </p> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/> And then I am very ungenerously attacked for it. For instance, when, after the late battles at and near <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>, an expedition went out from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> under a flag of truce to bury the dead and bring in the wounded, and the rebels seized the blacks who went along to help, and sent them into slavery, <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00185" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName> said in his paper that the <rs>Government</rs> would probably do nothing about it. What could I do? </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="7"> 
<head>What good would an emancipation proclamation do?</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/> Now, then tell me, if you please what possible </p> <milestone unit="column" n="7"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/> result of good would follow the <unclear></unclear> of such a proclamation as you desire?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>Understand, I raise no objection against it on legal or <unclear></unclear> grounds; for, as <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs> of the army and navy, in time of war I suppose I have a right to take any measure which may best <unclear></unclear> the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>Nor do I urge objections of a moral nature, in view of possible consequences of <unclear></unclear> and massacre at the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>I view the matter as a practical war measure, to be decided upon according to the advantages or disadvantages it <unclear></unclear> offer to the suppression of the rebellion. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="8"> 
<head>The reply of the <name>Delegation</name>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/> Thus invited, your delegation very willingly made reply to the following effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>It being understood that a portion of the remarks were intermingled by the way of conversation with those of the <rs>President</rs> just given: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/> We observed (taking up the <rs>President</rs>'s ideas in order) that good man indeed differed in their opinions on this subject, nevertheless the truth was somewhere, and it was a matter of solemn moment for him to ascertain it; that we had not been so wanting in respect alike to ourselves and to him as to come a <measure n="1000miles" type="distance">thousand miles</measure> to bring merely our opinion to be set over against the opinion of other partial that the memorial contained facts principles and arguments, which appealed to the intelligence of the <rs>President</rs> and to his faith in <name n="God" type="God">Divine Providence</name>; that he could <unclear></unclear> that the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> denounced oppression as <num value="1">one</num> of the highest of crimes, and threatened Divine judgment against nations that practice it; that our country had been exceedingly guilty in this respect, both at the <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>; that our just punishment has come by a slaveholders rebellion; that the virus of secession is found wherever the virus of slavery extends and no further; so that there is the amplest reason for expecting to avert Divine judgments by putting away the sin, and for hoping to remedy the national troubles by striking at their cause. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/> We observed, further, that we <unclear></unclear> the probability, and even the certainty, that <name n="God" type="God">God</name> would reveal the path of duty to the <rs>President</rs>, as well as to others; provided he sought to learn it in the appointed way; but as, according to his own remark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/><placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> wrought by means and not miraculously, it might be <name n="God" type="God">God</name> would use the suggestions and arguments of other minds to secure that result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>We felt the deepest personal interest in the matter as of national concern, and by communicating the convictions of the <rs>Christian</rs> community from which we came, with the ground upon which they were based. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/> That it was true he could not now enforce the <rs>Constitution</rs> at the <rs>South</rs>; but we should see in that fact no reason whatever for not proclaiming emancipation, but rather the contrary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>The <num value="2">two</num> appealed to different classes; the latter would aid and, in truth, was necessary, to re- establish the former and the <num value="2">two</num> could be made operative together, as fast as our armies fought their way southward; while we had yet to hear that he proposed to abandon the <rs>Constitution</rs> because of the present difficulty of enforcing it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/> As to the inability of Congress to agree on this policy at the late session, it was quite possible, in view of subsequent events, there might be more unanimity at another meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>The members have met their constituents, and learned of marvelous conversions to the wisdom of emancipation, especially since late reverses have awakened thought as to the extreme peril of the nation, and made bad men as well as good men realize that we have to deal with <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in this master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>Men of the most opposite previous views were now uniting in calling for this measure. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/> That to proclaim emancipation would secure the sympathy of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> and the whole civilized world, which now saw no other reason for the strife than national pride and ambition, an unwillingness to abridge our domain and power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>No other step would be so potent to prevent foreign intervention. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/> Further, more, it would send a thrill through the entire <rs>North</rs>, firing every patriotic heart, giving the people a glorious principle for which to suffer and to fight, and assuring them that the work was to be so thoroughly done as to leave our country free forever from danger and disgrace in this quarter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/> We added that, when the proclamation should become widely known (as the law of Congress has not been) it would withdraw the slaves from the rebels, leaving them without laborers, and giving us both laborers and soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>That the difficulty experienced by <persName n="Butler,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00186" reg="nearbymention:Butler,J.,G.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName> and other <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> arose from the fact that half-way measures could never avail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>It is the inherent vice of half-way measures that they create as many difficulties as they remove.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>It is folly merely to receive and feed the slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>They should be welcomed and fed, and then, according to <persName n="Paul,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00187" reg="mostcommon:Paul,nomatch:0"><surname>Paul</surname></persName>'s doctrine, that they who eat must work, be made to labor and to fight for their liberty and ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>With such a policy the blacks would be no encumbrance, and their rations no waste.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>In this respect we should follow the ancient maxim and learn of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>What the rebels most fear is what we should be most prompt to do, and what they most fear is evident from the hot haste with which, on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day of the present session of the rebel Congress, bills were introduced threatening terrible vengeance if we used the black; in the war. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/> I admit that slavery is the root of the rebellion or at least its <hi rend="italics">sine qua non.</hi> The ambition of politicians may have instigated them to act, but the would have been impotent without slavery as the instrument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>I will also concede that emancipation would help us in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and convince them the we are incited by something more than ambition I grant further that it would help somewhat at <unclear></unclear> North, though not so much, I fear, as you and those you represent imagine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>Still, some additional strength would be added in that way to the war. And then unquestionably it would weaken <unclear></unclear> rebels by drawing off their laborers, which is great importance.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government has at last laid aside all disguise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00194" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> openly proclaims the abolition of slavery throughout the entire <rs>South</rs>, wherever a slave is held.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>The time for issuing this proclamation has been singularly well chosen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>It is when the discharge of <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00195" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName>'s last officer has left our Government, for the present, entirely without the means of retaliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>That document was not sent forth until <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00198" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> had assured himself that the <hi rend="italics">cartel</hi> either had been or would be signed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/> For the proclamation itself, it does not in the least alter the character of the war. It has been an abolition contest from the beginning, and is no more an abolition contest now than it was at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have stolen and set free all the negroes who were willing to go, wherever their soldiers have had possession of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>It is best for us, indeed, that the mask should be entirely laid aside, since our people, no longer deluded into the belief that their slave property will be respected, will be careful hereafter to remove it beyond the reach of danger.--This document is merely curious, from the clear demonstration which it affords, of the entire possession which the <orgName n="Abolition party" type="party">abolition party</orgName> has taken of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, and the utter prostration of the last remnant of what used with so much unction to be termed by the canting knaves of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> <q>&#x0022;the bulwark of our liberties&#x0022;</q> --we mean that ridiculous old <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, which no party ever paid any attention to when they were strong enough to disregard it, and from which no party too weak to justify its position with the sword ever received the slightest protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>That the whole <rs>North</rs> will acquiesce in this last kick at the expiring Constitution, cannot be doubted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>Experience has proved that we have nothing to hope from any party in that quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>Eager as they may be to cut each others throats, they are still more eager to cut ours, and to that pious work, we may be assured, they will devote themselves with all their energy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>They are already calling for a <num value="1000000">million</num> more of men, and the probability is that they will have them long before <persName n="Christmas,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00199" reg="mostcommon:Christmas,nomatch:0"><surname>Christmas</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>If only as many as <num value="5000">five thousand</num> of the stragglers who left their colors and lingered behind had been present, <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00205" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s rout would have been irremediable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/> --The <hi rend="italics">Continental Magazine</hi> open with a timely article on the late Henry Thomas Buckle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="815"/>It is short and well written, and the writer gives us interesting sketches of Buckle's life and death, but apparently knows him only through his works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="816"/>We make a few extracts: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="817"/> <persName n="Buckle,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00544" reg="mostcommon:Buckle,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buckle</surname></persName> never married.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="818"/>After he had commenced his great work he found no time to enjoy society, no hours of leisure and repose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/>His whole soul was engaged in the accomplishment of <num value="1">one</num> great purpose, and nothing which failed to contribute directly to the object nearest his heart received a moment's consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>He collected around him a library of <num value="22000">twenty-two thousand</num> volumes, all choice standard works, in <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName>, latin, Spanish, <persName n="French,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00545" reg="mostcommon:French,nomatch:0"><surname>French</surname></persName>, <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs>, <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italian</rs> and <persName n="English,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00546" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>, with all of which languages he was familiar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/>It was the best private collection of books, said some <num value="1">one</num>, in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/>It was from this that the historian drew that inexhaustible array of facts, and procured the countless illustrations with which the <num value="2">two</num> volumes of his History of Civilization abound. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/> <persName n="Buckle,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00547" reg="mostcommon:Buckle,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buckle</surname></persName> was a fatalist in every sense of the word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/>Marriages, deaths, births, crime &mdash; all regulated by law. The moral status of a community is illustrated by the number of depredations committed, and their character.--Following the suggestions of <persName n="Quitelot,,M.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00548" reg="default:Quitelot,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Quitelot</surname></persName>, he brings forward an array of ligures to prove that not only, in a large community is there about the same number of crimes committed each year, but their character is similar, and even the instruments employed in committing them are nearly the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/>Of course, outside circumstances modify this slightly &mdash; such as financial failures, scarcity of bread, &#x0026;c.; but by a comparison of long periods of time, these influences recur with perfect regularity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="826"/> As already remarked, he did not write to immortalize a hero, but to establish an idea; did not labor to please the fancy, but to reach the understanding; hence we read his books, not as we do the brilliant productions of <persName n="Macaulay,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00549" reg="mostcommon:Macaulay,nomatch:0"><surname>Macaulay</surname></persName>, the smooth narratives of <persName n="Prescott,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00550" reg="mostcommon:Prescott,nomatch:0"><surname>Prescott</surname></persName>, or the dramatic pages of <persName n="Bancroft,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00551" reg="mostcommon:Bancroft,nomatch:0"><surname>Bancroft</surname></persName>; but his thoughts are so well connected, and so systematically arranged, that to read a single page is to insure a close study of the whole volume.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="827"/>We would not study him for his style, for although fair, it is not pleasing; we cannot glide over his pages in thoughtless ease; but then, at the close of almost every paragraph, <num value="1">one</num> must pause and think. </p> </q><bibl n="The Continental Magazine"></bibl></cit> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
