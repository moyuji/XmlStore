<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>This shelling was heavier yesterday morning than on any previous day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> It is much to be regretted that some of our own men, prisoners in <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="nearbymention:Butler,F.,L.,D.,"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>'s hands, may be hurt by our own fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>He has now at hard labor in the canal, and exposed our fire, <num value="86">eighty-six</num> of the last prisoners he took from us; among whom is <persName n="Henley,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Henley,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Henley</surname></persName>, formerly commandant of the <orgName type="regiment" key="3VABattalion">Third Virginia battalion</orgName>, <persName n="Butler,,F.,L.,D.," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="default:Butler,F.,L.,D.,"><foreName>F.</foreName> <foreName>L.</foreName> <foreName>D.</foreName> <surname>Butler</surname></persName> says his treatment of these men is in retaliation for our having put a number of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> negro prisoners to work on <placeName key="tgn,7014404" n="1.000 6" reg="petersburg, petersburg, virginia">Fort Gilmer</placeName>, which alleged fact he says he learns from deserters from our army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>There is no truth in the statements of these deserters; indeed, it has been long known that deserters never tell the truth; they invariably concoct some story to make themselves acceptable to the party to whom they go. The real facts about the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> negroes we learn to be these: At the time of the <rs n="Battle of Darbytown" type="battle">battle of Darbytown</rs>, there were upwards of a <num value="100">hundred</num> of them imprisoned in <placeName reg="Castle Thunder">Castle Thunder</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>All the white prisoners in the castle volunteered to go to the front, and the negroes proposed that they should also be taken out and allowed to work on the fortifications, saying they would vastly prefer the out of door work to idleness in prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Their proposition was acceded to, and they were, for a day or <num value="2">two</num>, put to digging trenches <hi rend="italics">near the city.</hi> At no time during the very short period during which they were at work were they under fire or even within range of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>This is the whole story; and that <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="nearbymention:Butler,F.,L.,D.,"><surname>Butler</surname></persName> should pretend to retaliate for this, by exposing prisoners in his hands to the fire of our batteries at <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> gap, is but another evidence of his wanton cruelty and brutality. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> It will be seen in the extracts from Northern papers (published elsewhere in these columns) that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> declare their attack last Thursday on our lines, between the <rs type="place">Darby</rs> and <address><street n="Charles City road">Charles City roads</street></address>, to have been nothing more than a reconnaissance in force to ascertain what we were doing in that quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>We knew, and predicted, they would attempt to put this character upon the affair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>It is quite amusing to witness the elaborate efforts of the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> correspondent to make it out a reconnaissance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>He, however, does not explain to our satisfaction what manner of a reconnaissance it is, when the reconnoitering party makes, between <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time> in the morning and <num value="4">four</num> in the afternoon, <num value="5">five</num> determined assaults upon <num value="1">one</num> point of the enemy's lines, being each time repulsed with heavy loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The truth of the matter is, that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> determined to drive us from a new line of works, which we had just constructed, running from <placeName key="tgn,7014404" n="1.000 6" reg="petersburg, petersburg, virginia">Fort Gilmer</placeName> northwardly towards the <placeName reg="Charles City, Charles City, Virginia" key="tgn,2111055">Charles City</placeName> road, and last Thursday they undertook the work, and though they strove desperately, both whites and negroes, they were defeated and driven off, &#x0022;leaving,&#x0022; as <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Custis,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> said in his official report, &#x0022;many of their dead upon the field.&#x0022; If they had succeeded, it would have been &#x0022;a brilliant and successful attack&#x0022;; having failed, it is set down by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> as &#x0022;a reconnaissance in force, the objects of which were fully accomplished.&#x0022; </p> </div4>
