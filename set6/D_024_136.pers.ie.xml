<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> The long and gallant defence of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> is in its details yet but little understood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>When its situation shall be such as to enable us to communicate with its brave defenders we shall have a thrilling retrospective view of the heroic deeds of the long struggle to beat back the masses which were day after day thrown against its defences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>That it has been bravely defended all of us know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander in Chief</rs>, <persName n="Pemberton,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Pemberton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Pemberton</surname></persName>, has been as it were on trial; a trial of blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>He has been charged with incompetency, in efficiency, and a want of patriotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>He has certainly been unpopular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The people of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> were greatly dissatisfied when he was sent to command at that place, and it is supposed their remonstrances occasioned his removal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Yet those at <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> were reported to have been equally discontented with his assignment to the command there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>There was beyond question a great want of confidence in him. The trial which was to vindicate him or prove the correctness of the accusations against him has come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>It has been <num value="1">one</num> of the most terrible encounters with the enemy during the war &mdash; while it has been the most prolonged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>How <persName n="Pemberton,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Pemberton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Pemberton</surname></persName> has acquitted himself, the details alone can fully explain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>That he has fought bravely, however, there can be no doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>It should be gratifying, however, to the nation, which known so little of him, that a man who has cast his lot with us should prove himself not only true, but worthy of the post assigned him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> The history of the defence of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> will have an interest to every <num value="1">one</num>, whether it falls or not. The general belief of the nation how is that it will be successfully defended, and that the besieging forces of the enemy will be driven away after discomfiture and disaster not exceeded by any previous engagement with the <orgName n="Confederate Forces" type="org">Confederate forces</orgName>. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Especially was that of <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> last incredible in some respects and incomprehensible in others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>In so much has this been the case with reference to a matter so intensely interesting as that of the <rs n="Fall of Vicksburg" type="battle">siege of Vicksburg</rs>, that we have been driven to look for some explanation of our own messages to the lying dispatches of the enemy.--Our own editorial comments upon the subject are oftener based upon the confessions of the enemy of the state of the struggle for the reduction of our <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> <placeName reg="Gibraltar, Union, North Carolina" key="tgn,2348613">Gibraltar</placeName> than upon these muddy telegrams from <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Andrew,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>, etc, which are as muddy as the <rs>Mississippi</rs> itself.
