<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>He says that no doubt the occurrences of C&#x00E6;sar's day seemed to drag themselves along quite as tediously, although the conquests of C&#x00E6;sar are proverbial for their rapidity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>We read the commentaries, or the campaigns of <persName><foreName>Frederick</foreName></persName>, all in the bulk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>We do not go through the tedious details of military operations in the newspapers, catching the news of a moment <num value="1">one</num> day, and resting upon our information thus picked up for several others to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The newspapers, and the dispatches and bulletins of the generals, only let us see a little at a time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>A <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> campaign gathered this way, in detail, is wearisome enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>We must wait for the historian if we wish to read operations in the mass. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> In addition to other causes of uneasiness, the great anxiety necessarily felt by contemporaries &mdash; especially by that portion of them whose countrymen and friends are engaged in the conflict &mdash; renders delay still more painful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Every moment is protracted into an hour &mdash; every hour apparently grows into a week &mdash; weeks become years, and years seem expanded to ages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Every man who looks back to the beginning of a war in which he is immediately interested, and which has already lasted <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure>, without looking at the intermediate events, will feel that he is contemplating the events of yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>It is like looking across a tremendous precipice, directly to the other side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>He sees what is on the opposite cliff, but he sees nothing of the obstacles that lie between him and it. Let him look down, however, and he will find his brain reel and his eye sink.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Even so is it with the man who looks, not merely at the starting point of a bloody war, but at the incidents which lie between him and it.--When he breaks the great whole into separate parts, for analysis and contemplation, he becomes overwhelmed and stupefied with the scene. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> The events of this war have, no doubt, succeeded each other with sufficient rapidity, yet they are tedious to us, whatever they may be to the future historian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>It seems to us like an age since <persName n="Anderson,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName> was upturned at <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>; and when we read, the other day, that <persName n="Field,Mister,Dudley,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="default:Field,Dudley,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Dudley</foreName> <surname>Field</surname></persName> proposed to carry him back, and make him hoist his flag there again, we involuntarily asked whether he was still alive, or had not died of old age. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> <hi rend="italics">Fellow-Citizens,</hi>--The result of the &#x0022;<persName n="Commission,,Peace,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="default:Commission,Peace,,,"><foreName>Peace</foreName> <surname>Commission</surname></persName>&#x0022; is known to the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The hopes of those who have hitherto believed that an honorable termination might be put to the war by negotiation have been rudely disappointed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>The enemy, after drawing us into a conference, abruptly terminated it by insisting upon terms which they well knew we could never accept.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Our absolute surrender and submission to the will of the conqueror are the only conditions vouchsafed by our arrogant foe. We are told that if we will lay down our arms, and place our lives, liberty, property and domestic institutions at the fact of <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, that he will be merciful to us!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Upon his clemency we must rely to save us from universal confiscation and extermination!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Yes! these are the conditions upon which the people of the sovereign States composing the <rs>Confederacy</rs> may be allowed to do &mdash; what?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>To return into &#x0022;the <rs>Union</rs>&#x0022; from which they solemnly and deliberately withdrew themselves because their interest and their honor required it, and their repugnance to which <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> of remorseless and cruel war have served but to intensify!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Thanks be to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, who controls and overrules the counsels of men, the haughty insolence of our enemies, which they hoped would intimidate and break the spirit of our people, is producing the very contrary effect!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>From every part of the country there comes up in response a shout of mingled indignation and defiance! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/> A noble enthusiasm re-animates our gallant army, who have been battling so long for freedom and independence!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Let us all be united now. Let there be no parties or factions among us. Let us rise to the height of the great occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Let us all be willing to spend and be spent in the cause of our country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Let us contribute freely all that we have, if need be, to carry on the war until our final triumph is secured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Let us take fraternal counsel together, and calmly consider our condition and prospects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Such a survey, we believe, must tend to re-assure and encourage even the least sanguine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>We have, it is true, recently met with serious disasters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Our fortitude is being severely tried.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>We have suffered much, and must be prepared to suffer more, in the cause for which we are struggling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Is the cause worth the sacrifice?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>To answer correctly we must constantly keep in mind the end for which we are contending.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>What is our object in this war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>The establishment of our independence, through which alone are to be secured the sovereignty of the <name>States</name> and the right of self-government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>What is the alternative?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Our subjugation as a people!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Is it possible to over-estimate the horrors of this terrible alternative?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Can the imagination over-color the picture which would be presented in the event of our failure?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>If we fail, not only political degradation, but social humiliation must be our wretched lot. We would not only be political vassals, but social serfs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>An enemy that has shown himself destitute of the ordinary sensibilities of human nature, and whose worst passions are embittered and enflamed against us, would assume the absolute control of our political and social destinies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>In vain would a proud, though vanquished, people look even for that mercy which the conquered receive from a generous foe. Those &#x0022;State Rights&#x0022; which we have been taught to prize so dearly as the greatest bulwarks of Constitutional Liberty, and which, from the earliest period of our history, we have so jealously guarded, would be annihilated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> would be held as conquered provinces by the despotic Government at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>They would be kept in subjugation by the stern hand of military power, as <placeName key="tgn,7018159" n="1.000 10" reg="Venezia,Venezia,Veneto,Italia,Europe">Venetian</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7003237" n="1.000 6" reg="lombardy">Lombardy</placeName> have been held by <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName> &mdash; as <persName n="Poland,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Poland,nomatch:0"><surname>Poland</surname></persName> is held by the <rs>Russian Czar</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Not only would we be deprived of every political franchise dear to freemen, but socially we would be degraded to the level of slaves; if, indeed, the refinement of malice in our enemies did not induce them to elevate the negro slave above his former master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>Not only would the property and estates of vanquished &#x0022;rebels&#x0022; be confiscated, but they would be divided and distributed among our <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> bondsmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>But why pursue the hideous picture further?--Southern manhood revolts at the bare idea of the spectacle presented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Can you think of it unmoved?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>Can property &mdash; can life itself &mdash; be so dear to you as to allow you to weigh them for <num value="1">one</num> moment against degradation so abject &mdash; against misery so profound?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>We do not, and cannot, believe it. If the proud memories and traditions of our <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> great revolution do not nerve you to eternal resistance to such a consummation &mdash; nor the example of our forefathers, who wrestled for the independence they bequeathed us during <num value="7">seven</num> long years of suffering greater than we have endured &mdash; let not the precious blood that has been already shed by our bravest and best in the present struggle cry out to us from our yet reeking soil in vain!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>Fruitlessly, indeed, have these sons and brothers &mdash; martyrs of liberty &mdash; bled and died, if we falter now in the path which they have illumined before us!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/><milestone unit="column" n="4"/> In the <name>Revolution</name> of &#x0027;<num value="76">76</num> our armies and our people suffered far more than we have done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>Our cities then were almost all in the hands of the <rs>British</rs>, and we were entirely cut off from all supplies from abroad, while our facilities for producing them were infinitely less than they now are. <persName n="Greene,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="mostcommon:Greene,nomatch:0"><surname>Greene</surname></persName> tells us that the battle of <placeName key="tgn,7014152" n="1.000 7" reg="eutaw, greene, alabama">Eutaw</placeName> was won by men who had scarcely shoes to their feet or shirts to their backs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>They protected their shoulders from being galled by the bands of their cross-belts, by bunches of moss or tufts of grass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>A detachment marching to <persName n="Greene,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="mostcommon:Greene,nomatch:0"><surname>Greene</surname></persName>'s assistance passed through a region so swept by both armies that they were compelled to subsist on green peaches as their only diet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>There was scarcely any salt for <measure n="15months" type="date">fifteen months</measure>, and when obtained, it had to be used sparingly, mixed with hickory ashes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>We need but allude to the terrible winter which <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00030" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> passed at <placeName reg="Valley Forge, Shelby, Alabama" key="tgn,2742401">Valley Forge</placeName>, with an army unpaid, half starved and half naked, and shoeless, to convince us that much as our own brave soldiers are now enduring, their fathers, for a like cause, endured far more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/><placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> did not then despair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00031" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> does not now despair of the final triumph of a righteous cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>Why should we be doubtful &mdash; much less despondent &mdash; of our ultimate success? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/> The extent of our territory &mdash; the food-producing capacity of our soil &mdash; the amount and character of our population &mdash; are elements of strength which, carefully husbanded and wisely employed, are amply sufficient to insure our final triumph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>The passage of hostile armies through our country, though productive of cruel suffering to our people and great pecuniary loss, gives the enemy no permanent advantage or foot-hold. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/> To subjugate a country, its civil government must be suppressed by a continuing military force, or supplanted by another, to which the inhabitants yield a voluntary or enforced obedience.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>The passage of hostile armies through our territory cannot produce this result.--Permanent garrisons would have to be stationed at a sufficient number of points to strangle all civil government before it could be pretended, even by the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States Government</orgName> itself, that its authority was extended over these States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>How many garrisons would it require?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>How many <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> soldiers would suffice to suppress the civil governments of all the <name>States</name> of this Confederacy, and to establish over them, even in name and form, the authority of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>In a geographical point of view, therefore, it may be asserted that the conquest of these <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> is impracticable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/> If we consider the food-producing capacity of our soil we need feel no apprehensions as to our ability to feed the people and any army we may put into the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>It is needless to go into detail or adduce statistics in proof of this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>It is obvious to every well-informed mind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>Although the occupation by the enemy, and his ruthless policy of destroying the harvests, granaries and <rs n="agricultural implements" type="product">agricultural implements</rs> of our people, wherever he moves, has undoubtedly diminished the amount of our cereals; still, in view of the fact that in every State, without exception, its agricultural labor has been devoted almost exclusively to the raising of breadstuffs, while before the war it was mainly devoted to the production of cotton, tobacco and other exports, it is impossible to doubt that there is an ample supply of food in the country.--It is true that the deportation of our slaves by the enemy, and the barbarous policy of arming them against us,--a policy reprobated by all authorities on ethics or international law,--has considerably diminished our agricultural labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>But when we reflect that, in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, our exports &mdash; almost entirely the products of slave labor &mdash; amounted to (<measure n="250000000dollars" type="currency">$250,000,000</measure>) <num value="250000000">two hundred and fifty millions</num> of dollars, it may be safely assumed that our slaves, though reduced in numbers, are fully equal to the task of feeding both the population at home and the army in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>Our transportation, it is true, is defective and inadequate, but this may be infinitely improved by more energetic efforts and more thorough and systematic organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>We cannot believe, therefore, that on our bountiful soil, so richly blessed by nature, there is any danger of our failing in this great contest for want of food &mdash; of our being Starved into <sic>submisssion</sic> to the hateful yoke of the conqueror! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/> But if we look to the amount and character of our population, we see especial reason why we should be encouraged to hope for &mdash; nay, to be assured of &mdash; our ultimate success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>No people of our numbers can be subjugated, unless, false and recreant to themselves, their courage, faith and fortitude fail them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/> We have upon our rolls a very large army of veteran soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>It is true &mdash; and it is a sad truth to confess &mdash; that the number present for duty is terribly disproportion to the entire aggregate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>This is too notorious for concealment &mdash; and we have no desire to conceal anything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>We wish to speak frankly and truthfully to you of the actual condition of things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>The number of absentees from your armies has been a fruitful cause of disaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>On many a hard fought field the tide of success would have turned overwhelmingly in our favor had a&#x0022; been present whom duty required <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> to participate in the strife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>We will not stop to inquire into the causes of an evil which we have so much reason <unclear> plore.</unclear> The remedy is partly in the hands of Congress, and it is our province to apply it. But it is partly, also, in yours; and we appeal to you to use it. Let every good citizen frown down upon, and indignantly discountenance, all evasion of military duty &mdash; whether temporary or permanent &mdash; no matter how plausible the pretext or palliating the reason. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/> No duty, in this crisis of our affairs, can be more imperative than to fight for <num value="1">one</num>'s country, family and home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>Let no skulker, deserter, or absentee without leave, from the army, be tolerated in any community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>Let the reproachful glance of our women, between whose honor and the brutal foe our noble army stands as a flaming sword, drive him back to the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>With proper officers, strict discipline, and an elevated tone of public opinion throughout the country, desertion and absenteeism in the army can be arrested, and all men liable to military duty put into, and kept in, the ranks of our armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>If this be effected, we can maintain in the field a force sufficient to defy subjugation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/> But it is in the character of our population, especially, that we find those elements of strength which impress us with the conviction that we never can be conquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>Our people are peculiarly military in their characteristics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>Better soldiers than those in our army history has never shown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>They have endured extreme hardships and suffering with a fortitude, and fought against constant odds with a gallantry, that has earned the gratitude of their country and extorted the admiration of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>But, in addition to their military attributes, our people are pre-eminently of a proud and haughty spirit, and deeply imbued with the love of constitutional freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>It belongs to their race and lineage; and, as <persName n="Burke,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00032" reg="mostcommon:Burke,nomatch:0"><surname>Burke</surname></persName> long ago remarked, their relation to the servile race in contact with them has intensified the feeling and invested this love of liberty with a sentiment of personal privilege.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>To suppose that a people with such military, political and social characteristics will ever voluntarily submit to be ruled by any other government than <num value="1">one</num> of their own choice, is too insulting to their pride to be entertained for a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>And to doubt their capacity to achieve independence and maintain themselves as a separate Power among the nations of the earth, is to close our eyes to all the teachings of history &mdash; to ignore the proof which our own forefather have stamped upon its pages &mdash; to believe that human nature has changed, or that we are a degenerate race, unworthy descendants of our revolutionary sires! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/> The appointment by the <rs>President</rs> of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00033" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> as &#x0022;General-in-Chief&#x0022; has done much to restore confidence to the country and to reinspire the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>All feel that we may safely repose this weighty trust and responsibility in that great soldier and devoted patriot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>All feel that we may lean upon him as our tower of strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>All feel that his calm courage and stead fast purpose, his military skill and wise judgment, will enable him to wield our armies with the maximum efficiency and strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/><dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct> <name n="God" type="God">God</name> strengthen for the great task to which a confiding people have called him! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/> To provide means for carrying on the war, Congress has been compelled to impose upon the country a heavy burthen of taxation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>But, heavy as it is, it is not too heavy for the country to bear, and not heavier than our wants imperatively demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>It is impossible to maintain the mighty contest in which we are engaged without vast expenditures of money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>Money can only be raised by loans or by taxation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>Our condition does not enable us to effect the former.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>We must of necessity, therefore, resort to the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>We appeal to you with confidence to submit cheerfully to the burthens which the defence of your country, your homes and your liberties renders necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>To contribute according to his means to that defence is as much an obligation upon the citizen as it is to peril his life upon the battlefield. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/> Let us, then, fellow countrymen, tread the plain path of duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>No nation that has trod it faithfully and fearlessly ever, in the world's history, has stumbled and fallen. &#x0022;Nations,&#x0022; says <persName n="Burke,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="mostcommon:Burke,nomatch:0"><surname>Burke</surname></persName>, &#x0022;never are murdered &mdash; they commit suicide. &#x0022;--Let us not be guilty of the folly and the crime of self-destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>Let us show the fortitude, endurance and courage that belong to our race, and neither the brute force of our enemy's arms, nor the subtle poison of his lips, can extinguish the life of this Confederacy, breathed into it by the sovereign States which created it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/> The people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> are becoming weary of this war. The foreign material for their armies is beginning to fail them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>The mutterings of discontent at the prospect of a further draft upon their home population are beginning to be heard in their great cities.--The prospect of war, indefinitely prolonged, is alarming their capitalists.--Public credit must, sooner or later, collapse under the burthen of expenditures, the magnitude of which the most skillful financier cannot venture to predict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>The debt of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> is already equal to the national debt of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, which has been accumulating <milestone unit="column" n="6"/> since the revolution of <dateStruct value="1688--"><year reg="1688">1688</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>The interest on this debt is <num value="0.06">six per cent</num>, while the interest on the <rs>English</rs> debt is only <num value="0.03">three per cent.</num> It has been composed that the interest on the debt of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, together with the amount necessary to carry on its Government (even were the war at an and), would not fall much short of <hi rend="italics"><num value="500000000">five hundred millions</num> per annum!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/></hi>--a sum affirmed to be greater than the entire annual wealth of the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>While a people, in self-defence, may submit cheerfully to any privations and sufferings &mdash; to any sacrifices of treasure and of blood &mdash; there is a limit beyond which a country, waging a war of aggression and conquest, will not go. We cannot stop this war without degradation, ruin, dishonor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>Our enemies can have peace at any time by abandoning their wicked attempt at our subjugation, and allowing us to govern ourselves in accordance with those great principles for which their fathers and ours fought side by side. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/> Considered, therefore, in every point of view, it is impossible to believe that the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> will ever incur subjugation, or accept submission as the result of the great struggle in which we are engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>Neither is it possible to believe that these States, compelled by long years of unjust and unconstitutional action towards them by the <rs>Northern States</rs> to withdraw from political union with them, can ever be tempted by any promises, or so- called &#x0022;guaranties,&#x0022; to again unite themselves with them under a common government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>Forced into this revolution by their faithless disregard of the obligations of the constitutional compact, and by the selfish and sectional legislation which they fastened upon us, what, in the course of this war, has occurred to change our opinion as to their character and purposes?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/>The barbarity and unrelenting ferocity which has characterized their conduct of it has excited the indignant wonder of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>Falsehood, duplicity and mean cunning marked their course in its inauguration &mdash; and, in its progress, every artifice of low diplomacy and persistent misrepresentation has been resorted to by them to lesson us in the estimation of mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>Our struggle for the right of self-government &mdash; which they themselves have always declared to be inalienable &mdash; has been held up to the world as a contest for the maintenance of <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slavery &mdash; a purely State institution, over which neither the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> Government nor the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>To prevent foreign nations from according to us that recognition to which we were entitled by public law, and even the very language of existing treaties &mdash; a recognition which they have themselves accorded to other countries on far more slender grounds &mdash; they have deliberately falsified accounts of military operations and our capacity and resources for continuing the contest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>A war which has been carried on for <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> with ever varying fortunes, their <rs type="role" reg="Minister">Minister</rs> of State has again and again assured foreign Powers could not possibly be waged by us for more than <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>. And, after all their insolent boasts of their power to crush us, they have been compelled to resort to foreign enlistments and the arming of our captured slaves in order to fill up the ranks of their armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>In spite of these practices &mdash; winked at, if not countenanced, by <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> Powers &mdash; they have practically confessed their inability to vanquish us in regular warfare by the inhuman policy of destroying the dwellings, the food and the <rs n="agricultural implements" type="product">agricultural implements</rs> of our non-combatant population; thus endeavoring, by the starvation of their wives and children, to break the indomitable spirit of our soldiers. </p>
