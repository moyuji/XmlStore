<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> It seems that <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName></hi> has called a convention of editors, and endeavored to impress upon them the importance of not publishing any news in relation to military movements, a preliminary step, probably, to a censorship of the <rs>Northern</rs> journals, and, possibly, a suppression of those which speak out too plainly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> As a general rule, the press of a country ought to abstain from publishing any intelligence which can give information to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>In the beginning of hostilities, it is obvious that journalists, unaccustomed to a state of war, may err in this respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Our own Southern press, at the outset, announced the arrival and departure of regiments from particular points, and other matters of general notoriety, which, no doubt, the enemy was fully apprised of by his numerous allies and spies within our own borders; but the practice has been judiciously given up, much to the secret disgruntlement of many, whose curiosity desired the information, and yet who, with charming consistency, rated the newspapers roundly for publishing military movements.--Even when people have something to do, fault-finding is a luxury which they manage to make time for; and, when they have nothing to do, it is their sole occupation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>However, the <rs>Southern</rs> press in general has learned to hold its tongue, and <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName></hi> is trying to teach the same lesson to the <rs>Northern</rs> journalists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>We doubt whether he will succeed, and, if he does, whether it will be of much service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>In the first place, it is a very difficult thing to get a Northern newspaper in the <rs>South</rs>; in the next, they are so full of falsehoods that no <num value="1">one</num> believes a word they say. We conceive that their publications in the beginning of the war were of real service to the <rs>Northern</rs> cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>No <num value="1">one</num> supposed that it was possible for man to invent so many and such adroit falsehoods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>We do not remember that they have told a single truth in regard to any important military movement, from the beginning of the war to the present moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The only <num value="1">one</num> we now recollect is a telegraphic dispatch published soon after <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName></hi> had reached a point in <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>, where he could have marched upon <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName> without any difficulty, and thus taken <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> in the rear, and gone pretty much where he pleased, that he had gone to <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName> to see his wife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>An announcement which of course everybody supposed was a blind to conceal an impetuous dash at <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName> or <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>, but which turned out to be true after all. But that truth was the fault of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>,</hi> and not of the press. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> In fact, it is a poor return to the <rs>Northern</rs> press, this military suggestion to hold their tongues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>If there are any men in the <rs>North</rs> under special obligations to the press of their section, it is the <rs>Northern</rs> military.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Every victory they have gained has been gained in their newspapers, and nowhere else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Who can count the achievements which these knights of the pen have attributed to the knights of the sword?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>How adroitly these newspapers, which published so much, covered up the ghastly number of their dead and wounded at <placeName reg="Rich Mountain, Randolph, West Virginia" key="tgn,2616904">Rich Mountain</placeName>, at <placeName key="tgn,2044460;tgn,2016605;tgn,2036878" n="0.136 000000.8181	placename;tgn,2044460;bethel, oxford, maine,Oxford,Maine,United States,North and Central America;0.091 000000.5454	placename;tgn,2016605;bethel, fairfield, connecticut,Fairfield,Connecticut,United States,North and Central America;0.045 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2036878;north newton, harvey, kansas,Harvey,Kansas,United States,North and Central America" reg="bethel, oxford, maine,Oxford,Maine,United States,North and Central America;bethel, fairfield, connecticut,Fairfield,Connecticut,United States,North and Central America;north newton, harvey, kansas,Harvey,Kansas,United States,North and Central America">Bethel</placeName>, at <placeName reg="Vienna, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2114749">Vienna</placeName>, at <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>, and even at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Who can tell to this day the number that has been slaughtered upon the decks of their vessels in their various attacks upon our land batteries?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Who more indebted than <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName></hi> to the <rs>Northern</rs> press, which has so trumpeted his successes, gained in <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName> by the most tremendous odds, that they have made a great man of him, and puffed him to the head of the army?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>No <num value="1">one</num> ought to understand better the value of an ingenious lie than the military leader who informs the world under his own hand that he lost only <num value="20">twenty</num> men in <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The inventive genius that was capable of such an achievement, has no reason to be jealous of the most fertile invention in the daily press.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>A grateful man ought not to kick ever the ladder that has failed him in the world. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>The immense export and import trade of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, the large number of travelers who have hither to visited the <rs>North</rs> for health, pleasure, and, above all, business; the great amount of correspondence which will result from the commercial and individual revolution now taking place, will amply suffice to furnish a very profitable support to several lines of steamships plying directly between the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, and more particularly <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>The result is, on <num value="1">one</num> hand, that it may safety be affirmed that these line of steamers will no longer obtain remunerative freights, and that any new line between <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> and New York would not only fail to pay, but would not actually be able to sustain itself; while, on the other hand, direct intercourse with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> offers to steam and sailing vessels a free, wide, and almost unlimited field. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/> &#x0022;A vigorous prosecution of the war means its prosecution upon the plans and theories of the party in power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/>If the democratic leaders choose thus to renounce their principles, it is not for us to complain; but we think we can speak for <num value="1000">thousands</num> of the people, both <rs n="Democrat" type="political">democrats</rs> and conservatives, of other associations hitherto, who have no idea of stultifying themselves by such a line of action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>The public mind is assuming an independent tone upon the war question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>Men are becoming quite regardless of the attempt to dragoon them into submission to the dictation of party leaders, and strongly inclined to act upon their own judgment on questions involving the happiness and rights of <num value="30000000">thirty millions</num> of people, and the stability and security of property in all sections of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/> It is, however, quite proper that the fact should be proclaimed now, at the very threshold of these political schemes, that such a movement and such a policy, however it may command the approval of political leaders, will be generally repudiated by the conservative men of the <rs>State</rs>, both now and at the polls.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="904"/> Let a civilian, then, make <num value="1">one</num> suggestion to those who hold in their hands the lives of our patriotic soldiers and the honor of their country's flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="905"/>His suggestion is this: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="906"/> The rebel army ought not to be attacked in its present position, for the simple reason that it now occupies, of all others which its engineers could select, the very spot in which it can be most conveniently and certainly surrounded, and ultimately captured. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="907"/> The rebel camp at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> is protected on <num value="3">three</num> sides by considerable streams, and on the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> side, though at some distance off, by mountain ranges, the passes of which are, of course, held by their forces. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="908"/> Thus, on the north side of their position is <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>, a name now familiar to every reader. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="909"/> On the south side of the <rs type="place">Junction</rs> is <placeName reg="Broad Run, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2195788">Broad Run</placeName>, a stream quite as large as <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="910"/> On the east side is the <placeName reg="Occoquan River, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2555112">Occoquan River</placeName>, formed by the confluence of <placeName reg="Broad Run, Loudoun, Virginia" key="tgn,2195788">Broad Run</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2229381" n="1.000 504" reg="cedar mountain, culpeper, virginia">Cedar Run</placeName>, and receiving <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName> as a tributary. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="911"/> Now, between these <num value="3">three</num> streams, and thus protected by them on <num value="3">three</num> sides, is the rebel Army &mdash; well entrenched, doubtless, and with entrenchments protected by appropriate advanced works. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="912"/> The distance from <placeName reg="Manassas, Manassas, Virginia" key="tgn,2112877">Manassas Junction</placeName>, the centre of their position, out to either of these surrounding streams, is from <num value="2">two</num> to <measure n="4miles" type="distance">four miles</measure>. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="915"/> That time, however, will not arrive until a strong force shall have been sent down the <rs>Potomac</rs> from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, or brought up the <rs>Potomac</rs> by sea, and landed at the mouth of the <placeName key="tgn,2555112" n="1.000 15" reg="occoquan river, virginia, virginia">Occoquan</placeName>, within <measure n="10miles" type="distance">ten miles</measure> of the enemy's right flank, and at <placeName reg="Dumfries, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013623">Dumfries</placeName>, within <measure n="20miles" type="distance">twenty miles</measure> of the <orgName n="Orange and Alexandria Railroad" type="railroad">Orange and Alexandria Railroad</orgName>, the channel through which he procures all his supplies and reinforcements from the <rs>South</rs>. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="917"/> The conclusion at which I arrive, then, is that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> aim should be to render the <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> Capital secure, by adequately guarding the <rs>Potomac</rs>. </p>
