<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>Foreign Powers know the <name>Confederation</name> as an independent Power duly accredited; but they did not know that the <name>States</name> composing it were independent, because they had never demanded recognition as such, and they could not constitute themselves the interpreters of that Constitution which gave the <name>Confederation</name> a distained existence.
