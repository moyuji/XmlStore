<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> The rapid fulfillment of all the predictions of Democratic speakers and writers, as to what would take place in our beloved country in the event of a sectional triumph in the election of a President, need not be attributed to any gift of prophecy; it is the result of the <rs>Stern Logic</rs> of Events.--Poorly read in the history of Government, and a poor student of human nature, must he be who, in the face of the warfare which the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> party has been for years waging upon the institution of the <rs>South</rs>, could not have foretold the disruption of the <rs>Union</rs>, and the disasters that might attend that disruption. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> Now that we have entered upon civil war, let those who would read the story of the future appeal to that same <q>&#x0022;stern logic of events.&#x0022;</q> What does it teach?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>We speak by its instructions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> It teaches that, if <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> shall persist in attempting to carry out the policy indicated in his reply to the <rs>Virginia Commissioners</rs>, the <num value="15">fifteen</num> have States, numbering more than <num value="12000000">12,000,000</num> of people, will unite in a common cause of defending their firesides and homes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> It teaches that every man within their limits, capable of wielding a sword or leveling a rifle, will take the field, determined, like their revolutionary fathers of old, to repel the invader or die in the attempt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> It teaches that, sooner or later, the fate of every Northern army sent within their borders will inevitably be that which overtook those of the <rs>British</rs> tyrant which were landed on our coast to rivet on our forefathers the chains of slavery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> It teaches that the armies of the <rs>North</rs> may meet with occasional triumph; may burn a few cities and devastate a few fields; may rob the <rs>Southern</rs> mother and her tender children of their peaceful and quiet homes, may here and there incite servile insurrections; but successes like those will only provoke the wrath of Heaven, and raise up for the <rs>South</rs> <q>&#x0022;armies to fight their battles for them.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> It teaches that at last, after <num value="1">one</num>, <num value="3">three</num>, <num value="7">seven</num>, or <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> shall have passed away; after our armies shall have vanished before the never-failing aim of the <rs>Southern</rs> rifle, the irresistible charges of Southern cavalry, and the terrible ravages of a Southern climate; after myriads of Northern homes have been made desolate, and poverty and distress shall begin to stalk abroad in the streets of our cities and villages, then the hearts of our people will years for peace, and peace will come. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> It teaches that the independence of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> will be recognized, and that the <rs>North</rs> will be compelled at last to grant that which, in accordance with the spirit of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> liberty, it should promptly and cheerfully concede. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> Such are the teachings of the <q>&#x0022;Stern logic of events&#x0022;</q> We put them upon record, and invite all who read this article to remember predictions founded upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The authority of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> will never again be established within the limits of the seceded States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/> While we are disposed to give all the credit which it can possibly claim to the reported assertion of <persName n="Cameron,,Elmont,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00214" reg="default:Cameron,Elmont,,,"><foreName>Elmont</foreName> <surname>Cameron</surname></persName>, that the subject of mediation or intervention will be brought forward on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day of the approaching session of the <orgName n="British Parliament" type="parliament">British Parliament</orgName>, we nevertheless see grave reason to doubt in the assumption of the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> that <persName n="Lewis,Sir,G.,C.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00215" reg="default:Lewis,G.,C.,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>G.</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Lewis</surname></persName>, the <rs>War Secretary</rs>, spoke the mind of the <rs>Cabinet</rs> in the speech which we published last week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>It is true, the doctrine enunciated by him is directly opposed to the late practice of the <rs>British Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>That Government adopted the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> policy of recognizing the <rs>Government</rs> <hi rend="italics">de facto</hi> of every country with which it had diplomatic intercourse very early after it was introduced here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>True, it had not adopted it at the instant the most important opportunity it ever had to do so &mdash; we mean the case of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> French Republic, which it refused to recognise &mdash; presented itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>But the terrible consequences of that neglect &mdash; a war running, with but <measure n="15months" type="date">fifteen months</measure> intermission, through <measure n="23years" type="date">twenty-three years</measure>, and a debt of a <num value="1000">thousand</num> <num value="1000000">million</num> sterling &mdash; taught it wisdom, and it hastened to recognize the <name>Republics</name> of <placeName reg="South America" key="tgn,1000002">South America</placeName>, the <rs>Grecian</rs> communities, and <placeName key="tgn,1000063" n="1.000 67" reg="belgie">Belgium</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>Nevertheless, the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> has been generally understood to represent the opinions of the masses and to be in the habit of ascertaining pretty accurately, before speaking out upon any important question, what that opinion may be. The <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> has spoken of us, of late, in the most flattering terms, but has constantly sustained the ministerial policy of absolute neutrality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/><persName n="Lewis,Secretary,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00216" reg="nearbymention:Lewis,G.,C.,,"><roleName n="Secretary">Secretary</roleName> <surname>Lewis</surname></persName> himself, and every member of the <rs>Cabinet</rs> who has been heard from, except <persName n="Gladstone,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00217" reg="mostcommon:Gladstone,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gladstone</surname></persName>, speak very much the same language.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>For the <rs>English</rs> people, there can be no doubt that their feelings are all in our favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>But is it not possible that the views of the majority may coincide with those of the <hi rend="italics">Times,</hi> and of the members of the <rs>Cabinet</rs> alluded to?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>Is it not possible that the views of the latter may even take their <unclear></unclear> from the popular sentiment? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/> Looking at the matter in this light, we feel it our duty to caution the public against indulging in any extravagant hopes of immediate recognition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>That the question may be brought up at the opening of the session we think probable enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>It has even been said that Parliament has been called together earlier than usual for the purpose of presenting it. This it is true, would seem to indicate that the <name>Ministry</name> is disposed to consider our claim to recognition Favorably.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>Nevertheless it is by no means decisive of the question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>It must be recollected that we have often been deceived in speculations upon this subject, and that there is no better reason now for expecting recognition than there was a year ago. The policy of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> upon the matter is entirely selfish, and perhaps is necessarily so. Yes to every person on this side of the <rs>Atlantic</rs> it appears obviously mistaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>There cannot be a plainer proposition than that the subjugation of this Confederacy, and its reunion with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> States, would prove eventually highly disastrous to <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>The world has never beheld such armaments, such resources, and such fighting, as this contest has brought out on both sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>The armies of the <rs>Holy Alliance</rs> and of <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00218" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> sink into insignificance beside them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>Now Yankeedom is bitterly exasperated against <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, and could she subdue us, and become the possessor of our resources in addition to her own, would take the very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> opportunity to make war on her. How that war would end is, we think, not in the least doubtful, and it will not appear so to any man who looks at what has been lately done here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>In the first place, <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> would lose <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>Her fleets would next be swept from the ocean.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>Next, all the rest of her colonial possessions &mdash; the <placeName reg="West Indies" key="tgn,7004550">West Indies</placeName>, <placeName reg="Australia" key="tgn,7000490">Australia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Bharat" key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName>--would assuredly follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>Next, again, she would inevitably lose <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName>, and, lastly, she would find her own soll invaded by a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men. No man will think those recurrences at all improbable who reflects that the old <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> was wont to double its population in <measure n="23years" type="date">twenty-three years</measure>, and that, if these States ever become reunited, they will in <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure>--a mere <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> in the life time of a nation &mdash; be inhabited by <num value="100000000">100,000,000</num> of just such people as <unclear></unclear> new waging this unheard of war. It is, therefore, so plainly the interest of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> to keep the <num value="2">two</num> sections separate, that every thinking, man on this side of the water has wondered that, from the prompting of mere selfishness--<unclear>con </unclear> that she acts upon none other than selfish principles &mdash; she has permitted the war to assume sues gigantic proportions, and the parties engaged in it to ascertain the secret of their terrible strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>Let she has pursued this blind policy, in opposition to her own recorded practice heretofore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>Is it possible, then, to be sure that any inducement can prevail upon her to adopt a different line of policy to that she is now pursuing?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>This the greatest of all probably involving her very existence as a nation, has <unclear></unclear>. What other can succeed? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/> It certainly would be a very pleasant thing to be recognized by the ruling Powers of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>It would, on many accounts, too, be of essential service to us. If we had the fleet of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, or <num value="1">one</num> like it, we could put an end to the war at short notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>Not <num value="1">one</num> of the marauding scoundrels now infesting our country could escape death or capture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>But still, it is our duty to impress upon the public the important truth that such assistance is by no means absolutely essential.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>We both can and <hi rend="italics">will</hi> work out our own salvation, through great trials and tribulation it may be, but certainly and triumphantly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>The enemy never will, and never can, subdue us. The very <unclear></unclear> and privations our soldiers endure without murmuring is a guarantee of the fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>While, therefore, we do not say that intervention will not come, we <hi rend="italics">do</hi> say that we ought to act as though it were an impossible occurrence. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/> Few of us, while seated around our own fires in winter well supplied with comfortable clothing, can realize the situation of those who are exposed to the inclemency of the weather, without sufficient covering, without change of apparel, or with tattered and unclean underclothing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/> The inability in an army to procure necessary washing makes it imperative that they should be furnished with a larger supply of clothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>The loss of clothing &mdash; which is inevitable to those who are making long and hurried marches &mdash; renders it proper that they should be supplied more frequently than the army regulations allow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>The articles of shoes and stockings are most needed, because the wear and tear upon them from frequent and rough usage is incessant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>Shoes especially have become so exorbitantly high that the pay of the soldier is not sufficient to enable him to procure them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>From such causes, and from inattention on the part of subordinate officers, the men are too frequently unprovided with these indispensable requisites.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>Who can see the soldiers of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> marching with naked feet, in weather such as we have lately experienced, without feeling his cheek flushing with sensations of shame and mortification?
