<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> The train stopped, the axles screeched, the whistle shrieked, and the engine sent out side puffs of spiteful steam, and on the platform <unclear></unclear> a little old lady with a big new handbox in that state of mingled confusion and excitement common to old ladies from the country a prospect of a journey, particularly a journey after that incantation of <placeName key="tgn,2000536" n="1.000 4" reg="warren, illinois">Young America</placeName> a locomotive. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> &#x0022;Good-by, mother!&#x0022; said a mild-looking, dark eyed woman giving the old lady a kiss. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> &#x0022;Good-by, grammar&#x0022; shouted a thick set boy from his station beside the engine, which be was surveying, much as if he had taken an order to build <num value="1">one</num>, and meant to improve on this pattern. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> &#x0022;Oh, dear me!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>where's my bundle?--no, my handbox!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>I declare if I hain't got it in my hand after all!--Good-by, Sary!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> &#x0022;Here it is, mother; now get in,&#x0022; answered an elderly man who stood at her elbow. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> &#x0022;All aboard!&#x0022; again roared the conductor; and the old lady made for the car with <persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName> after her, holding in his hand the basket of apples, with a piece of string knotted to the handle, a bunch of dry fennel, and a blue cotton umbrella.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/><persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName> could get no farther than the door, for the cars began to move.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>He piled the things upon the old lady's handbox, and swung himself off, just in time to get upon the end of the platform, leaving his mother in law a picture of confusion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> However, the old lady righted herself pretty quickly; she tied her fennel to <num value="1">one</num> end of the string, took the umbrella in <num value="1">one</num> hand and the handbox in the other, hung the bucket on the umbrella handle, which she held horizontally, and proceeded to find a seat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>There were none empty, but several occupied by only <num value="1">one</num> woman; and guided by the instinct of dress that almost all women possess, she stopped beside <num value="1">one</num> of these whose occupant's peculiar array stamped her as a country woman, and have been familiar aspect to our heroine. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> &#x0022;Can I set here?&#x0022; said the old lady, giving a little poke to the woman's elbow, who looked round with the forbidding expression common to single or solitary females when assaulted by that question in the cars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>But as soon as she caught sight of her questioner's face within the frill of her black bonnet she smiled a benignant smile of welcome, and said, in a loud, cheerful voice. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> &#x0022;Why, 'tain't you, <persName n="Dodd,Miss,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="nearbymention:Dodd,Jehiel,,,"><roleName n="Miss">Miss</roleName> <surname>Dodd</surname></persName>, is it?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> &#x0022;Well, I declare!&#x0022; said the old lady, who recognized a neighbor from the town next her own; I <hi rend="italics">am</hi> beat now!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> &#x0022;Why, I come away this morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>But set down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>I'm real glad it's you; I never do fellowship strange folks settin' in the same seat with me on the railroad; seems so intimate like, and they most always crowd.&#x0022; </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> &#x0022;Good gracious!&#x0022; said she, darting a sharp look at <persName n="Dodd,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Dodd,Jehiel,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Dodd</surname></persName>, who was holding on to the seat pretty well frightened. &#x0022;Good gracious!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>I don't see what folks do want to carry each things for! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> &#x0022;Dear me!&#x0022; said the old lady, &#x0022;it is too bad, I do say!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>But what on airth jounced all these <unclear></unclear> so?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>I do believe we've run away!&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> &#x0022;Well,&#x0022; was <persName n="Packard,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Packard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Packard</surname></persName>'s indignant reply, &#x0022;I guess if we had, you wouldn't be a <unclear></unclear> about it!&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> &#x0022;Don't you want some rum onto your head?&#x0022; said <persName n="Dodd,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="nearbymention:Dodd,Jehiel,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Dodd</surname></persName>, anxious to repair the injuries her apples had committed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/> &#x0022;I guess I had better have some,&#x0022; was the mollified reply, evidently expecting the old lady to hand over the lotion from her handbox in her pocket.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>But she innocently answered. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/> &#x0022;I wonder if the conductor hain't got any, I should think he'd keep some in case of <unclear></unclear> and cuts.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> An indignant sniff was the sole remark <persName n="Packard,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Packard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Packard</surname></persName> hazarded; and the old lady, after picking up her apples, which had rolled hither and <unclear></unclear> through the car, quietly established herself in the seat beside her friend, who was occupied in pinching up and pulling out the <unclear></unclear> bonnet and its decorations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Just as handbox, umbrella, apples, and fennel were all finally arranged, the conductor came by. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> &#x0022;Picket, Ma'am!&#x0022; </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> &#x0022;Dew tell!&#x0022; said the old lady, in an accent of horror, &#x0022;wasn't a red cow?&#x0022; </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/> &#x0022;Pretty red when I see her,&#x0022; grimly remarked he. </p>

<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/> &#x0022;I guess I sha'nt ask you to pay for this ride,&#x0022; said he, smiling. &#x0022;You can get a ticket for New York at the <rs type="place">Springfield office</rs>, and the down train starts in <measure n="5minutes" type="date">five minutes</measure>, right along-side t'other side of the waiting room; you won't have any stop to make there.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/> Pretty soon the train did stop, and the old lady bundled out, and after much questioning and explanation discovered a ticket-office, and in her fresh confusion asked for and bought a ticket to <placeName reg="Albany, Albany, New York" key="tgn,7013266">Albany</placeName>, and deposited herself in the train for <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/> It was some time before the cars began to move, and <persName n="Dodd,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00041" reg="nearbymention:Dodd,Jehiel,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Dodd</surname></persName> thought her friendly conductor must have mistaken the time, so she left her box and walked forward to an elderly man who sat reading a paper just before her, and said. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/> &#x0022;I thought these here cars wan't goin' to wait very long.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/> &#x0022;Time changed,&#x0022; gruffly replied he. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/> So <persName n="Dodd,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00042" reg="nearbymention:Dodd,Jehiel,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Dodd</surname></persName> eat down again, and in a few minutes the same <num value="2">two</num> women, who had been before her on the <rs>Springfield</rs> train, came in and took the same seat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/><persName n="Dodd,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00043" reg="nearbymention:Dodd,Jehiel,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Dodd</surname></persName> was hardly pleased by this encounter, and it puzzled her somewhat that these <num value="2">two</num> ladies who had just come up should be going down again; but she said nothing, and in <measure n="10minutes" type="date">ten minutes</measure> the train was off. It was an express train, and stopped at but few places, so that she was well on her journey before the conductor claimed her ticket, which was safe at the bottom of her pocket. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/> &#x0027;I'll get it in a minute,&#x0027; said she, deprecatingly, as the conductor began to look impatiently at the heterogeneous articles that <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num> were being fished up out of her pocket. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/> &#x0027;Hurry up, Ma'am!&#x0027; said he, at length, crossly. &#x0027;I can't wait all day!&#x0027; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/> So urged, the poor old lady thrust her hand energetically <unclear></unclear> deeper yet, and ran a sharp pin from the pin-ball into her thumb; her hand was withdrawn with as much force as it went in, and her elbow hit the basket of apples, which, for the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> time that day, went rolling along the floor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>This last catastrophe was too much for poor <persName n="Dodd,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00044" reg="nearbymention:Dodd,Jehiel,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Dodd</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>She was tired, and puzzled, and hungry, withal; she had no dinner, and had brought nothing to eat with her; and tears of fatigue as well as vexation dimmed her spectacles as she tried to inspect the wounded thumb. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/> &#x0027;I'll get your ticket when I come back,&#x0027; said the conductor, tired of waiting. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/> But the old lady scarcely heard him &mdash; she could not see the place that was hurt on her thumb; which she was most anxious to do &mdash; and in her simplicity she quite forgot that the ladies in front of her had been rude in the morning; so, quite regardless of her apples, she lifted herself half-way off the seat, and leaning forward, thrust her hand between the <num value="2">two</num> ladies, and asked, in perfect good faith. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/> &#x0027;Say, Ma'am!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>can you see the hole?&#x0027; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/> The lady on the right turned round and looked at <persName n="Dodd,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00045" reg="nearbymention:Dodd,Jehiel,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Dodd</surname></persName> with a pair of eyes that expression made more insolent even than nature had made them, and said in the <unclear></unclear> voice of ice and snow, tingling with a fine suggestion of astonishment-- </p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/> <persName n="Dodd,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00046" reg="nearbymention:Dodd,Jehiel,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Dodd</surname></persName> never winced she was so absorbed in her hurt. &#x0027;Why, you see I sticked a pin into my thumb, and pins are plenteous, they say. <persName n="Smith,,Hester,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00047" reg="default:Smith,Hester,,,"><foreName>Hester</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>'s daughter, <unclear></unclear> worked to a pin factory, she got pricked and didn't take no pains to heal up the wound, and she swelled up awfully, got mortified and really died; so I always carry Daily in my pocket to put on <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> jump; but I can't see real well in the cards as to apply it right.--Do you see the hole?&#x0027; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/> The green eyes and amber hair confronted her again, and the same discriminating voice remarked, &#x0027;I see a very dirty thumb.&#x0027; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/> Now <persName n="Dodd,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00048" reg="nearbymention:Dodd,Jehiel,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Dodd</surname></persName>'s thumb did not look clean; she had taken off her clinging silk gloves to straighten out her bonnet and pick up her apples, and the dust had left no mistakable traces on that pluckered and pierced member.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>But <persName n="Dodd,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00049" reg="nearbymention:Dodd,Jehiel,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Dodd</surname></persName>'s hobby was cleanliness; she was scrupulously, religiously neat; however old, and faded, and stained her dress might be it was always faultlessly clean as soap and water could make it; and to have a strange woman in a public conveyance tell her that her thumb was &#x0027;dirty&#x0027; was not to be endured. --She bent her head slightly to facilitate the manoeuvre and directed a look over her spectacles at the offender, a look of that transfixing kind peculiar to indignant old ladies, in which they assume something of the severely virtuous aspect common to those dragon flies that have <num value="4">four</num> eyes, though they do not wear spectacles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>But the green eyes and amber hair were turned away, and poor <persName n="Dodd,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00050" reg="nearbymention:Dodd,Jehiel,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Dodd</surname></persName>'s Medusae artillery was wasted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/> &#x0027;I wish you better manners!&#x0027; </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/> No notice was taken of this little remark by the green eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>An icicle could not have been more insensitive, and <persName n="Dodd,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00051" reg="nearbymention:Dodd,Jehiel,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Dodd</surname></persName> had spent all her ammunition; so, after anointing her whole thumb with her favorite remedy, and tying it up in a rag extracted from that voluminous pocket &mdash; which certainly was clean!--she betook herself to gathering up the scattered apples &mdash; a work of time and patience, for they had rolled further than ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>Just as she was fairly settled again the conductor came back for her ticket, which she had discovered, and taken the precaution to pin to her shawl.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>She handed it up to him with a look of serene satisfaction. </p>

<head>To the people of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Northwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/> <hi rend="smallcaps">Fellow Citizens.</hi>--The present war has now reached a stage at which every candid mind must be convinced that it will soon result in the complete establishment of the separate independence of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>After <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> of war, in which the <rs>North</rs> has lost several <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> men, and spent more than a <num value="1000">thousand</num> <measure n="1000000dollars" type="currency">million dollars</measure>, the <rs>Confederacy</rs> remains unconquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>It is now more able to resist than it was in the beginning, comparing its strength with the power of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>It has larger and better armies, with more copious materials of war than it had a year ago. It still repulses early every advance of the enormous levies of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>It has already displayed more strength and acquired more glory than other countries which have been independent for ages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>If its achievements have been attended with large expenditures of blood and treasure, yet the capacity of such a people as ours to carry on war can never be exhausted while the war is to resist subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>On the contrary, the <rs>North</rs>, which fights for conquest, must find its warlike resources practically exhausted whenever it become clear that conquest is impossible in a war waged by the <rs>North</rs> for the subjugation of the <rs>South</rs>, the failure of the <rs>North</rs> is the complete triumph of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>That triumph is at hand. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/> That result appears certain to us, who know the spirit and resources of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>Even you, who have been separated from the <rs>South</rs>, and have learned the events of the war mainly from Northern sources, must have corrected their boastful bulletins of victories by the confessed results of campaigns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>You know, for example, how many &#x0022;grand armies&#x0022; have been sent to take <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, and Low many victories they have claimed; but you have seen the same armies always return shattered, decimated, disgraced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>You know that <persName n="Richmond,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00326" reg="mostcommon:Richmond,nomatch:0"><surname>Richmond</surname></persName> remains undefiled by the foot of a conqueror. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/> We have met with some disasters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/>Others may befall us. They would not discourage us. Even if <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, or <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, or <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, or any other city were to fall, there would still remain to us between the <rs>Atlantic</rs> and the <rs type="place">Rio Grande</rs> a vast country and an unconquerable people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>Partial successes of the enemy, wherever obtained, must at length be abandoned by the remnants of invading armies, glad to escape from a country which they may ravage, but cannot subdue. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/> The <rs>North</rs> can never conquer the <rs>South--Neither</rs> will the <rs>South</rs> ever consent to a restoration of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/>An inhuman attempt to subjugate a brave, free, enlightened, <name>Christian</name> people can never be forgiven or forgotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/>The atrocities of the <rs>North</rs> in prosecuting the war, and a desperate attempt to invoke servile insurrection, have placed a fiery gulf of hatred between the <num value="2">two</num> countries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/>The separation, which was forced by fanaticism, has been confirmed by ferocious folly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/>It is not the <rs>South</rs> which will have to regret the consequences. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/> As certainly as the atrocious scheme of subjugation is destined to fall, just so certainly will every inch of the soil of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> remain under her jurisdiction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>The entire <rs>South</rs> will be conquered, or all <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> will be free.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/> During this war our new Government could not <unclear></unclear>keep large armies constantly in Northwestern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/><placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> without neglecting <unclear></unclear> points of defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>Vexatious raids have usually been avoided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>But our battles have been fought as well for the ultimate liberation of the <rs>Pan Handle</rs> as for the independence of all the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>Event may yet take a different course even in this war. Hereafter such preparations will be made that in future wars the brave and hardy men of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Northwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName>, backed by the most warlike nation on the globe, will more probably become invaders than victims of invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>They would be in greater danger on the <rs>Northern</rs> than they would be on the <rs>Southern</rs> side of the boundary. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/> We congratulate you upon the certainty that our section of the <rs>State</rs> will remain with <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> and with the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/>A large majority, we believe, will rejoice in this assurance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>Your interests are with the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>In the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, our section of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, so full of all natural elements of wealth, will become <num value="1">one</num> of the most prosperous regions of the continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>With the <rs>North</rs> it would dwindle under the shadow of rival and stronger sections. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/> In the <rs>South</rs> we have maintained free institutions throughout this tremendous struggle, while the <rs>Government</rs> has needed the largest powers, and the people would have acquiesced in many stretches of authority in order to defend their political existence, their property, their families and their lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>We have thus proved that liberty may flourish among us for ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/>The <rs>North</rs>, merely for the hope of enslaving us, has given up, <num value="1">one</num> after another, the most sacred safeguards of constitutional freedom, and has shown itself incompetent to preserve free institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>You will be glad to enjoy liberty with the <rs>South</rs> rather than endure despotism with the <rs>North</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/> When this unequal struggle began, it might have been expected that the borders of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 7" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, and especially the <rs>Northwest</rs>, would, for a time, be overflowed by the armed populations of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>It was not to have been expected that a civilized nation would brutalize war by such barbarities as you have suffered and witnessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/>It is hardly credible that any among you would have made themselves agents of the invaders to oppress their fellow-citizens by setting up a petty Government under the protection of foreign bayonets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>We do not address ourselves to those who have eagerly engaged with the enemy to subjugate or to dismember our venerable Commonwealth.--They have chosen to abide the event of a war in which they have taken the part of traitors, and they must abide it. To those among you, who, rather than betray the <rs>State</rs>, have suffered oppression from usurpers and invaders with martyr-like constancy, we tender the tribute of our cordial sympathy and profound admiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>They deserve to be ranked with those other citizens of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Northwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName>, who, on every battle field of the <rs>State</rs>, from <placeName reg="Great Bethel">Great Bethel</placeName> to <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>, have fought with heroic courage in the cause of liberty. --These gallant men, and those who great home, have boldly maintained the right of the people of the <rs>Northwest</rs> to wear the illustrious name of <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginians</rs> in spite of the treason which some have committed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/> If you have not all acted with equal firmness, we are gratified to believe (as we have many reasons for believing) that a large majority of the citizens of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Northwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName> have cherished a loyal attachment to the <rs>State</rs>, and that they abhor treason and traitors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>We know how to make due allowance for the cruel necessities of your situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/>While some of us were able to retire to places where we could serve the cause of the <rs>South</rs>, and several <num value="1000">thousand</num> have joined our armies, it is just to remember that a whole community so great as ours could not withdraw into the interior; nor could they alone resist the powerful States on their borders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>Many were hampered by poverty, or charged with the care of families, or detained at home by other obstacles which could not be overcome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>Being compelled to remain, their submission could be enforced by arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>Mere submission to irresistible force will not be imputed to them as a crime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>Voluntary and corrupt complicity with treason can never be excused by any circumstances. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="798"/> We are proud to know that a large majority of the people in <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Northwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName> have always refused to vote at the elections ordered by the usurped Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="799"/>Situated as you have been, it was the most effectual protest you could offer against that capitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="800"/>We advise you to persevere in that course, unless, upon some special occasion, you can deliver a united and affective vote which cannot be construed as a friendly recognition of usurped authority; as, for example, to protest against a dismemberment of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/>Without inciting you to rash and vain resistance to overwhelming force, we advice you to make a manly avowal of your loyalty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/>We invite all the young men who can to unite with the renowned armies of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>No man should willingly <unclear></unclear> so great a duty at the defence of his country's independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/>No man of spirit can be a careless spectator of the meat remarkable straggle for constitutional freedom in all time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/>In future ages it will be the boast of the proudest in the lead that they are descended from the heroes of this war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/> We <unclear></unclear> you all, young and old, to cherish the sentiment of loyalty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/>Encourage <num value="1">one</num> another, Suffer with fortitude what you have to suffer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/>He vigilant, resolute, and hold when your opportunity comes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/>Rest assured that </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/>
