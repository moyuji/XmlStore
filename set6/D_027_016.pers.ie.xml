<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>It is now clear to all that this movement could have been easily prevented, and the humiliation consequent upon it avoided, had the men who hold the reins of power been endowed with the least amount of sagacity and foresight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>But to our great surprise nothing of the kind occurred.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/> The cause of that inaction, which was then so surprising to us all, was, I have been informed, produced by a desire to attract the <rs>Union</rs> army as far south as possible, so as to uncover the northern frontier, which, by this means, was to be eft accessible to an inroad of the rebel forces.--In the estimation of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00054" reg="mostcommon:Lee,S.,D.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, the concentration of all the available forces of the <rs>North</rs> on the south of the <rs>James</rs>, far from being dangerous to the rebel cause, was <num value="1">one</num> of the luckiest events of the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>There are a number of reasons alleged for this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>Most of these militiamen are unused to the service, have never had any experience in the tented field, and do not seem to understand as well as the more experienced members the nature of the call and the situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>They hesitate, and ask if they will be relieved from the draft in consequence of their obeying the call, how long they are expected to serve, and whether they will be engaged in garrisoning the forts and works of defence or placed in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>The regimental commandants explain that they will probably be engaged in garrison duty; that the term of service will probably be short, but that it is not definitely known, and that the orders are positive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>At present the military situation is really not such as to enable the authorities to predicate any definite statement of the time the militia will be needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>The raid may practically end in <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure>; it may, in a more of less threatening form, exist for a <num value="100">hundred</num>; so that it would be deemed desirable to keep a strong force ready to act on the defensive in the vicinity of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> and <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>. </p> </q><bibl n="The world"></bibl></cit>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>These periodical raids are getting to be popularly disbelieved in, and the apparent apathy thus caused seems to be showing its effect upon the militia.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>Judging even from these, we perceive that it must have been completely successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>The invaders went where they pleased, stayed as long as they pleased, departed when they pleased, took away what they pleased, and destroyed what they pleased. --They carried off, for instance, or destroyed <num value="1000000">one million</num> of bushels of grain, all the horses worth carrying off, and as many cattle as they took a fancy to.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>Having stayed as long as it suited their convenience to stay, they drew off without interruption, apparently scarcely impeded in their retrograde movement, for we take the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> report of the capture of <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="300" type="prisoners">three hundred prisoners</measure> to be a <hi rend="italics">fancy</hi> of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> merely.
