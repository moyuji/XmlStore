<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Agreeably to your request, I handed to him a copy of the inaugural address of <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, and added that I was instructed by you to say to him that it embraced the views of the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> upon the difficulties which now disturb the harmony of the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName>, and also an exposition of the general policy which it was the purpose of the government to pursue with a view to the preservation of domestic peace and the maintenance of the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Here <persName n="Thouvenel,,M.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="default:Thouvenel,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Thouvenel</surname></persName> asked if there was not some diversity of opinion in the <rs>Cabinet</rs> of the <rs>President</rs> as to the proper mode of meeting the difficulties which now disturbed the relations of the <rs>Senators</rs> and General Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>I replied, upon that point I had no information.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Under our system the <rs>Cabinet</rs> was an advising body, as opinions were entitled to weight, but did not successfully compel the action of the <rs>President</rs> &mdash; the executive power was by the <rs>Constitution</rs> vested exclusively in the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>I said that I was further instructed to assure you that the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> entertains a full confidence in the speedy reconsideration of harmony and unity of the <rs>Government</rs> by a firm, yet just and liberal policy cooperating with the deliberate and loyal action of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/><persName n="Thouvenel,,M.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="default:Thouvenel,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Thouvenel</surname></persName> expressed his pleasure at the assurance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> I further said that the <rs>President</rs> regretted the events going on in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> might be productive of some possible inconvenience to the people and subjects of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, that he was determined that those inconvenience shall be made as light and transient as <unclear></unclear> and, so far as it may rest with him, that all strangers who may suffer any injury from them shall be indemnified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>I said to <unclear></unclear> that the <rs>President</rs> thought it not impossible to appeal would be made before long by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> to foreign Powers, and, against others, to the <rs>Government</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, as the recognition of their independence; that to such appeal having yet been made, it was premature and out of place to discuss any of the exports involved in that delicate and important inquiry; but the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> desired the fact to be known that whenever any such application shall be made to will meet with opposition from the <rs>Minister</rs> who shall then represent that Government at this Court.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>I said to him that permission at this Court would soon terminate, and I should have no official connection with the question which it was anticipated that arise upon the demand of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> for recognition of their independency that my place would soon be supplied by a distinguished citizen of the <placeName reg="New Jersey" key="tgn,7007565">State of New Jersey</placeName>, a gentleman who possessed the <unclear> </unclear> of the <rs>President</rs>, who fully sympathized in his public views, and who would <unclear> </unclear> come fully instructed as to the then <unclear></unclear> and views of the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and that the only request which I would now make, and which would <unclear></unclear> all I had to say in the interview, was that no proposition recognizing the permanent <unclear></unclear> of the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName> shall be considered by the <rs>French Government</rs> until after the arrival and reception of the new Minister accredited by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to this Court. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> <persName n="Thouvenel,,M.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="default:Thouvenel,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Thouvenel</surname></persName>, in reply, said that no application of yet been made to him by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> in any form for the recognition of their independence, that the <rs>French Government</rs> was not in the habit of acting hastily upon such questions, as might be seen by its earliness in recognizing the new kingdom of <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName>, that he believed the maintenance of the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName> in its integrity was to be desired for the benefit of the people of the <name>North</name> and <name>South</name>, as well as for the interest of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, and the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> might rest well assured that no nasty nor precipitate action would be taken on that subject by the <rs>Emperor</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>But whilst he gave appearance to these views, he was equally found to say that the practice and usage of the present century had fully established the right of <foreign lang="spa"><hi rend="italics">de facto</hi></foreign> Governments to recognition when a proper case was made out for the decision of foreign Powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Here the official interview ended. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> The conversation was then further protracted for an inquiry from <persName n="Thouvenel,,M.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="default:Thouvenel,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Thouvenel</surname></persName> when the new tariff would go into operation, and whether it was to be regarded as the settled policy of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>I told him that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day of the present month had been prescribed as the period when the new duties would take effect; that I had not yet examined the provisions with such care as would justify as in pronouncing an opinion upon its merits; that it was condemned by the commercial Masses of the country, and that I had no doubt, that the discontent manifested in several quarters, that the subject would engage the attention of Congress at its next meeting, and probably some important modifications would <unclear></unclear> it the finances of the <rs>Government</rs> were at this time temporarily embarrassed, and would no doubt the provisions of the new tariff were adopted with a view, although probably a mistaken <num value="1">one</num>, of sustaining the credit of the <name>Treasury</name> as much as reviving the protective policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>He then asked me my opinion as to the course of policy that would be adopted toward the seceding States, and whether I thought force would be employed to coerce them into submission to the <rs>Federal</rs> authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>I told him that I could only give him my individual opinion, and that I thought force would not be employed; that ours was a Government of public opinion, and although the <rs>Union</rs> unquestionably possessed all the ordinary powers necessary for its preservation; as had been shown in several partial reconstructions which had occurred in our history that the extreme power of the <rs>Government</rs> could only be used in accordance with public opinion, and that I was satisfied that the sentiment of the people was opposed to the employment of force against the seceding States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>So sincere was the deference felt at that country for the great principles of self government, and so great the respect for the front of the people when adopted, under the repressing forms of State organization and State sovereignty, that I did not think the employment of force would be tolerated for a continent and I thought the only solution of any difficulties would be found in such modifications of our constitutional compact as would invite the seceding States back into the <rs>Union</rs> of a peaceful acquiescence in the assertion of their claims to a separate sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>The battle-ground of this great conflict is to be upon <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> soil, and no precaution should be omitted which could contribute to the success of our Southern arms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/> It is not to be denied that <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> has been taken at great disadvantage in the sudden outbreak of the war. However plain to the vision of many of her citizens might have been the fact that war was imminently impending, yet the large majority of our people, and the public authorities, could not realize, and would not recognize, the danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>The consequence has been natural.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>The war has found us not fully provided with the munitions of war and the appointments of an army, and, what is much more important, without well digested military organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>The work of organization has had to be perfected exclusively by civilians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>We have a few officers of the late Federal army in the line, and <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> in the staff; but except the latter, the whole military administration and the whole operations of the staff are in the hands of civilians --in the hands of civilians who never saw service, never saw an enemy, and never conceived before of military organization in its scientific aspects, and in its essential importance to the efficiency of an army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/> In respect to this matter the <rs>Washington Government</rs> has had every advantage of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>It had possession of the most perfect military organization known to the science of war. It had the skeleton of an admirably constructed Army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>It had hundreds of skillful officers, reared to arms in <num value="1">one</num> of the best military schools in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>It had munitions of war in vast and inexhaustible profusion, and of every form and fashion of invention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>It had the support of the manufacturing section of the <rs>Union</rs>, embracing numerous private armories, superior in many respects to the best public armories of the most warlike powers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>It had still another advantage in the great mass of raw material for soldiers that the stoppage of business had thrown idle upon the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>It had, moreover, the prestige of the old national flag, and the sanction of constituted authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>In a world, it had every advantage over <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> save that of a good cause &mdash; a military organization already in operation, an army already matured in every arm and branch, boundless munitions already provided, arms in profusion, and capacities for multiplying them to infinity, and recruits by the half <num value="1000000">million</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/> With all these odds against her, and with all these disadvantages at the start, <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> has gone resolutely into the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>She has accomplished much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>She can now arm <num value="30000">thirty</num> to <num value="40000">forty thousand</num> men; and but for the want of <rs n="military equipments" type="product">military equipments</rs>, she could, in a fortnight, put <num value="75000">seventy-five thousand</num> of her own troops into the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>Her great need, however, is military organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>Her great desideratum is that thorough knowledge of all the details of their business, by the various civilians in charge of her military administration, which is so necessary to promptitude and success in her preparations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>You may have the plan of organization.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>The skeleton form may be perfect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>Every commission provided for in the plan may be in the possession of a good man; but if these men lack experience; if they are strangers to the details and routine of a business which must be learned as a trade; your military organization is precisely in the condition of a ship at sea, with a captain ignorant of navigation, with a mate for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time in his life out of the sight of land, and with a crew who never before saw the ocean, all sea-sick and home-sick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>This is by no means a just picture of the new military organization of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>; but we will say <sic>that that</sic> organization is in its infancy, that it is in <dateStruct value="-1-"><month reg="1">the first month</month></dateStruct> of its existence, and without the efficiency which time and experience confer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>We put an extreme case in order to show where the shoe pinches in our present operations, and to point out what is most needed by <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> at the present moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>We conceive that the presence of the military organization of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, of its able chief officers, of its ample financial resources, of its experience, power and authority, will supply to us precisely that which we now sorely need &mdash; almost the only thing that we do need.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>It is not men that we want.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>It is the arms and equipments which that Government has in supply; it is the discipline and organization that <sic>that</sic> Government can at once provide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>We need something more: we want the authority of <num value="1">one</num> able, competent, universally-trusted man. We have the raw material, we have the courage, we have the patriotic impulse, all in profusion; we crave only the magic wand of authority, to set all this material in motion, and to charm the whole mass into discipline, order and subordination to <num value="1">one</num> superior will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>We want <num value="1">one</num> commanding mind at the head, who will enjoy the absolute confidence of man and woman, and whose command every heart will leap to obey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>That is what we need in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> at this moment &mdash; the obtainment of which brings the supply of everything else besides. </p>

<head>Abuse of the <rs>South</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/> We must express our <sic>acknowldgments</sic> to the abolition editors who occasionally send us newspapers filled brimful of all manner of blackguardism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>and malignity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>We know they intend to annoy us, but we cannot afford to let them do it. The envy, hatred and detraction of low fellows has no especial terror for their superiors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>This world is made up of all sorts of people, and we are prepared to take them as we find them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>When we read newspapers full of such stuff as has been lately sent us, we look at the thing philosophically; we examine them as we would queer specimens of natural history, and amuse ourselves with conjecturing what such kind of beings were created for. The only conclusion we can come to is that of the <name>Scripture</name>-- some vessels for honor and some for dishonor.--These <q>&#x0022;lewd fellows of the baser sort&#x0022;</q> have their uses, no doubt, like spiders, lizards and copperheads, but it is a mystery which can only be explained at the last day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/> We assure the abolition editors that their abuse of the <rs>South</rs> is but so much mud, which only defiles him who throws it. None of it adheres to us. It is in general disagreeable to be made the subject of ribaldry, but the vocabulary of abuse has been long ago exhausted by the <orgName n="New York Tribune" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi></orgName>, and the dally repetition of the thing has deprived it of all novelty and effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>We have come to look upon these in odorous exhalations as an essential part of the nature of our vulgar enemies, and regard them as entirely a matter of course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>Their impelling motive is envy; they feel a consciousness of their innate inferiority in all the qualities that adorn humanity to the <rs>Southern</rs> people, and hence their excessive bitterness.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/> Such squads are to act as guerillas, and if the enemy approaches their section of the country, hang upon his outskirts, fill the hollows, hide behind trees, in ditches, anywhere that they can best protect themselves and cut down the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>Such men so armed and equipped, can destroy an enemy's army more certainly and effectively than regular troops, and any of the weapons we have named, in the hands of a cool, determined man, is sufficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>He is universally admitted to have been a most active, energetic and industrious official and his necessary relinquishment of this position is as generally regretted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>It was a miserable party spirit, combined with the ruinous and deceptive howl of <q>&#x0022;Union,&#x0022;</q> at a time when all men ought to have been actuated by an exclusive Southern sentiment, which was successful in ejecting him from an office, the duties of which he had discharged with the universal approbation and applause of the public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>Diabolism there is now rampant, but it will be met and resisted with the energy, determination and unwavering stability which pervade the souls of men fighting for their very social and political existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>He it is who is holding the ruins and guiding the movement, and He will bring the movement to its consummation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>It is no mere negro question; It involves the severance of as people whose sentiments and institutions are hostile to the growth in peace of each, and it is this philosophy, this theory, which is now evolving itself, and assuming an objective form.

Not only are all the young men found in its ranks, but it numbers, on its muster roll, <num value="24">twenty-four</num> married men and heads of families. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/> Some idea may be formed of the spirit of the people in the neighborhood from the statement of <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> facts: <num value="1">One</num> man (now dead) has <num value="1">one</num> son (the only <num value="1">one</num> young enough to serve,) and <num value="17">seventeen</num> grandsons among the volunteers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>Before the company marched he was prostrated by disease, and his mother has been left to watch alone by his bedside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/> At the risk of writing too much to be published these stirring times, I must add that the spirit of patriotism and resistance to tyranny is by no means confined in our county to those in she military service.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/> <q>&#x0022;Ha ! the very place !&#x0022;</q> So his wife carries the candle for him, and the valuable packet is deposited in this hidden receptacle.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/> Perhaps it was a restless night and unpleasant dreams which made the clerk so uneasy-- even in the next day's work &mdash; knowing that he had not visited the escritoire before leaving home in the morning to ascertain with his own eyes the safety of the papers in this charge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/>He pooh-poohs the idea as it presents itself, remembering that <num value="1">one</num> key is in his own possession, and the other on his wife's housekeeping bunch; but it returns so often, that it is with a feeling of relief that he hears the signal for closing, and feels he is at liberty to return home. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/> How is it his welcome is not such a smiling <num value="1">one</num> as usually is?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/><persName n="Fanny,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00355" reg="mostcommon:Fanny,nomatch:0"><surname>Fanny</surname></persName> seems to guess what is passing in his mind by her coming so softly to his side, and stroking his hair, and pressing her lips to his forehead; but neither of them say anything, and Mark leisurely prepares for his task of copying.--While he has gone up stairs to fetch his papers, she lights an extra candle, and ensconces herself in a corner with her work-table, regretting as she does so that her <q>&#x0022;poor boy&#x0022;</q> must be bored with this tedious writing when he ought to be resting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>However, Mark soon comes down the states, <num value="3">three</num> at a time, to ask, rather angrily, why she has moved his packet without mentioning it. With astonishment in her looks, his wife denies having done so, and hurries with him to the spare bedroom, asserting her belief that he has overlooked the parcel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>Not a thing is out of its place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>The old escritoire stands exactly as they left it, the lock had not been tampered with, nor was the secret drawer open; and there, undisturbed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>He the love letters; but the small brown paper parcel, tied with pink tape, and sealed with the office seal, is gone ! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/> The husband, suspecting he knows not what, looks almost sternly at his wife, whose answering glance is confused and full of terror. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/> <q>&#x0022;Tell me the truth, <persName n="Fanny,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00356" reg="mostcommon:Fanny,nomatch:0"><surname>Fanny</surname></persName>, my dear <persName><foreName>Fanny</foreName></persName> ! Are you playing a trick to tease me ? Remember, if I cannot produce these papers, I am a ruined man ! It would be worse than the loss of money; <hi rend="italics">that</hi> I might replace, these I cannot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>Tell me at once where they are.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/> <q>&#x0022;Indeed, Mark, I know no more about them than you do yourself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>They must be here; perhaps they have slipped behind the drawer.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/> Although next to impossible, the chance is not overlooked; hammer and chisel are soon fetched, and the back of the escritoire is knocked out, leaving no nook or cranny where the smallest paper could remain unperceived. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/> Almost beside himself, Mark leads his wife down stairs, and commences questioning her. Where is her key?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>On the ring; it has not been out of her possession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>Has she been out?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>No Is she quite sure of that?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/>Quite; besides, as she ventures to remind him, the locks have not been forced, or is aught else missing, as would have been the case if thieves had entered the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>In uncontrollable agitation, the be wildered young man paces the room, while <persName n="Fanny,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00357" reg="mostcommon:Fanny,nomatch:0"><surname>Fanny</surname></persName>, unable to proffer advice, or assist him with any reasonable conjecture, watches him in trembling silence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/> Suspicions are crowding upon his mind; hints given before his marriage about <persName n="Robert,,Fanny,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00358" reg="default:Robert,Fanny,,,"><foreName>Fanny</foreName> <surname>Robert</surname></persName>'s brother, and regrets uttered, even in his hearing, that a respectable young man like <persName n="Edwards,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00359" reg="nearbymention:Edwards,Mark,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Edwards</surname></persName> should lower himself by such a connection, are suddenly remembered and dwelt upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>He pauses before his wife, and sternly demands what errand had brought that brother of hers to his house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>That brother of hers ! What a speech ! All <persName n="Fanny,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00360" reg="mostcommon:Fanny,nomatch:0"><surname>Fanny</surname></persName>'s sisterly feelings are in arms, and yet her voice falters, for she is forced to own that it was the want of money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/><q>&#x0022;And you told him I had those papers in the house,&#x0022;</q> Mark cries accusingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>With a crimson face, she angrily denies it. She did not mention <persName><foreName>Mark</foreName></persName>'s affairs during their short interview.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>Is it likely she would do so?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/>Or if she did, would <persName><foreName>George</foreName></persName>, poor foolish fellow that he is, steal up stairs and rob his sister's home?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>Ridiculous ! Impossible ! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/> <q>&#x0022;Impossible,&#x0022;</q> Mark retorts, <q>&#x0022;without he possessed the key.&#x0022;</q> <q>&#x0022;It has not been out of my pocket,&#x0022;</q> sobs <persName n="Fanny,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00361" reg="mostcommon:Fanny,nomatch:0"><surname>Fanny</surname></persName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/> <q>&#x0022;Then where,&#x0022;</q> asks Mark, <q>&#x0022;are the missing papers?&#x0022;</q> Their little servant-maid away for a holiday &mdash; no <num value="1">one</num> in the house, according to <persName n="Fanny,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00362" reg="mostcommon:Fanny,nomatch:0"><surname>Fanny</surname></persName>'s own confession, but this young man. Where are the papers ! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/> Receiving for reply a torrent of tears and protestations, he flings himself on the sofa, and tries to steady his nerves to the consequences of this extraordinary loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>Meanwhile, <persName n="Fanny,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00363" reg="mostcommon:Fanny,nomatch:0"><surname>Fanny</surname></persName> goes and institutes an unavailing search in every box, and cupboard, and drawer where it could be possible to find such a parcel, although it would puzzle her to explain how it could have withdrawn itself from the secret drawer to take refuge elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>At last she returns to the parlor in despair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>The packet must have been stolen.--But how?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>When? By whom?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>Getting frightened at <persName><foreName>Mark</foreName></persName>'s gloomy looks, she is delighted when a tap at the door announces a visitor, and that visitor proves to be her father.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>To him the mysterious affair is circumstantially detailed, and Mark points out the inevitable loss of his situation and good name if he should be unable to produce the papers, or give any clue which might lead to their recovery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>To <persName n="Fanny,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00364" reg="mostcommon:Fanny,nomatch:0"><surname>Fanny</surname></persName>'s dismay be particularly dwells upon her brother's visit, and her half made endeavor to conceal it; concluding by an entreaty that she will, if retaining any affection for her husband, tell all she knows. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/> But now the father interposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>To tamely hear both his children accused of such a crime, is more than his rather irascible temper will endure, and he enters a counter-accusation that Mark has, for some unworthy end, removed the parcel himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>Words now become so hot and bitter that <persName n="Fanny,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00365" reg="mostcommon:Fanny,nomatch:0"><surname>Fanny</surname></persName>'s distress is increased, not lessened by this championship, and she weeps so bitterly, and pleads so earnestly with both, that Mark, more touched than he would like to confess, abruptly leaves them to shut himself in his chamber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>After some hours the sound of his footsteps ceasing, the anxious wife creeps softly up the stairs, and is relieved to find him lying on the bed in an uneasy slumber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>Her father persuades her to rest too, but poor <persName><foreName>Fanny</foreName></persName> shakes her head, and still sits by his side, leaning her head on his shoulder, and feeling more forlorn and miserable than it had ever been her lot to feel before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/>What will poor Mark do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>And what will become of her, if he persists in believing her guilty ? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/> Equally bewildered, and almost as unhappy as his daughter, <persName n="Roberts,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00366" reg="mostcommon:Roberts,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Roberts</surname></persName> tries to soothe </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/> In the modern <num value="6">six</num> roomed house every sound is distinctly audible, and they hear him enter the chamber where stands the now shattered escritoire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>After a short pause, he is heard slowly descending the stairs, and his wife raises herself from her reclining position, and smoothes her disordered hair. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/> As he enters the room, <persName n="Roberts,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00369" reg="mostcommon:Roberts,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Roberts</surname></persName> lays his hand on his daughter's arm. <q>&#x0022;Look, child, look !&#x0022;</q> he whispers; and <persName><foreName>Fanny</foreName></persName> sees with astonishment that her husband is fast asleep, and holds in <num value="1">one</num> hand the bundle of old love-letters. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/> Setting down his candle, Mark unlocks the front of his large and well-filled bookcase, and begins deliberately taking down, <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num>, the handsomely bound volumes of the <hi rend="italics">History of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>,</hi> which grace the highest shelf; then he draws out a number of loose magazines, hidden there because of their untidy appearance; lays the old love- letters quite at the back of all, replaces the odd numbers, returns the volumes to their shelf, carefully putting them even, locks the glass-doors, and is stalking away, when <persName n="Fanny,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00370" reg="mostcommon:Fanny,nomatch:0"><surname>Fanny</surname></persName>, with a cry which awakens him, snatches the key from his hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>Rubbing his eyes, and wondering, he sees her eager fingers dragging <persName n="Hume,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00371" reg="mostcommon:Hume,nomatch:0"><surname>Hume</surname></persName> and Smollet from their proud position to assume an inglorious <num value="1">one</num> on the hearth-rug and in the fender; the once treasured <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Assemblees,,Belle,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00372" reg="default:Assemblees,Belle,,,"><foreName>Belle</foreName> <surname>Assemblees</surname></persName> </hi> are scattered in all directions; the highly prized love-letters receive similar usage; and then, from behind all the rest, <persName n="Fanny,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00373" reg="mostcommon:Fanny,nomatch:0"><surname>Fanny</surname></persName> triumphantly takes out the small brown-paper parcel, tied with pink tape, and sealed with the office seal.
