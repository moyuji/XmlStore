<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>On the assembling of the troops for dress parade, and while a battery of beauteous eyes was directed to the stalwart forms of our brave soldiers, a sudden swaying of the crowd of spectators to and fro announced the occurrence of something unusual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Eager eyes scanned every direction, and those unable from their distance to ascertain the nature of the commotion, were pressing forward to see and learn, when all doubts and surmises were dissipated as some <num value="1">one</num> enthusiastically shouted, <q>&#x0022;<num value="3">Three</num> cheers for <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Davis,Sam,,,:1"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName>&#x0022;</q> Literally surrounded by the dense mass, through which, with difficulty, his prancing steeds forced a passage, our <rs type="role" reg="Chief Magistrate">Chief Magistrate</rs> was shaking hands and bowing to the eager aspirants for that honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Now the crowd becomes too dense, and the impatient steeds, as if conscious of their honored burden, halt in the midst of the applauding hosts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Few and patriotic were his words, and soul-thrilling when he urged the soldiers' duty in the great conflict before us. At the finale of the dress parade, the gallant and soldier-like companies, <q>&#x0022;F&#x0022;</q> of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, <q>&#x0022;B&#x0022;</q> of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, and the <q>&#x0022;Madison Infantry,&#x0022;</q> of <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, marched to the front of the parade-ground and halted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The peat uniforms and tasteful appearance of <orgName type="company" n="Company F">Company F</orgName>, the ease and facility with which they performed the intricacies of the manual, proclaimed at once the perfect soldier; while the host of fair friends, who were smiling approval at the almost perfect execution of each command, indicated their prowess in the boudoir and parlor as well as in the camp. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The fine physique of the members, the prompt executions of the evolutions incident to parade, elicited the admiration of all present.

<head>Being righteous Overmuch.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/> In the article which we copied a few days since from the <hi rend="italics">Dublin Nation,</hi> to which we have before referred, that paper, quoting the infamous and demoniac threats of the <rs>Northern</rs> journals against the <rs>South</rs>, and especially the <orgName n="New York Tribune" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi></orgName>, which declares that the rebels must not only be subjugated, but <q>&#x0022;not permitted to return to peaceful homes; they must find poverty at their firesides, and see privation in the anxious eyes of mothers and the rags of children,&#x0022;</q> exclaims with emphasis:--<q>&#x0022;Was ever more hellish sentiments uttered?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>Where, in the annals of despotism, or the records of its butcheries, shall we seek for a parallel to this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>Where, even against rebels who had not a particle of justification?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>If the subjects of the most legitimate sovereign that ever held a sceptre had acted as the <rs>Southern States</rs> have done, would these sentiments not be infamous if uttered on his part?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>Yet, infamy of infamies are they when uttered by <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> against brother <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs>--uttered by the descendants of the rebels of <num value="76">76</num> against men who, with far greater unanimity, now demand the self-same right those rebels claimed-- self-government.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/> We should like to see a collection of all the demoniac sentiments akin to those of the <hi rend="italics">Tribune,</hi> which have been uttered by the approved organs of Northern public sentiment from the beginning of this war. We should be perfectly willing to collect and bind up in the same volume the strongest utterances of the <rs>Southern</rs> press, although the <rs>South</rs>, being the invaded and menaced section, has an apology which the <rs>North</rs> cannot pretend for bitterness of feeling and emphasis of expression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>It would be found upon comparison, that the <rs>South</rs> has uttered no such infamous sentiments as those of the <rs>North</rs>; that it has never threatened any act not in accordance with the rules of civilized warfare; that it has never held up to its soldiers the appropriation of Northern farms and the desolation of Northern firesides; no such inconceivably villainous motto as <q>&#x0022;Beauty and Booty&#x0022;</q> ever defiled Southern lips.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>On the contrary, the <rs>South</rs> has only asked to be let alone, and, in the midst of the enormous provocations which she has received, has leaned to the side of forbearance and mercy, treating prisoners with kindness, and releasing, without parole, officers who had been engaged in the most barbarous acts, and who at once availed themselves of undeserved indulgence to inflict fresh injury and additional wrongs upon their benefactors. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/> It is as important for the moral as the political leaders of society, to observe and trace to its causes, this extraordinary development in the <rs>North</rs> of a degree of cruelty, vindictiveness and brutality, which, as the <name>Dublin</name> <hi rend="italics">Nation</hi> justly observes, has no parallel among the despotisms of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>The infernal sentiments of their press, which have made the whole civilized world stand aghast with amazement and horror, are also the sentiments of their people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>Their pulpit has even transcended the wickedness of their press, and their Christian Associations have vied with each other in the exhibition of the most unchristian and even devilish spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>Now, bear in mind that this is the same section which has always claimed to be the most enlightened and the most humane of mankind; that it has looked down with sublime complacency upon the barbarism and godlessness of <q>&#x0022;benighted <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>;&#x0022;</q> that it has monopolized to itself all the <q>&#x0022;vital piety&#x0022;</q> of the world, professing that its religion was a <q>&#x0022;religion of the heart,&#x0022;</q> and all other people's religion only a religion of the surface; that this is the section which exulted in its <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Bible, Tract, Missionary, Temperance, Peace, and a <num value="100">hundred</num> other pious and benevolent societies; that this is the section where, when trade became bad and there was nothing to do, people betook themselves to <address><street n="Fulton Street">Fulton Street</street></address> Prayer Meetings, and stood praying every day at the corners of the streets and in the columns of the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">N. Y. <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName>, and how shall we account for the transformation of this selt of the earth in arsenic and strychnine, of these saints and angels into incarnate fiends? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/> We submit this question to the moral philosophies but, for ourselves, we believe there has been no change of nature but only an exposure of the real character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>If we are told that allowances must be made for the effects of the war spirit, we beg to ask which has had the most provocation to violent passions and ferocious threats, the <name>North</name> or <name>South</name>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>What has the <rs>South</rs> done to the <rs>North</rs> that should run it mad in this fashion?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>On the other hand, what has not the <rs>South</rs> endured from the <rs>North</rs>, the wrongs, robberies and insults of <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure>, winding up with this wicked and inhuman invasion?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>Yet the <rs>South</rs> has not lost its balance; its Christians have not disgraced their name; its clergy have only taught lessons of humanity <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> and forbearance, and have prayed the forgiveness of enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>It is idle, then, to offer the plea of provocation as a justification of the abominable spirit which has been manifested in the <rs>North</rs> towards the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>The only provocation we have given is a firm and manly vindication of constitutional rights &mdash; of rights which we could not surrender without ceasing to be worthy of the name and prerogatives of freemen. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/> There is an injunction of Scripture which was never considered of much account among the popular religionists of the <rs>North</rs>, but which yet was dictated by the same supreme wisdom which inspired the whole of Sacred Writ, and the universal contempt of which may explain in part the <name>Bellow</name> character of much of the boasted <q>&#x0022;vital piety&#x0022;</q> of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>It is this. --<q>&#x0022;Be not righteous overmuch.&#x0022;</q> And again: <q>&#x0022;Let your moderation be known unto all men.&#x0022;</q> Whenever such counsels as these are commended to fanatics, a pious sarcasm is the only answer they vouchsafe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>Yet, it is precisely by attempting to be better than the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> demands, that zealots have inflicted more injury upon their own cause than could ever be accomplished by its enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>On various occasions, when the <rs>Divine Founder</rs> of christianity was asked what a man must do in order to inherit eternal life, he required the person propounding the inquiry, to repeat the <name>Commandments</name>, and told him to keep them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>This is so very simple a direction, and yet so distasteful and difficult of accomplishment, that mankind have ever since been engaged in being righteous in some other way, and no portion of mankind have been as successful in this respect as the New Englanders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>They have thrown the <num value="10">Ten</num> Commandments completely into the shade as mere morality; makes religion a thing of emotion and passion, instead of principle and obedience; a subject of talk, and anniversaries around street corners, instead of a daily discipline and subjugation of evil tempers and appetites.
