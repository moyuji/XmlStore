<head>The situation.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> A calm in the moral and political world has been said to bear a close analogy to a calm in the atmosphere, in so far as a convulsion is certain to follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>If this be true, we are most assuredly on the eve of great events; for we have never, in our long experience of editorial life, known such an entire dearth of news.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The very elements themselves seem to be asleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The air which we breathe is hot and stifling the sun shines with a brilliancy so intense that the atmosphere resembles a sea of flame; the earth is parched and crisp; the dust is as though it were again about to be converted into swarms of locusts as it was in the olden time by the great <rs n="Jewish" type="religion">Hebrew</rs> prophet upon the arid plains of <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Any sort of change in either the natural or political world &mdash; a thunder storm or a battle &mdash; would bring with it some relief to the insufferable tedium of the life which this community is leading.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>It will not be many days, we very much suspect, before we shall have both. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> We think is scarcely within the range of possibility that things can remain much longer stationary at <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> is said to have pushed his trenches fearfully near to our works, but as yet we are under no apprehensions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>We remember <placeName reg="Sebastopol, Scott, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057451">Sebastopol</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>We remember that it was defended from the side on which it was attacked by earthworks hastily constructed, when the enemy was within a day's march of the place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>We remember that <persName n="Pelissier,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Pelissier,nomatch:0"><surname>Pelissier</surname></persName> had to push his parallels within <placeName><distance reg="20yards">twenty yards</distance> of the <rs>Russian</rs></placeName> works, before he dared to rush, even with the grenadiers of the <orgName n="Imperial Guard" type="guard">Imperial Guard</orgName>, upon that &#x0022; <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">feu d' enfer</hi></foreign>&#x0022; which be described so feelingly, and which, at that day, had never been equalled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Remembering all this, and taking into consideration the cautions disposition of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, we are not disposed to believe that he will attempt an assault until he shall have pushed his works close up to those of the besieged, and that will require time which may bring in its train a number of incidents to put a new face upon the state of affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The sickly season will come on within a few weeks, and <persName n="Johnston,,Joe,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="default:Johnston,Joe,,,"><foreName>Joe</foreName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> is night at hand, with an army already powerful, and every day increasing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>All depends upon the steadiness of the commander is <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, and, in spite of the ill-founded prejudices against <persName n="Pemberton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Pemberton,nomatch:0"><surname>Pemberton</surname></persName> he has proved himself to be eminently brave and steadfast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>As for the reports in the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> newspapers we have long since learned to estimate them at their true value, as we have, likewise, those that come to us from <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>We do not believe that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> will ever take <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>But should they succeed in taking both that place and <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName> they will by no means have opened the navigation of the <rs>Mississippi</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>As long as we have a single battery of light field pieces left it will be impossible for any craft short of an iron-clad to navigate that river, and iron-clads are not exactly the sort of craft for carrying on trade. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> In the absence of positive information, rumors always rush in to supply its place, as the air rushes in wherever a vacuum has been formed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>There were any number of rumors in town yesterday with regard to <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, <persName n="Hooker,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="nearbymention:Hooker,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Hooker</surname></persName>, <persName n="Ewell,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Ewell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Ewell</surname></persName>, <persName n="Milroy,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Milroy,nomatch:0"><surname>Milroy</surname></persName>, and the town of <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Some of these may be seen in another column.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>None of them seem entitled to much consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/><persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="nearbymention:Hooker,Gen,,,"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName>, however, seems certainly to have evacuated <placeName reg="Stafford, Stafford, Virginia" key="tgn,2114347">Stafford</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>That we learn from a sure source, and not from rumor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>What his aim may be, nobody is able to conjecture; but the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> papers have been for some time indulging in every manner of speculation with regard to the movements of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, and probably these speculations may have some connection with the march of <persName n="Hooker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="nearbymention:Hooker,Gen,,,"><surname>Hooker</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> Upon the whole, we regard our situation as very encouraging, especially when we contrast it with that of this time last year. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head>&#x0022;On to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.&#x0022;</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> papers have the countenance to declare that the &#x0022;On to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>&#x0022; is as prevalent now in the <rs>Southern</rs> newspapers as the &#x0022;On to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>&#x0022; has been in Northern, and they appear to be in some trepidation for the fate of their capital. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> If it is any satisfaction to know that, in this, as in all other things, their newspapers lie, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation are quite welcome to the consolation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>We are not aware that any &#x0022;On to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>&#x0022; has been raised of late by the <rs>Southern</rs> press.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>There was a time when its capture might have been effected without much loss, and with damaging moral and political results to the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>But that time has passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>At all events, the <rs>Southern</rs> press is beginning to learn to leave military matters to military men. Our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> are fully competent to decide upon the practicability and policy of an &#x0022;On to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.&#x0022; If they could permit themselves to be urged to any step which their judgment might disapprove by anything that an unmilitary public might say, they would show themselves unworthy their position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Northern <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> have shown their weakness in nothing more than permitting themselves to be influenced in their action by Northern stay-at-home critics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Southern <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> are not now embarrassed by any such difficulties, nor, if they were, would they give any deed to them. &#x0022;A jay bird on a swinging limb&#x0022; would command about as much respect from a hunter of <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> as the military criticism of civilians from the thoroughbred and self-poised soldiers at the head of the <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> Moreover, the <rs>Southern</rs> press (which, it seems to us, in spite of the grumblers, who are always finding fault with newspapers, is, in most of the <name>States</name>, commendably cautions and reticent,) cannot, as a faithful exponent of the popular sentiment, evince much desire for the possession of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, on its own account, that once famous capital having become the meanest and filthiest hole of moral, political, and physical pollution in the whole <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Unless <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> can take with him chloride of lime, tar, and other disinfectants in sufficient quantity to purify <placeName key="tgn,7016893" n="1.000 1" reg="">Sodom</placeName> and Gomorrah, he would be exposing his noble army to all sorts of pestilences, of both body and soul, to quarter them in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.--That city has been for <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> and more the roosting place of all the owls, buzzards, and unclean birds and beasts of the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> and <orgName n="Abolition party" type="party">Abolition party</orgName>; the common sewer in which has been disgorged the foul and fetid stream of all that is vile and pestilential in <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> passions and polities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The stench of it would be enough to annihilate the finest army that ever walked the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The old Southern element of its society has been extirpated, and runaway negroes, nasal <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and cadaverous and unclean fanatics have made <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> the <rs>St. Giles</rs> and <placeName key="possibilities=131" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Five Points</placeName> of the civilized world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>It might be a benefit to mankind to capture the whole motley crew, from the contrabands down to the <rs>Cabinet</rs> and the <rs>President</rs>, and we should certainly advocate it if consistent with military policy and the sanitary condition of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>These are matters which <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> must judge of; but, as at present advice, we would dread bringing our <unclear></unclear> soldiers <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> into contact with such a standing pond of corruption as the <rs>Federal</rs> capital. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> Happily, if it should be deemed advisable by our military chiefs, there are more vital and vulnerable points of the enemy's territory which our army can assail than the city of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>We need not say what they are. We have no means of knowing the purposes of our military leaders; nor, if we had, should we be absurd enough to hint them.--We know that we have <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> in whom the country has confidence, and the best and bravest army that the sun ever shone upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>That somebody will be &#x0022;hurt&#x0022; in the course of time is among the possibilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>But whether we shall continue to stand on the defensive or assume the aggressive is known only to our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, and is for them to decide.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The heart of every Southern man burns to pay upon their own soil the heavy debt which the unparalleled crimes and outrages of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> at our own firesides have accumulated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>But we presume not to dictate when or where this shall be done.
