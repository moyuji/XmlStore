<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> Picket firing was constant and animated along our whole front yesterday, being much more brisk than on any former occasion, and which at <num value="1">one</num> period gave promise of service engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>On the right the discharges of musketry were regular and lively, but towards the centre the engagement between outposts was very warm and animated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Towards evening, however, the enemy being largely reinforced, made great demonstrations and hard pressed our pickets, but the <orgName type="regiment" key="GA3">3d Georgia</orgName> and some other troops arriving on the ground, boldly dashed upon and charged the enemy, driving them from their position fully <measure n="1mile" type="distance">one mile</measure>, and with loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/> --The present fabulous price of provisions of every description, with a prospective increase to a point altogether beyond the reach of persons in moderate circumstances, naturally leads to thoughtful reflection as to how a supply can be procured sufficient to hold body and soul together during the future progress of the war. Our inquiries have satisfied us that if the proper steps are taken by those whose duty it is to watch over the interests of the community the extortionate prices now demanded for food may not only be measurably reduced, but suffering hereafter averted, and the poor as well as the rich, supplied with the sustenance necessary to existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/> This act has been already the subject of a vast deal of comment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>Yet it is difficult even now to take in all its features in their full and hideous proportions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>If there is anything like it in the history of the whole world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>we are not aware of it. <persName n="Augustus,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00283" reg="mostcommon:Augustus,nomatch:0"><surname>Augustus</surname></persName> positioned out the fairest portions of <placeName key="tgn,7003237" n="1.000 6" reg="lombardy">Lombardy</placeName> among his legions, and the peaceful inhabitants were compelled to leave their country; but he provided other settlements for them, in which they could set up their household gods anew, and become in time reconciled to the loss they had sustained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>When <persName><roleName n="Emperor">the Emperor</roleName> <foreName>Nicholas</foreName></persName> subdued the <name>Polish</name> revolt of <dateStruct value="1831--"><year reg="1831">1831</year></dateStruct>, he tore vast numbers of the <name>Poise</name> from their homes; but he gave them a place in <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 5" reg="rossiya">Siberia</placeName> &mdash; a place dreary enough, it is true, and rendered more dreary by contrast with the pleasant places of <placeName key="tgn,7006366" n="1.000 33" reg="polska">Poland</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>Still, it was a home &mdash; a spot which the exile could, at least, call by that endearing title &mdash; a bit of dry land in the wilderness of bitter waters, on which he could rest the soles of his wearied feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>But for the <rs>Southern</rs> people no such spot is reserved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>If <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prowess can effect it, they are to be expelled without the hope of return, and without the possibility of finding a substitute for their confiscated homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>They are in all things to be subordinate to their <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> plunderers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>The Southern women are to be regarded only as handmaidens to the low-bred <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> hoydens, and are to be subject at all times to the brutal insolence of men like <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00284" reg="nearbymention:Butler,B.,F.,,"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>, who know no refinement, and have no fear but of the <rs>Southern</rs> horse-whip. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/> Is not this the effect, and is it not designed to be the effect, of this most iniquitous bill?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>Let us once more examine its provisions, and then decide. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/> It provides for the appointment of a Board of Tax Commissioners, who are to enter upon their duties wherever the military authority of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government has been established, and who are to sell the land in all cases where the owners refuse to pay the tax assessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>At the same time, it is provided that the land may be redeemed wherever it shall appear that the owner <hi rend="italics">has not taken part in the rebellion, or in any manner abetted it,</hi> and that he has not been able to pay the tax by reason of such rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>These are the only cases in which the land is redeemable; and they are so few and far between, that it may be said, without much exaggeration, every foot of land east of the <rs type="place">Allegheny mountains</rs> is liable to forfeiture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>If the owner has left home to join the rebels, the case is still worse, for then the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government comes in, takes full possession without any farther ceremony, and may louse or otherwise dispose of them, until the election of a loyal Legislature, unless, in the meantime, the <orgName n="Commissioners Board" type="board">Board of Commissioners</orgName> think proper to subdivide it, and sell it in panels to <hi rend="italics">loyal citizens,</hi> or any person, <hi rend="italics">whether citizen or nos, </hi> who shall have <hi rend="italics">served in the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army or navy.</hi> Nor is this all. The preemption principle is engrafted on the law, in order to hold out inducements to men to enlist for the invasion of our country, and thereby swell the numbers of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army to the greatest possible extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>Thus the property of every man who is fighting for his country is swept away by this bill &mdash; the most infernal contrivance that <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> malice has yet conceived for the destruction of the <rs>Southern</rs> people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/> But the worst feature of the law &mdash; if there can be any <hi rend="italics">worst</hi> where all is supremely bad &mdash; is that which provides for selling out the land in small parcels to those persons who have served in the army or navy; that is, to those hordes of plundering scoundrels, who are marauding through the country at this moment to the amount of several <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>These men they design to settle among us. and they are to be our masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>They are a military colony, who are to oppress the lawful owners of the soil, and to keep them down at the point of the sword, At the same time the same Congress is devising methods to tax slaves and cotton; from all which it is evident they mean, if they can, to make us pay the expenses of this war.--But they have not, thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, succeeded yet in fixing the yoke upon us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/> It is but a short time since the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs> boasted it had in the field an army of <num value="700000">seven hundred thousand</num> men. We never believed the monster falsehood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/>The fact that they have been obliged of late to call upon the <name>States</name> for militia to defend their Capital, exposes to the whole world the gigantic lie.
