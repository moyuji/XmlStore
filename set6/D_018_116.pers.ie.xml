<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> The feeling in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> for secession seems steadily to advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>In the legislative debates the only difference in the views of members is about the rapidity with which the act shall be consummated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>He thought it important that the bill should get a reading in the <name>Senate</name> today if they wished to facilitate the business before the <rs type="place">House</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>At the request of <persName n="Aldrich,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Aldrich,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Aldrich</surname></persName>, the motion was withdrawn to permit a report to be made from the <rs>Committee</rs> on Federal Relations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The report recommends an amendment to the <name>Senate</name> bill for the call of a Convention, naming the <dateStruct value="-12-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> day of <month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct> as the time for the election of delegates, instead of the <dateStruct value="-01-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>, and the <dateStruct value="-12-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> <month reg="12">December</month></dateStruct> as the time for meeting, instead of the <dateStruct value="-01-10"><day reg="10">10th</day> of <month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>, as named in the <name>Senate</name> bill. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>He was perfectly willing to vote for the <rs>Convention</rs>, to go with the <rs>State</rs>, and, when she goes, to go as far as the farthest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>But he could not agree to the amendment proposed by the <orgName n="House Committee" type="committee">House Committee</orgName> to the <name>Senate</name> bill, and hoped the <rs type="place">House</rs> would not accept the amendment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>It was absolutely necessary that those who represented large districts, the people of which were not so thoroughly posted up as to the events transpiring around them, that they should have time to canvass those districts, and bring the people up to the point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>If they shortened the time they would have no opportunity to do that, and the consequences might be that those people would occupy a false position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>It was essentially necessary to the district he represented, that the amendment should not prevail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>He was exceedingly anxious, therefore, that the time should not be changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>If they were precipitate, they might depend upon it, his district would not sustain the action of the <rs type="place">House</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>He, therefore, moved that the question be taken up by ayes and nays. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>The seat of this terrible malady is affirmed to be the lymphatic system of vessels; and of these minute tubes form a close interlacement throughout the whole body, being also endowed with much activity, diseased fluids transmitted through them are liable, under certain conditions, to be deposited anywhere, and to be spread or accumulated with prodigious rapidity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/><num value="1">One</num> party affirms that the process of nutrition is at fault, and that part of the food eaten is lazily and imperfectly assimilated, offering itself in a crude, half-prepared state, to the action of vessels not adapted to deal with such material, but only with that which has been submitted to a completer preliminary elaboration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>Hence cellular development, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> step in organization, is impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>The fluid cannot be taken up. It never becomes vitalized or forms a union with any living tissue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>That some noxious materials, whether the <hi rend="italics">debris</hi> of used up tissues, or withered dead elements refusing to become new tissues, are thrown copiously near the lymphatic, is agreed; and also that the quantity of such products is so great that this active sewerage apparatus cannot carry it away.

<head><rs type="role" reg="Prince">The Prince</rs> of <placeName reg="Wales, United Kingdom, Europe" key="tgn,7002443">Wales</placeName> in New York.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/> The correspondent of the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London Times</orgName> was famously pleased with the reception of the <rs>Prince</rs> of ales in New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>We extract a few paragraphs from his account, received by our last <name>English</name> mails: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="535"/> There was no pomp or pageantry attempted of any kind, no grand liveries or gilded coaches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>There was a military procession, but that was only an item in the great feature of the day, which was the welcome of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/>It was such a welcome as only a whole people and a free people could ever give, and in the details of its enthusiasm and its good order there was much, strange as it may seem, that made such a reception possible only in New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/><placeName key="tgn,7008038" n="1.000 1" reg="paris, department de ville de paris, ile-de-france, france, europe">In Paris</placeName> it would have been a governmental affair of soldiers and <hi rend="italics">gendarmes;</hi> in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> it would have been a mob with an immense police force to control it. Here it was simply the people turning out in hundreds of <num value="1000">thousands</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>A huge sea of decorous, but most enthusiastic spectators, who even at the spots where they were densest were yet so quiet, so impressive in their majesty of good order, that at no <num value="1">one</num> place did they seem to have a single element in common with what we call a mob. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="540"/> It seemed more a gigantic meeting of the citizens of New York, convened for some great and solemn rejoicing along the whole length of the city, than the mere chance mustering of its busy, restless, and excitable population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="541"/>It was such a grand display of popular enthusiasm, there was such a dignity in the calm reliance felt by every <num value="1">one</num> in the preservation of order, such a perfect warmth and geniality of kindness evinced from highest to lowest towards the young visitor, as made the whole demonstration, perhaps, <num value="1">one</num> of the most remarkable of its kind that has ever taken place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="542"/>Quiet and demure as are the <rs>English</rs> people, there are yet few <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs> who can realize the fact of the whole inhabitants of an immense city turning out to witness a spectacle and give a cordial welcome, intrusted at the same time with the duty of keeping order among themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="543"/>Yet this was actually the case at New York; and along <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> of road, thronged with half a <num value="1000000">million</num> or more of spectators there were not <num value="50">fifty</num> policemen, and even these were only stationed at intersecting streets to stop carts and vehicles from entering the line of the route.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="544"/>Yet description does not easily convey the idea of such a multitude &mdash; the strict, the rigid good order and good humor that prevailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="545"/>This, too, was not for an hour, or only while the <rs>Prince</rs> was passing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="546"/>It was the unvarying demeanor of the whole concourse from <num value="10">ten</num> in the day till past <num value="6">six</num> at night. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="547"/> The public of New York had been so schooled and abused by all their journals as to the necessity for a quiet, yet kindly welcome, that <num value="1">one</num> would almost have thought, from the tone of the articles, that the populace of this great city were a mere horde of untutored miscreants, people to whom it was necessary to point out the most ordinary rules of civilized intercourse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="548"/>In fact, throughout the whole course of this tour, with few exceptions, the New York journals have never ceased to heap dirt upon the manners and customs of their own countrymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="549"/>A little crowding at the country towns, the mere harmless curiosity of villagers, <hi rend="italics">en route,</hi> has been transformed in the columns of certain newspapers into studied outrages, and visited, in the columns of the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York Herald</orgName> particularly, with such a downpour of maudlin &#x0022;Billingsgate,&#x0022; as if any sensible <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> ever minded how that journal raved, must have made the poor country people regret the hour they ever saw his Royal Highness at all. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="550"/> A long, deep, tremendous, sustained cheer greeted the <rs>Prince</rs>, whose appearance astonished every <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="551"/>Slight and almost boyish in his appearance in morning dress, in uniform and on horseback he looks a young nobleman, of whom, apart from his exalted position, any <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishman</rs> might be proud to see acknowledged as a representative of his nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>He sits a horse as only young <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs> can, and receives his homage of welcome with the easy grace of <num value="1">one</num> to the manor born.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="553"/>Certainly, as he cantered down to the <rs type="place">Battery</rs>, his horse rearing and prancing with timidity at the tumult of cheers around, he looked even worthy of the great welcome that awaited him, and more than this it would be difficult to say.--In the <rs type="place">Battery</rs> were drawn up in successive lines <num value="5">five</num> brigades of the <orgName type="mil" key="NYMilitia">New York militia</orgName>--mustering in all some <num value="6000">6,000</num> or <num value="7000">7,000</num> men.--Taken as a type of the volunteers of this country, they certainly were splendid specimens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/>In the <orgName type="regiment" key="3Brigade">3d brigade</orgName> were the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 7">7th regiment</orgName>, the pride and admiration of New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>They are undoubtedly, a most perfect body of soldiers, equal in all the minute technicalities of discipline to our very best line regiments. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/> I must own, however, I cannot share in the feeling here which awards all praise to the <num value="7" type="ordinal">7th</num>, and I cannot pay the militia of New York a higher compliment than to say that, to my unprejudiced eye, there were several other regiments there almost, if not quite, as good as the famous <num value="7" type="ordinal">7th</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="4Brigade">4th Brigade</orgName>, to use <persName n="Russell,Lord,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00224" reg="default:Russell,John,,,"><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName>'s simile, was "conspicuous for the absence of the <orgName type="regiment" key="Regiment 69">69th Regiment</orgName>. <persName n="Corcoran,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00225" reg="mostcommon:Corcoran,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Corcoran</surname></persName> and his officers and men refused to turn out to welcome the <rs>Prince</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/>The inspection of the militia merely consisted of riding slowly along the front of each corps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>Every regiment drooped colors and presented arms as the <rs>Prince</rs> approached them surveying with open admiration the handsome uniforms, the erect, steady, military aspect of every company, regiment, and brigade on the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>As a volunteer militia, they certainly formed a body of men of whom any nation might feel proud. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
