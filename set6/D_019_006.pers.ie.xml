<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/></item> </list> 
<p> The <num value="2">two</num> propositions, though seemingly paradoxical, are perfectly consistent, and are based upon the fundamental principles which underlie our <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/> No constitutional right of a single State can be trampled upon by the <rs>Federal Government</rs> or by <num value="1">one</num> of the <name>States</name> which compose it, without impairing the <rs>Union</rs> itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>Its security, peace and perpetuity, are all involved in the jealous vigilance with which each separate <orgName n="State Guards" type="guards">State guards</orgName> its constitutional rights; while submission to oppression and wrong would not only enslave the <rs>State</rs> upon which they were visited, but impair the honor and safety of the <rs>Union</rs> to which she belongs </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/> I am sure you fully endorse both propositions, and are the last person in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> who would repudiate either. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/> How, now, shall we practically apply them in the present crisis!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>Here many of us differ, and we differ, too, from day to day; for, what seemed to be the best course yesterday, (so rapidly does the current of public affairs culminate,) would not do to-day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/> There is no question between us of the <rs>South</rs> in reference to the bill of grievances. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/> Our constitutional compact has not only been violated to letter, but in spirit; and we find those who have been the <rs type="role" reg="chief-Agent">chief agents</rs> in the work of violator now riding into power and taking possession of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, that they may, by the forms of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, still further trample upon our constitutional rights.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/> Shall we submit!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>Never; no. never!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>We would be unworthy of our fathers, who counted not the cost, but freely pledged life, fortune and honor, rather than submit to wrong &mdash; to oppression. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/> Then we must seek redress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>In what way?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>It seems to me, now, that if the <rs>Southern States</rs> had gone into Conference last spring and drawn up a bill of grievances, and presented an <hi rend="italics">ultimatum,</hi> present difficulties might have been obviated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>I did not think so then, but the course of affairs since has led me to the conclusion, that <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> erred in refusing this Conference.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>If nothing else had been secured, unity in the <name>Presidential</name> contest might have been promoted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/> But this failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>Now, it does seem to me. that we in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> are stopped from complaint against <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> for her separate action, after refusing to go into Conference with her. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/> We may think she has acted precipitately, or rashly, or selfishly; but we refused to counsel with her, and left her, in the hour of common peril, to take counsel of herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>Whether she acted-wisely or unwisely &mdash; for the best interest of the <rs>South</rs> or not &mdash; for or against our own interest, she has acted &mdash; the <rs>Southern States</rs> acting in concert with her are about to act, and we in <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> are irresistibly, by the force of circumstances, to shape our course, not by the consideration of what might have been best, if <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> had not seceded, or matters had not gone so far, but by facts as they are; and as she would not breast the storm, and lead others who would have gladly followed her proud flag, she must be content to shape her action as may be best in the forced circumstances by which she is at present surrounded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/> It seems to me she is compelled to meet this crisis, and have questions at issue settled; and the point is, how she may do this, with less damage to herself and her peculiar interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>Some advise that we remain in the <rs>Union</rs> and make a solemn demand upon the <rs>North</rs> for redress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>But what avail will be the weak cry of <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName>, stripped of the united strength of her sister Southern States?

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/> Or admit that redress were secured; how could she remain in a Union, overpowered as she would be by the united sentiment of the <rs>North</rs>, without additional constitutional guarantees?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>And could she get them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>I know not. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/> Others, considering the dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs> inevitable, are suggesting a Middle Confederacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>While I see no advantage in this arrangement, that could not be as fully secured in an united South, there are many serious objections to it. It increases our hostile frontier, while it weakens our means of defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>I could not favor such a diminution of our political <hi rend="italics">status,</hi> except under the force of an overruling necessity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/> My opinion is, that the safety of the <rs>Union</rs> depends upon an united South, on the common issue, which has exposed us to the common peril. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/> Let the whole <rs>South</rs> act in concert.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>It <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> has proceeded so far that she cannot, in honor, counsel with us, let the other Southern States act together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>If the country can be saved, without recourse to the <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">ultima ratio,</hi></foreign> by all means save the country.--If this be impossible, then it is not worth while to argue upon the abstract right of secession &mdash; we will all act upon it &mdash; and if no constitutional power exists in the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, as <persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00063" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> and his <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">Attorney General</rs> think, to coerce, then, we may secede peaceably, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> settling the common debt and dividing the common property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>My belief is, that when the <rs>North</rs> sees that the whole <rs>South</rs> is in <hi rend="italics">real earnest;</hi> that the country is gone, unless they relent in their unfriendly attitude, they will submit to any conditions consistent with justice and right and honor.--We have assurance of this, in the large conservative element of the <rs>North</rs>, who have been all along fighting for us, and who have been at last overpowered by the combination of opposing elements. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/> We shall have the conscience of those <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs>, who have been misled and betrayed into their present associations, but who really desire to do justice and to avoid wrong; and the noisy clamor for &#x0022;bread or blood&#x0022; will frighten those who know no other appeal than that which springs from such a demand. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/> Now, can the <rs>South</rs> be brought to act thus in concert?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>I hope it-may.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>I <hi rend="italics">think</hi> there is patriotism enough in the <rs>South</rs> to do it. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/> Did ever a people bear as long as we have?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>Surely, surely, our patriotism has been tried, and it has not been found wanting. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/> We all desire to preserve this proud fabric of our <orgName n="National Union" type="newspaper">National Union</orgName>, and that we do so, is evident from the fact that we are willing to make such sacrifices for it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/> Every fibre of our Southern heart has been stretched to preserve it, and if it falls, the united Southern voice can say-- &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">It was not I that did it.</hi>&#x0022; </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="840"/> For some time longer he took no apparent notice of the child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="841"/>He even hardened his heart into disregarding her sudden flush of color and little timid smile of recognition when he saw her by chance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="842"/>But, after all, this could not last forever; and, having a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time given way to tenderness, there was no relapse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="843"/>The insidious enemy having thus entered his heart in the guise of compassion to the child, soon assumed the more dangerous form of interest in the mother.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="844"/>He was a ware of this change of feeling &mdash; despised himself for it &mdash; struggled with it; nay, internally yielded to it and cherished it long before he suffered the slightest expression of it, by word, action, or look, to escape him. He watched <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName>'s docile, obedient ways to her stepmother; the love which she had inspired in the rough Norah (roughened by the wear and tear of sorrow and years;) but, above all, he saw the wild, deep, passionate affection existing between her and her child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/>They spoke little to any <num value="1">one</num> else, or when any <num value="1">one</num> else was by; but, when alone together, they talked, and murmured, and cooed, and chattered so continually, that <persName n="Openshaw,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00487" reg="mostcommon:Openshaw,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Openshaw</surname></persName> <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> wondered what they could find to say to each other, and next became irritated because they were always so grave and silent with him. All this time he was perpetually devising small new pleasures for the child.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/>His thoughts ran, in a pertinacious way, upon the desolate life before her; and often he came back from his day's work loaded with the very thing <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName> had been longing for, but had not been able to procure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/><num value="1">One</num> time it was a little chair for drawing the little sufferer along the streets, and many an evening that following summer <persName n="Openshaw,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00488" reg="mostcommon:Openshaw,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Openshaw</surname></persName> drew her along himself, regardless of the remarks of his acquaintances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/><num value="1">One</num> day in autumn he put down his newspaper as <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName> came in with the breakfast, and said, in as indifferent a voice as he could assume-- </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/> <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName> stood still in a perplexed wonder.--What did he mean?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>He had resumed the reading of his newspaper as if he did not expect any answer; so she found silence her latest course, and went on quietly arranging his breakfast without another word passing between them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/>Just as he was leaving the house to go to the warehouse as usual, he turned back and put his head into the bright, neat, tidy kitchen, where all the women breakfasted in the morning: </p> <cit><q rend="break">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/> &#x0022;You'll think of what I said, <persName n="Frank,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00490" reg="mostcommon:Frank,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Frank</surname></persName>,&#x0022; (this was her name with the lodgers,) &#x0022;and let me have your opinion upon it to-night.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="854"/> <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName> was thankful that her mother and Norah were too busy talking together to attend much to the speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>She determined not to think about it at all through the day, and of course, the effort not to think made her think all the more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="856"/>At night she sent up Norah with his tea. But <persName n="Openshaw,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00491" reg="mostcommon:Openshaw,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Openshaw</surname></persName> almost knocked Norah down as she was going out at the door by pushing past her and calling out &#x0022;<persName n="Frank,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00492" reg="mostcommon:Frank,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Frank</surname></persName>!&#x0022; in an impatient voice, at the top of the stairs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="857"/> <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName> went up, rather than seem to have affixed too much meaning to his words. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="858"/> &#x0022;Well, <persName n="Frank,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00493" reg="mostcommon:Frank,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs</roleName> <surname>Frank</surname></persName>,&#x0022; he said, &#x0022;what answer?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="859"/>Don't make it too long, for I have lots of office work to get through to-night.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="860"/> &#x0022;I hardly know what you meant, sir,&#x0022; said truthful <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="861"/> &#x0022;Well, I should have thought you might have guessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="862"/>You're not new at this sort of work, and I am. However, I'll make it plain this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="863"/>Will you have me to be thy wedded husband, and serve me, and love me, and honor me, and all that sort of thing?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="864"/>Because, if you will, I will do as much by you and be a father to your child &mdash; and that's more than is put in the Prayer-book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="865"/>Now I'm a man of my word, and what I say I feel, and what I promise I'll do. Now for your answer.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="866"/> <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName> was silent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="867"/>He began to make the tea as if her reply was a matter of perfect indifference to him; but, as soon as that was done, he became impatient. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="868"/> &#x0022;Well?&#x0022; said he. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="869"/> &#x0022;How long, sir, may I have to think over it?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="870"/> &#x0022;<measure n="3minutes" type="date">Three minutes</measure>,&#x0022; (looking at his watch.)--&#x0022;You've had <num value="2">two</num> already &mdash; that makes <num value="5">five</num>.--Be a sensible woman, say Yes, and sit down to tea with me, and we'll talk it over together, for after tea I shall be busy; say No,&#x0022; (he hesitated a moment to try and keep his voice in the same tone,) &#x0022;and I shan't say another word about it, but pay up a year's rent for my rooms to-morrow, and be off.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="871"/> &#x0022;If you please, sir &mdash; you have been so good to little Ailsie--&#x0022; </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="873"/>I am glad to find you are as good and sensible as I took you for.&#x0022; </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="874"/> And this was <persName n="Wilson,,Alice,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00494" reg="default:Wilson,Alice,,,"><foreName>Alice</foreName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName>'s <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> wooing. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="875"/> <persName n="Openshaw,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00495" reg="mostcommon:Openshaw,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Openshaw</surname></persName>'s will was too strong, and his circumstances too good, for him not to carry all before him. He settled <persName n="Wilson,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00496" reg="nearbymention:Wilson,Alice,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName> in a comfortable house of her own, and made her quite independent of lodgers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="876"/>The little that <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName> said with regard to future plans was in Norah's behalf. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="877"/> &#x0022;No,&#x0022; said <persName n="Openshaw,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00497" reg="mostcommon:Openshaw,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Openshaw</surname></persName>. &#x0022;Norah shall take care of the old lady as long as she lives, and after that she shall either come and live with us, or, if she likes it better, she shall have a provision for life &mdash; for your sake, missus.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="878"/>No <num value="1">one</num> who has been good to you or the child shall go unrewarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="879"/>But even the little <num value="1">one</num> will be better for some fresh stuff about her. Get her a bright, sensible girl as a nurse; <num value="1">one</num> who won't go rubbing her with calf's-foot jelly, as Norah does, wasting good stuff outside that ought to go in, but will follow doctor's directions, which, as you must see pretty clearly by this time, Norah won't, because they give the poor little wench pain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="880"/>Now I'm not above being fresh for other folks myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="881"/>I can stand a good blow, and never change color; but, set me in the operating-room in the <name>Infirmary</name>, and I turn as sick as a girl.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="882"/>Yet, if need were, I would hold the little wench on my knees while she screeched with pain, if it were to do her poor back good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="883"/>Nay, nay, wench!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="884"/>keep your white looks for the time when it comes &mdash; I don't say it ever will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="885"/>But this I know, Norah will spare the child and cheat the doctor, if she can. Now, I say, give the barn a year or <num value="2">two</num>--chance, and then, when the pack of doctors have done their best &mdash; and, maybe, the old lady has gone &mdash; we'll have Norah back, or do better for her.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/>The pack of doctors could do no good to little <sic>Alisie</sic>; she was beyond their power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/>But her father (for so he insisted on being called, and also on <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName>'s no longer retaining the appellation of mamma, but becoming henceforward mother,) by his healthy cheerfulness of manner, his clear decision of purpose, his old turns and quirks of humor, added to his real strong love for the helpless little girl, infused a new element of brightness and confidence into her life; and, though her back remained the same, her general health was strengthened, and <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName> &mdash; never going beyond a smile herself &mdash; had the pleasure of seeing her child taught to laugh. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/> As for <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName>'s own life, it was happier than it had ever been before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="889"/><persName n="Openshaw,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00498" reg="mostcommon:Openshaw,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Openshaw</surname></persName> required no demonstration, no expressions of affection from her. Indeed, these would rather have disgusted him. <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName> could love deeply, but could not talk about it. The perpetual requirement of loving words, looks, and caresses, and misconstruing their absence into absence of love, had been the great trial of her former married life Now, all went on clear and straight, under the guidance of her husband's strong sense, warm heart, and powerful will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="890"/>Year by year their worldly prosperity in creased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="891"/>At <persName n="Wilson,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00499" reg="nearbymention:Wilson,Alice,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName>'s death Norah came back to them as nurse to the newly-born little <persName><foreName>Edwin</foreName></persName>, into which post she was not installed without a pretty strong oration on the part of the proud and happy father, who declared that if he found out that Norah ever tried to screen the boy by a falsehood, or to make himself either in body or mind, she should go that very day.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="892"/> This was the previous history of the <name>Lancashire</name> family who had now removed to <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="893"/>They had been there about a year, when <persName n="Openshaw,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00501" reg="mostcommon:Openshaw,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Openshaw</surname></persName> suddenly informed his wife that he had determined to heal long-standing fends, and had asked his uncle and <persName><roleName n="Aunt">aunt</roleName> <foreName>Chadwick</foreName></persName> to come and pay them a visit and see <persName n="London,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00502" reg="mostcommon:London,nomatch:0"><surname>London</surname></persName>.--<persName n="Openshaw,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00503" reg="mostcommon:Openshaw,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Openshaw</surname></persName> had never seen this uncle and aunt of her husband's.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="894"/>All she knew was, that <persName n="Chadwick,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00504" reg="mostcommon:Chadwick,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chadwick</surname></persName> was a small manufacturer in a country town in South Lancashire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="895"/>She was extremely pleased that the breach was to be healed, and began making preparations to render their visit pleasant. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="896"/>They arrived at last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="898"/>A for night before the day of her departure for <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> she had formally called to take leave of all her acquaintances, saying she should need every bit of the intermediate time for packing up. It was like a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> wedding in her imagination; and, to complete the resemblance which an entirely new wardrobe made between the <num value="2">two</num> events, her husband brought her back from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Manchester</placeName>, on the last market-day before they set off, a gorgeous pearl and amethyst breach, saying, &#x0022;Lunnon should see that <placeName key="tgn,7008154" n="1.000 10" reg="lancashire,england,united kingdom,europe">Lancashire</placeName> folks knew a handsome thing when they saw it.&#x0022; </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="902"/>The housemaid and cook sat below, Norah hardly knew where.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="903"/>She was always engrossed in the nursery, in tending her <num value="2">two</num> children, and sitting by the restless, excitable Ailsie till she fell asleep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="904"/>By-and-by the housemaid, Bessy, tapped gently at the door.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="905"/>Norah went to her, and they spoke in whispers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="906"/> &#x0022;Nurse, there's some <num value="1">one</num> down stairs wants you.&#x0022; </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="912"/> &#x0022;Well, a man, then, and he asks for you, and he rang at the front-door bell, and has walked into the dining-room.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="913"/> &#x0022;You should never have let him in,&#x0022; exclaimed Norah; &#x0022;master and missus out--&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="914"/> &#x0022;I did not want him to come in; but when he heard you lived here, he walked past me, and sat down on the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> chair, and said, &#x0027;Tell her to come and speak to me.&#x0027; There is no gas lighted in the room, and supper is all set out.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="915"/> &#x0022;He'll be off with the spoons,&#x0022; exclaimed Norah, putting the housemaid's fear into words, and preparing to leave the room; <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, however, giving a look to Ailsie, sleeping soundly and calmly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="916"/> Down stairs she went, uneasy fears stirring in her bosom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="917"/>Before she entered the dining-room she provided herself with a candle, and, with it in her hand, she went in, looking around her in the darkness for her visitor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="918"/> He was standing up, holding by the table.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="919"/>Norah and he looked at each other, gradual recognition coming into their eyes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="920"/> &#x0022;Norah?&#x0022; at length he asked. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="921"/> &#x0022;Who are you?&#x0022; asked Norah, with the sharp tones of alarm and incredulity. &#x0022;I don't know you;&#x0022; trying, by futile words of disbelief, to do away with the terrible fact before her. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="922"/> &#x0022;Am I so changed?&#x0022; he said, pathetically.--&#x0022;I dare say I am. But, Norah, tell me,&#x0022; he breathed hard, &#x0022;where is my wife?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="923"/>Is she &mdash; is she alive?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="924"/> He came nearer to Norah, and would have taken her hand, but she backed away from him, looking at him all the time with staring eyes, as if he were some horrible object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="925"/>Yet he was a handsome, bronzed, good looking fellow, with beard and mustache, giving him a foreign-looking aspect; but his eyes!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="926"/>there was no mistaking those eager, beautiful eyes &mdash; the very same that Norah had watched not half an hour ago, till sleep stole softly over them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="927"/> &#x0022;Tell me, Norah &mdash; I can bear it &mdash; I have feared it so often.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="928"/>Is she dead?&#x0022; Norah still kept silence. &#x0022;She is dead!&#x0022; He hung on Norah's words and looks as if for confirmation or contradiction. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="929"/> &#x0022;What shall I do?&#x0022; groaned Norah. &#x0022;Oh, sir, why did you come?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="930"/>how did you find me out?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="931"/>where have you been?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="932"/>We thought you dead we did indeed.&#x0022;She poured out words and questions to gain time, as if time would help her. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="933"/> &#x0022;Norah, answer me this question straight, by yes or no &mdash; Is my wife dead?&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="934"/> &#x0022;No, she is not,&#x0022; said Norah, slowly and heavily. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="935"/> &#x0022;Oh, what a relief!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="936"/>Did she receive my letters?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="937"/>But perhaps you don't know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="938"/>Why did you leave her?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="939"/>Where is she?
