<head>The call for Militia.--home defence.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/> The calling out of the militia, with a prospect of early and difficult service, has, as we anticipated, occasioned a good deal of excitement, and the necessity for such a step is seriously questioned and in many instances sharply criticized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>This call embraces <placeName reg="Hanover, Hanover, Virginia" key="tgn,2112147">Hanover</placeName>, <placeName reg="Henrico, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1002467">Henrico</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond city</placeName> on the north, and <placeName reg="Chesterfield, Chesterfield, Virginia" key="tgn,2111165">Chesterfield</placeName> and some dozen other counties on the southside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>We have endeavored, from time to time, to stir up the energies of the people in behalf of the measures for local defence instituted by the authorities in and about this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>It seems to us that now is a favorable occasion to repeat the suggestion, on a more extended scale.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>Persons in the various counties included in the call might, at a less sacrifice of personal comfort, organize into companies and co-operate with <persName n="Burwell,Mister,W.,P.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00268" reg="default:Burwell,W.,P.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Burwell</surname></persName> and <persName n="Pannill,Mister,J.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00269" reg="default:Pannill,J.,,,"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>Pannill</surname></persName>, of this city, in their endeavors to raise a regiment for the express purpose of manning the batteries.
