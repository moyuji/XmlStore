<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> An extra session of the <orgName n="South Carolina Legislature" type="legislature">South Carolina Legislature</orgName>, called by the <rs>Governor</rs>, commenced at <placeName reg="Columbia, Maury, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098585">Columbia</placeName> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The Governor, in his message, says that the distillation of spirits from the cereal grains of the <rs>State</rs>, though prohibited by law, is yet a great and growing evil, and seriously felt in the grain-growing districts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>With relation to the cotton crop and speculation he says: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> It is much feared, that while your act to limit the production of cotton to <measure n="3acres" type="area">three acres</measure> to the full hand will restrain such as having overflowing granaries, contemplate withholding their grain from market and planting cotton almost exclusively, it has yet induced many, as I am informed, who purposed planting little if any cotton, to plant the full number of acres allowed by law. And this is justified upon the ground that your statute is equivalent to an announcement by the chosen representatives of the people that such a course is not unpatriotic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>If this feeling prevails extensively it will be readily perceived what must be the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>All fertilizers will be put on the cotton lands to stimulate them to the highest production, while the corn lands will be thus proportionately impoverished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>In my <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> message in <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct> last, in commending to your favorable consideration the <rs>Georgia</rs> law, I recommended the reduction of the number of acres below <num value="3">three</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>With the lights now before me I recommend an amendment of your act, so as to prohibit the planting over <num value="0.5">a half</num>, or, at most, <num value="1">one</num> acre to the full hand and that the hands to be enumerated shall only be such as work in the crop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>I invite your <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attention to this subject, and recommend, in the event a further restriction is imposed, that the two Houses ratify the act immediately after its passage. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Under these circumstances, I have called into exercise the power conferred upon me by the <rs>Constitution</rs>, to prohibit, for <measure n="30days" type="date">thirty days</measure>, the exportation of provision from the <rs>State</rs>, but with some modifications which I felt were due to our sister States and the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>I recommend the passage of an act which will authorize the <rs>Governor</rs>, through proper agents, to dispose, at their market value, such articles as have been or may be seized <hi rend="italics">in transitu</hi> and after paying all expenses incurred out of the proceeds to retain a certain proportion, to be distributed among the <name>Soldiers</name>' Boards of Relief, the remainder to be returned to the owner &mdash; or such other appropriate legislation as you may deem better adapted to the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>I also recommend that you adopt some legislation to arrest the purchase and monopoly of articles of prime necessity, even when it is not intended to export them beyond the limits of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>For he is no common nigger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>Learning that the darkies of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> were about to send a deputation of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class contrabands to call upon him, he caused it to be understood that he was not receiving visits from colored persons just now!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>This dignified and diplomatic intimation did not increase his popularity with the native ebony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>They had fallen into the remarkable delusion that in the conception of a negro liberty and equality are equally venerated, whereas, of all aristocrats on the face of the earth, the <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> is the most lofty and uncompromising.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>We shall be greatly surprised if his sable <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs> receives the visits of or nary white folk, to say nothing of negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>We are not informed whether the new plenipotentiary belongs to the nobility of Hayti, that select and highly-scented order whose representatives, the <rs>Duke</rs> of Marmalade and the <rs>Count de Traffics</rs>, are in all respects worthy to be hand and glove with <persName n="Russell,Lord,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00111" reg="default:Russell,John,,,"><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName> and <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Palmerston</foreName></persName>; but if so, we wonder that he is willing to associate on terms of intimacy with <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00112" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> and <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00113" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>We take it for granted that it is only imperative interests of State which induce him to consent to such intercourse. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/> The <placeName reg="Hispaniola" key="tgn,7004625">island of Hayti</placeName>, as our readers are aware, was once the most fertile spot of the <rs>Western Hemisphere</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>Within the limits of that <num value="1">one</num> island were crowded the most wonderful variety of tropical productions that any equal space of territory on the earth's surface could present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>Men's blood has scarcely yet ceased to curdle with the horrors of that insurrection by which Hayti was wrested from the hands of its white proprietors and converted into a negro empire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>From that hour it began to decline in every element of wealth and prosperity; its exports fell off to nothing; the people became barbarians, and the island a wilderness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>The writer of this has himself seen crowds of negro vagabonds begging the crew of a man of war's boat for the tough biscuit known among sailors as &#x0022;hard tack,&#x0022; when, by <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> work a day in an island of such prodigious fertility, any laborer could obtain a comfortable support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>But the laziest, the most dissolute, the most Heaven forsaken, of all the populations of the earth, are the inhabitants of that island, whom <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00114" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> has appropriately invited to hold communion with himself and his Government at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>In the horrible scenes of the <rs>St Domingo</rs> insurrection we see what the monster who fills the <rs>Executive</rs> chair at the <rs>Federal Capital</rs> is laboring to bring upon the most fertile portion of what he still claims as his own country; and in the mournful ruin and desolation which have come upon the fairest island of the <rs>Western Archipelago</rs>, the silent and solitary desert which the <rs>South</rs> would be come in the event of the success of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00115" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>We think it is eminently right and proper that the <name>Gorilla</name> and the negro should establish close and fraternal relations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>If either is degraded by the intercourse, it is the gentleman from Hayti.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>We have no high opinion of the virtues of his countryman, but he must be the most outre and vicious of her multitudinous vagabonds if he is not a man of better manners than <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00116" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and better morals than <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00117" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName>.
