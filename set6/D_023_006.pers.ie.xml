<head>The movements.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/> Our news column, devoted to the movements of the armies below <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, gives all the information we have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>Indeed, facts concerning the operations of our forces are hard to obtain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>Since <dateStruct><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct>, up to yesterday morning, there had been no fighting of a serious nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>The enemy was employed in escaping, and in selecting positions of safety or defence for those who did not get off altogether.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>It is reported that he had on Saturday a large force in position near <persName n="Carter,Mister,Hill,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00198" reg="default:Carter,Hill,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Hill</foreName> <surname>Carter</surname></persName>'s probably on his estate, industriously employed in strengthening its defences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>It was also reported that strong reinforcements had been sent to join <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00199" reg="nearbymention:McClellan,Monday,,,"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> and had arrived. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/> As the enemy commands the river, he has many advantages; but we suppose our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> have an eye to these and have taken measures accordingly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/> A great battle was anticipated on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, and again on yesterday, to take place at the point above named, where the enemy was apparently disposed to make a stand. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="3"> 
<head>The enemy's retreat.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/> The enemy's retreat was certainly managed with coolness and generalship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>This meed of praise is due him. We have been incredulous from the beginning about the capture of the entire Federal army, or indeed the main part of it. It would be indeed an extraordinary event if an army so large should be surrounded and captured by <num value="1">one</num> inferior to it in numbers, especially when that army fought on a peninsula and <hi rend="italics">commanded the water's on both sides of it. </hi> There was reason to expect, as a matter of course, that our army would take a part of the <rs>Federal</rs> force, provided it whipped that force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>How many, depended upon circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>It has been suggested that the number of our prisoners is diminished by the delinquency of some prominent officer on our side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>Rumor makes most serious charges of blundering, and unfitness on the part indeed of more than <num value="1">one</num> such officer, as leading to the partial frustration of the general plan of operations and the sacrifice, most unnecessarily, of hundreds of our brave volunteers on the field of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>Rumor is a great prevaricator, as all know; but if there be the slightest foundation for what she has retailed on these points, it is due to the service and the cause that some rigid measures be taken to punish such gross violations of discipline. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/> We think it a matter of regret that the public expectation was raised very high, at the beginning of the great effort to whip and eject the enemy from his position, as to the capturing of his whole force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>The brilliant victory we have gained is overslaughed by the sanguine expectation of the wholesale capture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>And now that it is pretty well ascertained that the great body of the enemy's force has escaped, the triumph is measurably forgotten in the cavilling at the failure to bag the whole concern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>The victory is brilliant and complete without the capture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>Our chivalrous army has driven from its fortifications, and ingloriously from the scene of its operations before <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, the most splendidly equipped and the best drilled and largest army every organized on this continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>The disaster to that army is <num value="1">one</num> of the severest, and the victory to our troops is glorious.
