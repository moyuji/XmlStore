<head>The situation</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/> We have little to say this morning upon the present aspect of affairs, because we know but little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>There has been no official intelligence from <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName> or the neighborhood, and the report in circulation yesterday that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had burned it, is, we believe, credited by nobody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>From the front we have almost as little.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>On the evening of <persName n="Grant,,Monday,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00336" reg="default:Grant,Monday,,,"><foreName>Monday</foreName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> sent in a flag of truce for permission to bury his dead, thereby acknowledging a defeat, in spite of all his shuffling to avoid such an acknowledgement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>Doubtless, had it depended on him alone, he would have suffered them to lie where they fell until the flesh had rotted off their bones; but prisoners say his men had already been rendered almost mutinous by his inhuman indifference, and the pressure outside was too great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>The permission asked was granted, as a matter of course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>The removal of so many decaying carcasses will prove a great relief to our soldiers, whose position was becoming almost intolerable from the stench. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head><persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00337" reg="mostcommon:Stanton,nomatch:0"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName>'s Dispatches</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/> It is a very adroit arrangement of the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs> to establish a telegraphic correspondence between <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00338" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName> and New York--<persName n="Stanton,Secretary of War,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00339" reg="mostcommon:Stanton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</roleName> <surname>Stanton</surname></persName> at the <rs>Washington</rs> end, and Collector <persName n="Dix,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00340" reg="mostcommon:Dix,nomatch:0"><surname>Dix</surname></persName> at the New York end &mdash; for the purpose of communicating the tidings of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00341" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Monday,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s Virginia campaign, in the style most favorable to Government credit and to enlistments in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>It has succeeded admirably well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>The bulls in <address><street n="Wall street">Wall street</street></address>, with the help of the many <num value="1000">thousands</num> of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, so inhumanly, and needlessly led to the <rs>Virginia</rs> shambles, by the <rs>Northern</rs> butcher, have been altogether unable to carry gold above <num value="190">190</num>; nor could they keep it there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/><persName n="Chase,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00342" reg="mostcommon:Chase,nomatch:0"><surname>Chase</surname></persName>, aided by a telegraph from <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00343" reg="mostcommon:Stanton,nomatch:0"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName>, which threw dust in the public eye, contrived to bring it down to <num value="187.75">187&#x00BE;</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>So artfully contrived have been <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00344" reg="mostcommon:Stanton,nomatch:0"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName>'s messages to <persName n="Dix,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00345" reg="mostcommon:Dix,nomatch:0"><surname>Dix</surname></persName>, that the <rs>Northern</rs> public are now completely bamboozled &mdash; They have been eased off, from point to point of disappointment, and so completely assured of the successful progress of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00346" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Monday,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s &#x0022;on to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>,&#x0022; that, by this time, they must conclude that they have mentally most egregiously wronged their Hero, their <persName><foreName>Ulysses</foreName></persName>, by ever having for a moment supposed that he was to have gotten to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> more rapidly than he has, or by any other route than that he has taken ! They will next send a great committee to the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, or wherever else he may be, to ask his pardon for the great injustice they have done him ! and further to assure him, that he has done exactly as he should, and exactly what the <rs>Government</rs> expected of him ! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/> The brazen assurance of <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00347" reg="mostcommon:Stanton,nomatch:0"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName>'s announcements to the public, through <persName n="Dix,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00348" reg="mostcommon:Dix,nomatch:0"><surname>Dix</surname></persName>, down faces all questioning and cross-examination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>There are none to raise a doubt.--They are overwhelming by their coolness and effrontery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>Truth stands not the slightest chance in lifting up her gentle voice in the <name>Great Gotham</name>, and makes no effort.--The lies fly out to all the corners of the earth from the modern <rs>Sodom</rs>, undisputed and unimpeded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>The grossest inconsistencies are smothered over &mdash; the most decided reverses concealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>We question now, whether a man in the <rs>North</rs> has ever found out that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00349" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s call for a general national thanksgiving for a great victory, was made when there was not only no victory, but a disaster to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>They either do not allow their minds to inquire into the fact, or <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00350" reg="mostcommon:Stanton,nomatch:0"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName>'s messages have enveloped the past of the <rs>Virginia</rs> campaign in so much mystery that they have forgotten even that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00351" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> ever roused up the public with his excited appeal to national thanks and rejoicing for victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/><persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00352" reg="mostcommon:Stanton,nomatch:0"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName> has played upon them like a master musician upon an instrument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>Beginning with a furious introduction, just suited to <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00353" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Monday,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s terrific assaults when he crossed the <rs>Rapidan</rs>, he has gradually and with gracefully modulated changes, brought them down to a series of gentler passages, sliding from <num value="1">one</num> to another, as <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00354" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Monday,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> does from <num value="1">one</num> position to another by his &#x0022;left,&#x0022; And the instrument responds as readily to the altered harmony as ever instrument did. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/> Nevertheless there are promises of discord &mdash; some strings soon to be touched that are out of tune to the <rs>Lincoln</rs> organ, that will cause no little jarring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>The extreme <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republicans</rs> will not fail to avail themselves of the discomfiture of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00355" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s grand expedition for the capture of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, as soon as it is sufficiently manifest through the clouds from the <orgName n="War Office" type="office">War office</orgName>, gotten up to conceal the fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>Nor will the friends of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00356" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> remain silent while so grand an opportunity is afforded to vindicate their hero.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>Never was there a greater personal triumph than that now enjoyed by <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00357" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> over his rival.

The friends of <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00359" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Monday,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> have brought him forward in comparison with <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00360" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, and have claimed for him the superiority in every sense, while they have predicted for him success where <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00361" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> signally failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>He was to eschew especially the miserable strategy of his ill-fated predecessor, who, having lost favor and reputation, was subjected to the final humiliation of loosing the sword awarded by &#x0022;<persName n="Fair,,Vanity,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00362" reg="default:Fair,Vanity,,,"><foreName>Vanity</foreName> <surname>Fair</surname></persName>&#x0022; to the greatest <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> General.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>If revenge is sweet to <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00363" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> he has now an anchovy that he may roll in his mouth with delight. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/> We shall no doubt hear from both these sources, and the great <rs>Ulysses</rs> will have justice done him. So will the <rs>Government</rs> in this huge final struggle for crushing the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>Whether it takes gold up and brings down greenbacks or not; whether it depresses enlistments or not, the truth, on this subject, so far as it may help <persName n="Fremont,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00364" reg="mostcommon:Fremont,nomatch:0"><surname>Fremont</surname></persName> and give a triumph to <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00365" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, will find its way to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/> This man is perhaps the most genuine representative existing of Northern politicians, perhaps of Northern society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>In that society, every thing is for sale; virtue, patriotism, the honesty of men, and the honor of women, are all regarded but as so many commodities in the market, waiting to be knocked down to the highest bidder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>With them, Government is a huge job, and he the most successful statesman who makes the most of it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/><persName n="Cochrane,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00368" reg="nearbymention:Cochrane,John,,,"><surname>Cochrane</surname></persName> lathe product of a society in the last stage of rottenness, and he acts after his kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/><persName n="Cochrane,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00369" reg="nearbymention:Cochrane,John,,,"><surname>Cochrane</surname></persName> was here, walle the <rs>Convention</rs> which took <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> out of the <rs>Union</rs> was in session.--He had been sent, or he came of his own accord, to prevent that consummation if possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>Had he been in Yankeedom, his task would have been easy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>He would have bribed the members, and stopped the proceedings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>But he was out of his element.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>He was among honest men; and rogues, simply because they believe that all men are rascals, never know how to deal with honest men. Debarred from his natural expedient, he tried every other at his command.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>He lied, flattered, and wheedled; but it was of no avail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>He could produce no impression.--The State went out, and he went home. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/> During the sojourn of <persName n="Cochrane,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00370" reg="nearbymention:Cochrane,John,,,"><surname>Cochrane</surname></persName>, the friends of a distinguished secessionist understanding that he had just arrived, and taken lodgings at the <rs type="place">Exchange Hotel</rs>, determined to give him a serenade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>It was done, the gentleman made an appropriate speech, and <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> voices were raised for <persName n="Cochrane,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00371" reg="nearbymention:Cochrane,John,,,"><surname>Cochrane</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>Thereupon up popped <persName n="Cochrane,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00372" reg="nearbymention:Cochrane,John,,,"><surname>Cochrane</surname></persName>, and made the most <hi rend="italics">ultra Southern speech</hi> of that ultra Southern season, sitting down amidst vociferous cheers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>He maintained that the <rs>North</rs> neither would nor could make war upon the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>That no Northern army could ever march upon such a crusade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>That the <rs>Northern Democracy</rs> would render it impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>That they would meet any such army at home, upon Northern soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>That the gutters of New York would run with blood, if it were attempted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>That the <rs>Northern Democracy</rs> would expend the last dollar and the last life in defence of their Southern brethren in such a conjunction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>A few days afterwards, his mission having failed, he went home.--When <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> had seceded, his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> act was highly characteristic, and precisely such as might have been expected from him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>His intellect was vigorous, and his opinions, maturely and deliberately formed, were adhered to with a firmness and consistency which were characteristic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>When the present struggle commenced, he threw his whole soul into the <rs>Southern</rs> cause, with an earnestness and persistence which never faltered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>Born to the prospect of affluence and with the present means of gratifying every wish, he did not hesitate a Monroeton relinquishing all these allurements, and turned not only without a murmur, but with cheerfulness to encounter the exposure, the privations and the dangers of an active military life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>The final success of the cause to which he had devoted himself, a cause which he believed had commenced in justice to terminate in glory, was his talisman against every temptation, his encouragement and support under everything like weariness or despondency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>Without parade, or hoist, or threat, but with stern determination, and an inflexibility of purpose which knew no pause but in victory or death, he trod the path of duty, and when the last order came which summoned him to the fatal field, he received it with a brow as unblanched, a spirit as high and undaunted as when in the opening month of the war he went forth to fire the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> hostile gun upon the <rs>Virginia</rs> waters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>On the morning of the <dateStruct value="-05-6"><day reg="6">6th</day> of <month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct> it became necessary, in his opinion, to mount a breastwork to reconnoitre the ground that he might select a position for an entitling battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/> The hand of friendship falters and almost fails in the attempt to portray the features of his private life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>He held you by a spell which sprang from no artifice, for &#x0022;his virtues were his only arts.&#x0022; His very presence gave a glow of satisfaction to those who loved him.--He was to them a portion of life; they drew no picture, formed no plan, in which he did not have a conspicuous part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>There never breathed a man of larger heart or kindlier hand in all things and at all times he displayed a noble generosity, and a munificent charity scarcely bounded by his means, and yet so unostentatious that it was only betrayed by its lavishness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>And all these charms were heightened and vivified by an earnest and vital piety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>In his military life he was peculiarly noxious for the spiritual welfare of his men. He spoke of them and to them with the tenderest affection, and he found his reward less in their bravery than in their good morals and correct department.--They obeyed the officer because they respected and loved the man, and they, and all who knew him, must ever cherish the example which taught them how to live and how to die. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>Even in childhood he exhibited a sedateness and propriety which was truly remarkable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>In his youth there was a gravity and decorum, and, better still, a moral heroism, as rare as they were beautiful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>His boyish associates all united in the declaration that no temptation could seduce him from what he regarded as the course of propriety and honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>In ordinary matters he was modest, even to difference; but in every moral exigency, whether as boy or man, he proved that he was afraid of nothing but of doing wrong &mdash; always intent to anticipate every wish of a devoted widowed mother, to whom he never gave <num value="1">one</num> pang but in his illness, his danger, and his death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>He had an eager thirst for knowledge, was a proficient in many branches of learning, and loved them all. His nature, though serious and thoughtful, was not touched by gloom or isolation of feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>The Doric simplicity and strength of his character stood forth distinct, but not separate, from his kind, of which he was at once the ornament and model.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>He attracted the admiration of every class of society because in everything great or small, he acted steadily from principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>There were none freer from human folbles &mdash; for it he ever wavered men did not perceive the oscillation &mdash; they only recognized the firm, steady, equal step onward and upward, and predicted that he would fulfill all hope, admitting him less for what he had already done than for what he was yet to accomplish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>His deep and earnest convictions impelled him to leave all the enjoyments of an ample fortune and high social position, and with every mild or virtue, every disposition to make and he made happy in domestic life &mdash; all these were abandoned for a long and ordnance service, whose every requisition he discharged without claiming it as a merit or feeling it as a burden.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>Always serene and intrepid his last act was to aid his <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs> in serving a gun which had been temporarily abandoned.--He received his death wound whilst performing this crowning act of <sic>countancy</sic>, which during his whole service had been exhibited alike in the maintenance of discipline and in his readiness to culture privations, to support fatigue, and to en- <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> counter danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>His uncorrupted purity of mind received its finishing grace in an humble, devout reliance upon the truths and promises of Christianity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>In his last moments he said, &#x0022;I have never believed in a death had repentance; so, for <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> I have every night, before retiring, earnestly prayed to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, not so much that he would spare my life as that he prepare me for this day and save my soul &#x0022; Comforting words of a brave, honest, sincere heart, recalling <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00395" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> and <persName n="Havelock,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00396" reg="mostcommon:Havelock,nomatch:0"><surname>Havelock</surname></persName>. </p>
