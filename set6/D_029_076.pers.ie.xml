<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> The occasional execution of a <orgName n="Confederate Officer" type="org">Confederate officer</orgName> (alleged to be a spy) in the <rs>Northern</rs> cities affords the masses at home an opportunity of seeing the death-struggles of a rebel, which could in no other way be gratified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>It is not enough to read in the newspapers of killing the scoundrels, &#x0022;way down <placeName reg="South River, Georgia, United States" key="tgn,2681709">South</placeName>,&#x0022; but, by this new process, every man at home can have the banquet served up at his own table, and feast his own delicate senses upon the luxury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>A nice young man, son of <num value="1">one</num> of the &#x0022;F. F. V.'s,&#x0022; if possible, in the morning of his existence, with a calm, determined face and a refined intellectual cast of features (as some of the newspapers describe it), hung up like a dog upon some trumpery charge, is a tit-bit for the <num value="1000000">million</num> which each man can roll, like a sweet morsel, under his tongue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/><persName n="Dix,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Dix,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Dix</surname></persName>, who is entitled to the chief credit of bringing home to all classes of Northern society this cheap and popular luxury, must be considered a public benefactor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>He may have borrowed the idea from the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> Emperors, who used to entertain the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> populace with the spectacle of captive enemies brought from distant climes, and put to death before the eyes of the assembled multitudes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>But the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Romans</rs> were barbarous, and compelled the miserable prisoners to fight each other, or to fight wild beasts, and to perish sword in hand, whereas <persName n="Dix,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Dix,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Dix</surname></persName> works them off in the scientific and humane method of Newgate, and gives the public a fine political and moral lesson, calculated to invigorate their patriotism and refine their hearts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> <persName n="Dix,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Dix,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Dix</surname></persName>, who now occupies a position in the administration of Federal justice like that of <persName n="Dennis,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Dennis,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Dennis</surname></persName>, in Barnaby Rudge,--that is to say, chief hangman of that Government, --gave no promise in his former life of the peculiar eminence which he has now attained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>He was a very sedate and exemplary person, <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> figuring in church assemblies, and prominent at prayer-meetings, and as quiet and contemplative as a cat on a hearthrug before a good fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>He was not a soldier by profession, but as meek and merciful a creature as man ever set eyes on. It is possible that, even now, he is not gratifying any inherent taste for blood; but, by some subtle casuistry, has reconciled his conscience to the deeds he is performing, and really thinks he is doing his duty to <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Well, we are all apt to judge ourselves with great lenity, and to take it for granted that our final <rs type="role2">Judge</rs> looks at our actions through our eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>But an error on that point may be fatal, and if <persName n="Dix,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Dix,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Dix</surname></persName> has been hanging innocent men, not because he had sufficient evidence of their guilt, but because he was afraid of the wrath of the <rs>Northern</rs> mob, his professions of piety and long prayers will fail to secure a verdict of &#x0022;Not Guilty&#x0022; for himself when he stands arraigned at the last tribunal for Murder. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> In reading the record of such crimes against <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and humanity as the enemy have perpetrated in this war, <num value="1">one</num> is tempted to wonder that the thunders of Divine justice do not descend at once from the <name>Heavens</name> and crush the guilty perpetrators in the very commission of their wickedness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>We do not complain of the &#x0022;horrors of war,&#x0022; as war is conducted by civilized nations, under the recognized principle that each belligerent is to fight in his country's cause with all his strength, but that any annoyance, suffering and slaughter by which no ultimate advantage can be gained is a useless piece of barbarity.--But we appeal to the civilized world, we humbly appeal to that Great Tribunal at which all men must <num value="1">one</num> day appear and render an account of the deeds done in the body, that the deliberate system of robbery, rapine, murder, starvation and burning, now carried on against this people, is not war, but a gigantic crime against humanity and against <name n="God" type="God">God</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> Our readers will recollect the scene in <placeName reg="Columbia, Richland, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013641">Columbia</placeName>, where <num value="4000">four thousand</num> people were turned out of doors amidst roaring flames, and the communion vessels of a church were plundered and used in their orgies by drunken soldiers, blaspheming, as they drank, the name of <persName n="Christ,,Jesus,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="default:Christ,Jesus,,,"><foreName>Jesus</foreName> <surname>Christ</surname></persName>; and the later scene, in <placeName reg="Winnsboro, Fairfield, South Carolina" key="tgn,2096961">Winnsboro</placeName>', where, as the church was burning, they sang blasphemous songs to the organ amid the sea of fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Men wonder, when they read such accounts, that Heaven itself does not interpose, and, by some signal interposition of its vengeance, mark its sense of the crime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>But that is not <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> ordinary mode of dealing with man. In the dispensations of His <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, &#x0022;sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily.&#x0022; Men are treated as free agents, which they could not be if every step the transgressor took thrust him at once upon the thick bosses of Jehovah's buckler.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>He has told them that, &#x0022;after death, the judgment&#x0022;; and because He knows how fearful that judgment will be, He waits with wonderful patience and benignity, exhausting the treasures of his goodness and long-suffering to bring them, if possible, to repentance, before he summons them to a bar where the voice of Mercy is no longer heard, and Justice condemns the guilty to pay, to the uttermost farthing, the long arrears of their crime. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> But as nations have no hereafter, and must hence be punished here for their wickedness; and as the <rs>North</rs>, in the re-election of <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, has deliberately sanctioned his mode of conducting this war, those of its people who have any belief in a <name n="God" type="God">God</name> cannot look to the future of their country without some dismal forebodings. &#x0022;With that measure ye mete to others, it shall be meted to you again,&#x0022; is as true of nations as individuals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>We are aware that the <rs>North</rs> is now exempt from calamities and misery; that it flourishes like a green bay tree, and riots in wealth, luxury and licentiousness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>But who knows that, amid its revelry, the hand- writing will not soon appear upon the wall: <q>&#x0022;<name n="God" type="God">God</name> hath numbered thy Kingdom and finished it.&#x0022;</q> Who can say that the groans of helpless sufferers, the smoke of burning cities, the innocent blood crying from the ground, which daily ascend to the throne of the <rs>Most High</rs>, will not <num value="1">one</num> day come down in storms of fire, and blood, and anguish, upon the <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> heads of a guilty people?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>How and when we know not; but unless all history is a lie, unless the existence of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> is a dream of the imagination, there is a future awaiting that nation so full of horror and agony that even we, who are the victims of their crime, could not look upon without a shudder. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> We know how, in their impenetrable armor of self-complacency and atheism, they scoff at such a prediction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>But what is now a prediction will as surely be come history as the sun rises to- morrow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>There is, there must be, a just Governor of the <name>Universe</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Before Him we lay our cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>It may be His will that we perish by murderous hands, and if it be, we bow with reverence and adoration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>But from our desolate homes, our churches defiled, and our bloody graves, there goes up <unclear></unclear> which Heaven will hear and will not disregard. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> Some of our contemporaries publish a statement that <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, in conversation with a lady in <placeName reg="Fayetteville, Cumberland, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014292">Fayetteville</placeName>, said that if the results of his late visitation of the <rs>South</rs> did not restore its people to loyalty, he should, on his next invasion, burn every house to the ground, and if that did not work a cure he would put all the inhabitants to death, without regard to age or sex. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> If anything were necessary to render his next visitation a rather more difficult <num value="1">one</num> than the last, this timely announcement has secured that result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>He never could have advanced far into <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> if the inhabitants had laid waste the country before him as he traveled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Even <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> quailed in his march upon <placeName reg="Moscow, Fayette, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100492">Moscow</placeName> when he saw that the people were acting upon a maxim once announced by himself, that &#x0022;an army cannot exist among ruins.&#x0022; <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> is not <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Nor have our own countrymen, we admit, acted, as yet, with the desperation of Russians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>But <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> has now furnished them the incentives to that desperation, and if their houses are to be burned, they will burn them themselves, and make the country a desert before him. If the men, women and children are to be put to death, they will prefer to die with arms in their hands rather than be shot down like dogs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The common instincts of humanity render that much certain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>And it is equally clear that, when prudential reasons against retaliation have been thus summarily removed, retaliation will at last begin in earnest, and when <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> comes as &#x0022;a savage,&#x0022; as he promises, he will be met by savages, who will make no farther appeal to civilization, but quietly accept the wild-beast issue which is forced upon them by the invaders. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> It really seems as if the mode of conducting this war had been shaped for no other purpose than to render a restoration of the old Union impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Suppose that a policy had been adopted of conducting the war according to the usages of civilized people; that the <rs>Federal</rs> armies had contented themselves with fighting <orgName n="Confederate Armies" type="org">Confederate armies</orgName>, and taking every military advantage for putting down &#x0022;the rebellion,&#x0022; but at the same time had respected private property; had neither burned dwelling-houses nor mills; had interfered in no way with any peaceful non-combatant; had permitted no outrages to men nor insults to women, but had relied solely upon their superior military strength, and the skill of their generals, and the valor of their troops, to end the war!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>We do not say this would have satisfied the malignity of the people; but if the object of the war was the restoration of the <rs>Union</rs>, would not this have been the most efficient means?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Is it not obvious either that the war was intended for no such purpose, or that whatever was intended, the mode of conducting it could have no other effect than to render such an event impossible?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>After what has occurred for <num value="4">four</num> long years, the future unity of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> is a dream of maniacs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>He protested against rushing into this enormous expense for the defence of <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/><rs type="role">Mr.</rs> d'israeli replied to <persName n="Foster,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Foster,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Foster</surname></persName>, and was followed by John Bright, who openly avowed that <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> cannot defend <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>, and that the only way to keep it, is to appeal to the magnanimity and forbearance of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>He said if there really was a party in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> hostile to <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, the temptation to enter into a war was particularly strong, for it was well known to every statesman and public man in both countries that &#x0022;there is no power in the <name>United Kingdom</name> to defend the territory of <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName> successfully against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.&#x0022; At the same time, he challenged the strictest investigation to point to a single word that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> has spoken or written, or a single act that he has done, betraying anger or ill-feeling towards <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>. <measure n="4years" type="date">Four years</measure> ago, he said, when <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> was taken, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> had been acknowledged as belligerents, at a time when <persName n="Adams,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Adams,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName> was expected, as Minister, daily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>He, in fact, arrived that day, and the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing he saw in the newspapers next morning was the proclamation of neutrality and the acknowledgment of belligerent rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Neither of these measures ought to have been adopted until <persName n="Adams,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Adams,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName> had arrived and been waited on, &#x0026;c.; and the not waiting for his arrival was an unfriendly act, which gave great comfort at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, &#x0026;c. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>[It was, by-the-bye, in the <orgName n="House of Lords" type="government">House of Lords</orgName> that this sentiment was uttered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>According to him, there never was so just, so upright, so honorable, a government as that at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, except that in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The <num value="2">two</num> are paragons, which it would not be possible to match.

Both sides complained of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> because she would not take part with either, but had remained strictly neutral.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>There was no fear, he said, that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> would give any cause of offence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>However, he was in favor of putting <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName> in a posture of defence, since that was the most certain mode of preserving the peace.--He was persuaded the tone of moderation which had prevailed in that debate would be of the greatest service in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, &#x0026;c. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/> It is impossible not to be struck with the subdued tone of these speeches, as well as of the <rs>English</rs> press generally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/> &#x0022;On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>, the enemy advanced up the <placeName reg="Military">Military</placeName> road to within <placeName><distance reg="1mile">one mile</distance> of the <rs>Boydton</rs></placeName> plankroad, threw up entrenchments on either side, built a large fort at the <rs type="place">Lewis house</rs>, and pushed forward a body of troops to within a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> of the plankroad. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/> &#x0022;On <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct>, this column was attacked by our troops and driven back our vanguard entering, and, for a time, holding the fort at the <rs type="place">Lewis house</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>Not receiving immediate or sufficient support, the fort was yielded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>After driving the enemy thus far, with beautiful success, our troops fell back a short distance and offered battle, but the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> declined to accept it, and failed even to make any pursuit. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/> &#x0022;The fighting in the vicinity of <persName n="Hatcher,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00262" reg="mostcommon:Hatcher,nomatch:0"><surname>Hatcher</surname></persName>'s run on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time> was quite severe for a while, and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> suffered heavily. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/> &#x0022;Yesterday morning, the enemy's cavalry were ascertained to be approaching the &#x0022;<placeName reg="Five Forks, Dinwiddie, Virginia" key="tgn,2111769">Five Forks</placeName>,&#x0022; on the White-oak road, leading from the plankroad, near <placeName reg="Burgess's mill">Burgess's mill</placeName>, across to the <orgName n="Southside Railroad" type="railroad">Southside railroad</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>This point is about midway between these <num value="2">two</num> points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>This column had passed around our works, and was confidently making for the railroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>But a lion was found in their path in the person of <persName n="Lee,General,Fitz,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00263" reg="default:Lee,Fitz,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Fitz</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> and his brave troopers.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/> &#x0022;Just beyond <placeName reg="Burgess's mill">Burgess's mill</placeName>, and to the southeast, skirmishing commenced early in the day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>The discharges of artillery and the volleys of musketry could be distinctly heard in the city &mdash; the former, at times, very heavy; and the latter, with occasional intervals, almost incessant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>While we have the gratifying intelligence that all was well with us, we are yet unable to give any official account of the fighting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>We held our own, and the enemy gained no advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>Between <time value="2">2</time> and <time value="4pm">4 o'clock P. M.</time>, the heaviest fighting occurred, and at sunset the firing still continued, but was changed both in direction and severity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>It was evident, from the direction of the firing late in the afternoon, and that of an earlier hour, that the <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> enemy had either been driven back, or had changed the point of attack &mdash; most probably the latter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/> &#x0022;It is stated that some <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="600" type="prisoners">six hundred prisoners</measure> were captured.

All the prisoners, and several deserters who came over to us, assert this fact. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/> &#x0022;Both prisoners and deserters state that the enemy's intention is to strike the <orgName n="Southside Railroad" type="railroad">Southside railroad</orgName>--probably at the junction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>These statements are so uniform as to cause some credence to be placed in them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>The prisoners state their loss to be very heavy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/> &#x0022;It is supposed that the battle will be renewed to-day unless the enemy intrenches and assumes the defensive.&#x0022; </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/> The resolutions adopted by Congress in relation to donations to the <name>Treasury</name> seem to require from this Department something more than the mere official promulgation thereof. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/> In the struggle for independence it has pleased Almighty <name n="God" type="God">God</name> to expose our constancy and fortitude to severe trials.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>Through His divine permission, the enemy has obtained many important advantages, and is gathering his strength for a supreme effort for our subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>In these perilous circumstances, while placing our whole trust and confidence in Him, we are loudly called upon by every consideration of wisdom and patriotism to bring forth the entire strength and resources of the country to meet the approaching struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>Among the deficiencies that are felt is the inadequacy of the public revenue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>There is neither dishonor nor danger in making this frank avowal to an intelligent and patriotic people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>They will understand the difficulty, if not impossibility, of executing financial schemes in our present circumstances, and be willing to bear the trials that result as part of the cost of that liberty for which they have so freely shed their blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>Reposing with confidence upon these acknowledged sentiments of the people, Congress wisely levied a heavy tax for the present year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>The revenue from this source, however, is necessarily unequal to the whole demands of the year; nor can the collection thereof be effected in time for immediate wants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>The Treasury must, consequently, continue for some time to be straitened, and the public creditor to be more or less inconvenienced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>Under these circumstances, it was not deemed incompatible with the public dignity to accept the free-will offerings of a generous and patriotic people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>Such contributions are accordingly encouraged by the resolutions of Congress. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/> This suggestion, though prompted by motives of patriotism and generosity, is equally recommended by considerations of interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>The public creditor will not fail to perceive that the principles of honor involved in the fulfillment of contracts will derive a new and more generous impulse when combined with sentiments of gratitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>His gift will be literally twice blessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>In giving to the <name>Treasury</name> he will impart more value to the portion he retains than was abstracted by his gift.
