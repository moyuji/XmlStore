<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> To this question we answer never.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>They may be indifferent spectators of the torrents of blood which have flowed, are now flowing, and will hereafter flow in this terrible war but they know their own interest far too well, and are disposed to follow it far too closely ever to permit are union fraught with a danger to them, which is greater than all the other dangers combined with which they are or can be threatened <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, with that keen sagacity for which she is so remarkable where her own interests are concerned, discovered this danger soon after she had acknowledged our independence, and the early history of the <rs>Union</rs> is filled with accounts of <name>British</name> intrigues to break it up. In this she very nearly succeeded during the war of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>, when at least half the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were disposed to throw off their allegiance and unite with <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName> and would have actually done so had the proper occasion over offered. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> Let us for a moment reflect what would be the inevitable consequences of a reconstruction and then we shall be able to understand how powerful are the motives of the great Powers for not punishing it. The Union at the last census, (<dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>) to the best of our recollection contained about <num value="28600000">28,600,000</num> of inhabitants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>From the time of its establishment it had always doubled its population every <measure n="23years" type="date">twenty three years</measure>. Supposing it to have <num value="25000000">25,000,000</num> now, (which is a moderate estimate) in <measure n="23years" type="date">twenty three years</measure> from this time &mdash; that is to say in <dateStruct value="1886--"><year reg="1886">1886</year></dateStruct>, it will <num value="50000000">number 50,000,000</num>, in <dateStruct value="1909--"><year reg="1909">1909</year></dateStruct>, <num value="100000000">100,000,000</num>, and in <dateStruct value="1932--"><year reg="1932">1932</year></dateStruct>, <num value="200000000">200,000,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Only think of a single nation of <num value="200000000">200,000,000</num> of men, descendants of <rs n="European" type="group">Europeans</rs>, and civilized after the <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> fashion!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The bale array of figures makes the brain reel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>In <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> the proportion of the standing army to the population is <num value="1">one</num> to <num value="50">fifty</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The proportion would not be less in this restored Union, and the world would behold the astounding spectacle of a standing army reaching the enormous figure of <num value="4000000">four millions</num> of men &mdash; What power could resist such an army what nation would dare to assert its most indubitable rights in presence of it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>It must be recollected, too, that from this time forward the policy of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government is to be highly aggressive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>It designs to go on conquering until nothing shall be left for its arms to be tried upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>It hates <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> with a deadly battered, and it has not much more love for <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> than it has for <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>It hates the former because it has not openly taken up arms in its favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>It hates the latter because it has treated the <rs>Monroe</rs> doctrine with contempt and taken possession of <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> in denounce of its threats and remonstrances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Let the <rs>Union</rs> be restored, and <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> will be driven from <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, while <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> may had it impossible to hold <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>. </p>
