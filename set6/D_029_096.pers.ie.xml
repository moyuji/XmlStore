<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/> <persName n="Howard,Major-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00088" reg="mostcommon:Howard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major-General">Major-General</roleName> <surname>Howard</surname></persName> has just received the official report of <persName n="Brown,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00089" reg="mostcommon:Brown,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Assistant-Commissioner">Assistant Commissioner</rs> of the <rs type="place">Freedmen's Bureau</rs> for the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName>, relative to the operations of the system in that State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>The report is prefaced by a reference to the condition of society in the <rs>State</rs> when he assumed charge of his office: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/> The problem to be solved was how to provide for the protection, elevation and government of nearly half a <num value="1000000">million</num> of people suddenly freed from the bonds of a rigorous control, acquainted with no law but that of force, ignorant of the elementary principles of civil government and of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> duties of citizenship, without any provision for the future wants of themselves and families, and entertaining many false and extravagant notions in respect to the intentions of the <rs>Government</rs> toward them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/> The citizens generally afforded no assistance in meeting these difficulties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>Stripped to a great extent of ready resources by the operations of the war, they were unable to allow these people their just dues, much less any charitable assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>In some sections of the <rs>State</rs> public meetings had been held, and the citizens had entered into covenant not to pay more than <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">five dollars</measure> (<measure n="5dollars" type="currency">$5</measure>) per month to able-bodied men, not to rent lands to the freedmen, nor to give employment to any without a certificate from their former owners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>Many of the citizens, under the control of tradition, habit and education, only sullenly acquiesced in the freedom of their former slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>They regarded the colored population as necessarily and appropriately servile and unfit for freedom; and stimulated by the feeling that the late slaves were in some way responsible for the failure of their cause, they were wholly disqualified from co-operating in the work of the bureau. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/> Another class, numerically small, but of the best talent, culture, and influence, not only accepted the situation, but with a wise fore-sight and noble patriotism were ready to co-operate with the <rs>Government</rs> for the speediest restoration of tranquillity and law, and to assist the bureau in its endeavor to bring the highest good to all classes out of present evils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/><num value="0.33">A <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num>, and more numerous class, because forced to acknowledge the freedom of their former slaves, wished either to effect their entire removal from the <rs>State</rs> or bind them by such contracts as would allow them but little more freedom than they formerly possessed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/> The superintendents were further instructed to protect the negroes in their rights as freemen, to see that they were not in any way oppressed by their former masters, and to cultivate friendly relations between the <num value="2">two</num> classes; to assist in the organization and maintenance of schools; to discourage as far as possible the disposition of the freedmen to remove from <num value="1">one</num> locality to another, except so far as it might be necessary for uniting members of separated families, or to find profitable employment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>To urge upon them the importance of making contracts for their labor, and to fulfill the same when made; to aid them by their advice when necessary to prevent their being defrauded; but in all other cases to leave them free to make their own bargains. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/> To furnish rations, medicine and medical attendance for the helpless and destitute not provided for by their former owners; but not to issue rations to persons able to work, for whom employment could be found. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/> The late slaves have been fully protected in their rights as freedmen, and the exceptional instances where their rights were for a time denied are no longer-heard of. It is believed that there is not within the <rs>State</rs> a person who does not understand and successfully assert his rights to freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>The extraordinary eagerness of the freedmen for the advantages of schools has been met as far as the resources of the bureau and the charitable zeal of its friends abroad would allow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>There are about <num value="11500">eleven thousand five hundred</num> pupils receiving instruction from <num value="195">one hundred and ninety-five</num> teachers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>Numerous and urgent appeals come from remote and isolated localities for teachers and books, to which it has been impossible to respond for want of school-rooms and suitable quarters for teachers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>Their progress in learning is such as would warrant a much larger expenditure of money and effort.--Many citizens, adhering to the ideas and customs of the past, strongly oppose these movements, while others endorse and encourage them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>The sentiment of the community is gradually changing in favor of educating the freedmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>The irritation existing between the whites and the freedmen immediately after the cessation of hostilities has greatly abated, and instances of personal violence are becoming rare. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>The commissioner represents that he has charge of <measure n="56000acres" type="area">56,000 acres</measure>, held as confiscated or abandoned lands. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/> The rights of the freedmen in the crops and improvements on the land restored have been secured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>The result of the cultivation of these lands by the freedmen is not yet known, as the crops have not been fully harvested, but it is believed to be satisfactory. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/> The special courts organized for the freedmen are successfully accomplishing the ends aimed at in their establishment, and are giving general satisfaction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>By them justice has been more generally received than could have been done by any other available means. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/> Notwithstanding the many embarrassments under which the bureau has labored, it is believed to have succeeded in promoting the welfare of the class in whose interest it was created, and to have afforded important aid in securing good order in the <rs>State</rs>. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/> This is a very strong statement of the condition of the blacks when they fell into the hands of the <rs type="place">Bureau</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>He states, with rather the air of complaint, that the citizens generally afforded no assistance in meeting the &#x0022;difficulties&#x0022; presented by the negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>Yet he answers his own complaint by confessing immediately afterwards, that, being &#x0022;stripped, to a great extent, of their resources by the operations of the war, they were unable to allow these people their just dues, much less any charitable assistance.&#x0022;--Had he made the expression stronger &mdash; had he stated that the people were stripped of nearly everything: all their money; all their valuables; their horses and cattle; nearly all their provisions; and had not enough to supply their own wants, to relieve their own sufferings, he would not have exceeded the fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>Yet, these people must have assisted the blacks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>For how else did they live?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>They did not, it is true, assist those who rushed to the camps and the cities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>The people of this State know the negro better than any other &mdash; they know his capacity and his wants, and can now take care of him better, and settle him down in his new relation with as much consideration for his welfare, and more forecast and judgement than any of those persons in other States who are making him their everlasting topic &mdash; and the everlasting cause of accusation and vituperation of the people of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>When is this sort of warfare to cease?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>Are we never to have rest?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>Is it not enough that the slave, originally imported by Northern men in Northern ships and sold to the <rs>South</rs>, is set free?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>Is it not enough that we, submitting to results, are struggling in earnestness and sincerity, as well as in poverty, to restore plenty and order to the land &mdash; that order and plenty without which there is no rest, no satisfaction, no support for <rs type="color">white</rs> or <rs type="color">black</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>Is it not enough that we submit to the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the laws, and have solemnly and irrevocably abolished slavery and involuntary servitude from the land?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>Will not all this do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>And must we still be assailed &mdash; our peace and quiet, and the safety and order of the country, disturbed by this execrable crusade?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>What do the people who are enlisted in it desire to do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>Do they wish to continue the breach between the sections?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>Do they wish to perpetuate hate? </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>According to some newspaper reports, it appeared that before the <name>Legislature</name> took a recess it so amended the stay law as to except from its operation any debt contracted since the <date value="04-03">3d April</date> last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>Upon examination, we find the case to stand thus: The Legislature passed, on the <date value="12-19">19th December,</date> an act amending the act of the <name>Legislature</name> which met at <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName> so as to stay the collection of debts during the session of the <name>Legislature</name>, unless sooner repealed or amended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>This brief act made no exceptions, and therefore applied to all debts to the present time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/><lb/>Prospect of the success of the <rs>President</rs>'s policy.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/> There are strong indications that Congress will re-assemble on the <date value="01-09">9th of January</date> (for, practically, the recess will-last till then,) in a better frame of mind as regards the admission of the <rs>Southern</rs> members.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>There is an open rebellion in the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> camp against the exclusive policy of <persName n="Stevens,Mister,Thaddeus,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00126" reg="default:Stevens,Thaddeus,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Thaddeus</foreName> <surname>Stevens</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>The elements, sufficient to defeat that policy in the <rs type="place">House</rs>, already exist there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>All that is wanted is a leader for the moderate and conservative <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>If <persName n="Raymond,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00127" reg="mostcommon:Raymond,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Raymond</surname></persName> will assume that position, it will be cheerfully conceded to him. But he must <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> come out boldly and strongly in defence of the <rs>President</rs>'s policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>If he will not do so, some other leader will be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>The Southern members of Congress have only gone home to spend the <name>Christmas</name> holidays.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>They will all be here again by the middle of <dateStruct value="-01-"><month reg="01">January</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>Before the adjournment of Congress, they had an interview with the <rs>President</rs>, and he gave them such encouragement as leads them to believe that they will all be admitted before the close of this session, and some of them, those from <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName> and <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, at a very early period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>Soon after the <date value="01-09">9th of January</date> an attempt will be made to refer the credentials of these members to the <rs>Committee</rs> on Elections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>If this attempt is successful, the battle, is won; for that committee will report favorably to their admission, and the action of the <rs type="place">House</rs> will be sure to sustain the committee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>The late message of the <rs>President</rs> and the report of <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00128" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>, by which it was supported, have contributed much to bring about this result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>All of the moderate and conservative <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> now say that the question bears a different aspect than it did before that message was sent in. They cannot, they say, at the mere dictation of <persName n="Stevens,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00129" reg="nearbymention:Stevens,Thaddeus,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stevens</surname></persName>, overlook and set at nought a state paper of such gravity, emanating from the executive branch of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>Before this message there might have been a question as to the status of these States; but there can be none now. Such was the tone of many of the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> before they left for their homes, and there can be no doubt that they will come back in the same frame of mind. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>Would it, if made, be conclusive?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>Suppose that after his escape from prison he had knocked down a man, maltreated and robbed him, and that his surrender was demanded, would the <rs>French Government</rs> be entitled to refuse it on the ground that, though he might have stolen <measure n="1000l." type="pounds"><num value="1000">one thousand</num> pounds</measure> and left its owner half dead, yet, in the eye of the law, treason was a higher crime than robbery and maiming, and there was no arrangement for the surrender of traitors, his case did not come within the extradition treaty?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>The French Government has, we presume, only to do with the offence on which a demand is founded, and, satisfied that that offence has been committed, we doubt if it would be empowered to shelter him on the plea pretended.
