<head>Incidents of the fight.</head> <opener> <dateline> <name type="place">Newmarket, Va.,</name> <date value="1862-04-05">April 5, 1862.</date> </dateline> </opener> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> Several accounts of this memorable day have already been given, but as the lapse of time is required to acquaint the reader with the full and true account of all battles, we think it nothing amiss to give another description of our famous struggle at <placeName key="tgn,7017708" n="1.000 36" reg="winchester, winchester, virginia">Kernstown</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>We will, therefore, mention briefly a few incidents of this remarkable occurrence, and leave the seat to the experienced historian. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> <date value="03-23">On the morning of the 23d of March,</date> we were ordered from camp at a very early hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>After traveling a distance of <measure n="18miles" type="distance">18 miles</measure>, and about midday, we heard a loud and repeated cannonading in our front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>A closer approach assured us that it was our pickets contending with those of the enemy, and that the enemy was not for distant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>We were marched off the road a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> to our left, where we remained till <time value="3pm">3 o'clock P. M.</time>, when the cannonading and bombardment informed us that the time for action was drawing nigh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The movements of the enemy having at length conditioned the battle-ground upon our left, <num value="1">one</num> by <num value="1">one</num> the batteries and regiments were seen making their way to the glorious struggle for liberty or death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Soon the echoes of musketry were heard ascending the mountain summit as our brave boys marched boldly up to the enemy's front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Never, perhaps, did Southerners stand more firmly, or fight more courageously under more discoursing circumstances, than did our little band in this <rs n="Battle of Kernstown" type="battle">battle of Kernstown</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>For <num value="6">six</num> long hours they contended with at least <num value="5">five</num> times their own numbers; yet, till the order was announced from the lips of our gallant <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Thomas,G.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> himself, did they dare to leave the field, or despair of victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Whilst every regiment doubtless acted its part well in this engagement, yet we could not but take particular cognizance of the acts of bravery that marked and distinguished those of the <orgName type="regiment" key="3Brigade">Third Brigade</orgName>, commanded by <persName n="Burks,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Burks,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Burks</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Never before having had an opportunity of displaying their valor, they seemed anxious for the hour when they, too, might share a blow in their country's cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>For <num value="7">seven</num> long months they traversed the mountains of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Northwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName>, subsisted upon scanty supplies, and performed many hard and toilsome marches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Thus hardened to their country's service, they cared but little for the life they once held so dear, and seemed even enraged at the cannon's roar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Led on by their dauntless commander, they marched forward to the battle- ground with stern and expressive countenances, and fought with calm and deliberate energy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>It is useless to say they did execution, for every volley of their musketry is said to have played havoc in the enemy's ranks. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> The last regiment of this brigade that was ordered to the field was the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA42">42d Virginia</orgName>, commanded by <persName n="Langhorne,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Langhorne,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Langhorne</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>When the sun was but an hour high, the battle being in its hottest state, the command was given to the <num value="42" type="ordinal">42d</num> to &#x0022;fall in.&#x0022; They were prompt to orders, and in a few minutes were approaching the bloody field on double-quick time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>They fought with great courage till nightfall, when the whole force, wearied and broken down, were ordered to retire from the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>This regiment was the last that received the order, the last that left the field, and the regiment that closed the retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>And what strikes us so sensibly is that, when left alone upon that dreary night, and apparently deserted by all these brave sons of the Old Dominion, they still stood and bravely fought beneath their floating banner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/><num value="70">Seventy</num> of their number were among the killed, wounded, and missing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The horse of <persName n="Langhorne,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Langhorne,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Langhorne</surname></persName> was shot down on the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>But we cannot dwell here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>We can but say to the boys of the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA42">42d Virginia</orgName>, &#x0022;yo are the remnant of a well fought field.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> did not pursue us further that night, but are said to have spent the night in gathering up their dead and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/><persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Thomas,G.,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> encamped but a few miles from the battle-ground, where he remained till a late hour the following morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>In the morning <num value="1">one</num> of our regiments of infantry was sent back under a flag of truce to bury our dead, but the whistle of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> ball told them in musical terms to let their dead alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>We have not as yet been able to get an accurate account of the enemy's loss in the engagement, but from several reports that have reached us from quite reliable sources, it does not amount to less than <measure n="1500" type="killed, wounded, and missing">1,500 killed, wounded, and missing</measure>, while ours does not exceed <num value="500">500</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The enemy are still advancing up the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>. <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,Thomas,G.,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> has fallen back within <placeName><distance reg="2miles">two miles</distance> of <placeName key="tgn,2540359" n="1.000 8" reg="newmarket, newport news, virginia">Newmarket</placeName></placeName>, where he seems to be making every preparation to give them another warm reception at their next arrival. </p> <closer> <signed><persName n="Mills,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Mills,nomatch:0"><surname>Mills</surname></persName>.</signed> </closer> </div4>
