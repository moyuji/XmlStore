<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/> The successful construction of the canal, of which there can be no doubt, will, it is alleged, enable our gunboats to wholly overcome the formidable obstructions in the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>, and possibly ultimately be the means of their engaging <placeName key="tgn,2295265" n="1.000 14" reg="drewry's bluff, chesterfield, virginia">Fort Darling</placeName> and other rebel strongly- fortified places adjacent to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, and perhaps, before the end comes, operate largely in the reduction of the rebel capital itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>The success which followed the attack threw our men into the best spirits, and every soldier wore a smile of satisfaction upon his countenance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>The result of the attack is highly satisfactory to the officers in command, and is viewed in the most favorable light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>The enemy has been materially weakened by the loss of <num value="3000">three thousand</num> of his best troops taken prisoners and several <measure n="1000" type="killed and wounded">thousand killed and wounded</measure>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>The weather was rainy during the day, and especially so during the afternoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>The fighting was done amidst a series of heavy showers, which not only incommoded our men, but rendered the ground heavy and slippery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>Most of the fighting on our left was done in a dense growth of underbrush and woods. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/> We can form no estimate of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> loss other than the statement of officers that it was very heavy, Many of their dead and wounded fell into our hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>Nor are we able to form an idea of our own loss, as up to night but few of the wounded had been brought from the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>The great majority of those we saw were slightly wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>We shall learn further particulars of the casualties and of the battle to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>We regret to state, however, that <persName n="Clingman,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00161" reg="mostcommon:Clingman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Clingman</surname></persName> was painfully, though not seriously, wounded. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>The battle for the possession of the railroad will probably be resumed this morning, and it is believed the enemy will not only be dislodged, but disastrously defeated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>This expedition will turn out, in the end, to be the greatest disaster that has yet happened to <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00162" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> in this department. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/> Reports from the battle-field, late last evening, represent our forces between the enemy and the main army in front of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>If so, something interesting may occur to-day. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/> As the enemy still hold the railroad, it is impossible to state what damage has been done the track.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>It is believed, that instead of sending a body of raiders across towards the south side, the enemy's cavalry are operating on the <placeName reg="Weldon, Halifax, North Carolina" key="tgn,2077124">Weldon</placeName> road in the rear of the army. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/> We regard the cry which some of the press of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> is raising for peace as fraught with raischief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>Nothing could have a more direct tendency to encourage our enemy to persevere in the iniquitous war he is waging against us without, as far as we can perceive, the slightest disposition to relax or to compromise, even if compromise were possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>But it is not possible, so far as we can see, and so far as boundaries are concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>The Government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> has no right to give up <num value="1">one</num> foot of territory belonging to, or claimed by, any <num value="1">one</num> of the sovereignties whose agent it is.--The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government will not agree, at this time, to make peace without a huge slice from these territories; perhaps, in some instances, without the surrender of whole States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>In <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, it would insist upon claiming what they call New Virginia, in addition to <placeName reg="Old Point, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2557597">Old Point</placeName> and <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>In <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> and <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, they would claim the whole State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>Elsewhere their claims would be based strictly upon the principle of <hi rend="italics"><unclear></unclear></hi> Now, the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> cannot make any such treaty as this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>It cannot cede any territory belonging to any of these States, each <num value="1">one</num> of which is a nation &mdash; a sovereignty as distinct as <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> or <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>It can make peace on no other terms, so far as we can see, than those upon which it has more than once pledged itself &mdash; absolute independence and the complete integrity of all the <name>States</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>When, therefore, we hear people talking about the astuteness of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and the danger there is of their overreaching us, &#x0026;c., we do not understand what they mean. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/> Our people are tired of the war, no doubt, and this is the reason why they are so easily deceived by every thing relating to peace that comes from the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>They ought to understand, if they do not, that there are <num value="2">two</num> parties there, <num value="1">one</num> of which is in and the other out; and that the party which is out is trying to get in. The party which is in is the party which is prosecuting this war. The party which is out, constitutes <num value="2">two</num> parties of the most opposite sentiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/><num value="1">One</num> of them is more hostile to us than <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00256" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>The other <hi rend="italics">affects</hi> to be for peace, and uses the peace cry as a weapon against <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00257" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>If they combine at all, which is extremely doubtful, it will be for the purpose of expelling the present incumbent, (a very difficult job,) and getting possession-of the spoils, which are, beyond computation, enormous, and for no purpose of patriotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>Should they even succeed, which we hold to be nigh akin to a miracle, it is very doubtful whether we should have peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>The present war causes a disbursement of a <num value="1000">thousand</num> <num value="1000000">million</num> a year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>We doubt very much whether there is any party in Yankeedom possessing virtue enough to resist the temptation of handling such a sum; and the successful party must forego all hope of doing so if it put an end to the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/> The <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName>, the other day, advised <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00258" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> to send commissioners to treat of peace without raising the blockade or withdrawing the troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>Of course it knew, and acknowledged that it knew, that such a proposition would not be listened to. But it, of its own accord, explained what it proposed to effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>It was nothing more nor less than a trick &#x0022;to take the wind out of the sails of the <name>Peace</name> party.&#x0022; Every proposition from this quarter partakes more or less of the same character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>Even if we expected anything from the <name>Peace</name> party, which we do not, we should think it not at all advisable to mix up our cause with their proceedings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>If they can really, in any manner whatever, be of service to the establishment of peace, it must be solely on condition that they keep aloof from all correspondence, or association, or suspicion of correspondence or association, with any party in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>The bare suspicion of collusion would destroy their usefulness at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>In that view of the case, we cannot see that the interference of <persName n="Sanders,Mister,George,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00259" reg="default:Sanders,George,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Sanders</surname></persName> and his colleagues is calculated to produce anything short of unalloyed evil. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/> It is humiliating &mdash; we had almost said degrading &mdash; in us to be crying out for peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>We are the party wronged; we are the party assailed; we are the party acting still, and always having acted, on the defensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>The highest authority known to the laws of our country has repeatedly declared that we are ready to make peace as soon as the enemy shall have ceased to make war upon us. What more can we do or say without placing ourselves in the attitude of suppliants to a power which has more than once spurned our offers, even upon subjects not in the least connected with peace?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00260" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> is the man, and the only man, who is authorized by the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs> to appoint commissioners to treat of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>Any proposition from this side, to be of any avail, must be made to <hi rend="italics">him.</hi> And who is prepared to place our country at his footstool, or who does not see that, by doing so, we leave it in his power to prescribe the terms?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>As he himself is the aggressor, by this course we acknowledge him as conqueror.
