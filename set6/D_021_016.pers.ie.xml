<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> <q>&#x0022;Do you call this money?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> Leaning over the counter, a puzzled volunteer was endeavoring to reckon up the change just paid out by the sleek haired clerk Before him lay a quantity of mutilated bills, ragged and dirty pieces of paper, bits of cardboard, printed checks, a few copper pennies, milk tickets, postage stamps, and other interesting specimens of the present outrageous <q>&#x0022;coin of the realm&#x0022;</q> Over and over again the puzzled volunteer essayed to count the pile of villainous currency, and over and over again he failed to find it satisfactory &mdash; It was too much for his rustic arithmetic the problem was too difficult to solve upon only <num value="10">ten</num> fingers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The bystanders laughed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>The money was spread out upon a show case, as young ladies lay cards upon a table in telling fortunes, and the soldier stood before it searchingly examining every piece.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/><q>&#x0022;Do you call this money?&#x0022;</q> he asked, taking up a small, yellow parallelogram looking very like the brass card on the top of a sardine box. <q>&#x0022;Do you call this money?&#x0022;</q> holding up an advertisement of fine <rs n="havana cigars" type="product">Havana cigars</rs>-- <q> &#x0022;And this&#x0022;</q>--a bill for <measure n="15cents" type="currency">15 cents</measure>, in which some weak minded printer had gone raving mad in different kinds of type.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/><q>&#x0022;<hi rend="italics">Good for <num value="1">one</num> shave;</hi> (reading slowly) <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Dick,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Dick,nomatch:0"><surname>Dick</surname></persName>, the <name>Barber</name>--</hi> Do you call this money?&#x0022; </q> The sleek-haired clerk was puzzled also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/><q>&#x0022;It'll pass all over town; indeed it will, sir&#x0022;</q> Once more the soldier scrutinized the ragged and incongruous pile, and grasping it in <num value="1">one</num> hand, soliloquized: <q>&#x0022;So, this is money &mdash; money?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>ha ! I call it stuff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Why, a man might hold his hand full, and then have but <measure n="37.5cents" type="currency">thirty seven and a half cents</measure> money !&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> A few days ago I spoke of the currency in the <q>&#x0022;days of <num value="76">76</num>.&#x0022;</q> Allow me to recapitulate a little for the purpose of going more into detail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>To carry on the revolution colonial bills of credit were issued to the amount of <num value="200">two hundred</num> milions of dollars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>For <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure> this was almost the circulating medium of the country, and was exclusively used in domestic Trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>After a time owing to the presence of the <rs>French</rs> army and trade with Spanish smugglers, specie became plentiful, and the <name>Colonial</name> notes grew valueless and went out of circulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Hundreds of private individuals and companies, especially in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, issued notes upon their own responsibility, and theme, too, became worthless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>No <num value="1">one</num> thought of redeeming them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The whole history of this Continental paper money is a history of au immense front, originating with <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName> speculators, who patriotically shouted <q>&#x0022;down with the <rs>King</rs> !&#x0022;</q> and clamored loudly for revolution and war. As soon as peace was declared the paper issues entirely ceased to circulate &mdash; the specie was sent off to pay for foreign goods, and, the importation being large, the country was soon drained of its <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver --Once</rs> more the people began to cry out for want of change, and many of the <name>States</name> had recourse again to the same wretched expedient to supply themselves with money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>This, after a short time, impoverished the merchant, and embarrassed the planter by driving all the specie beyond his reach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>A shinplaster would not be noticed when coin could be had, and every, possible plan was resorted to <sic>to</sic> keep it in circulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName> tolerated a base practice of allowing people to cut dollars and smaller pieces of silver for the purpose of making change without recourse to paper note of small denominations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/><placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> followed, and speculation soon became the rage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>A piece of silver was cut into <num value="5">five</num> parts, each part passing for <num value="0.25">a quarter</num>, the owner making <num value="1">one</num> by the operation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>When there was no silver to speculate on, everybody went to making paper money again, until the country was completely flooded with vile shinplasters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The consequence was that when foreign trade was established, the <name>States</name> found themselves in an indescribable prostrate condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Half the people were utterly ruined; only the bankers making money. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> The same necessity for change exists now that existed <measure n="80years" type="date">eighty years</measure> ago; there is the same mania for speculation, which if not checked by timely legislation, will be attended by the same results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Hundreds of corporations and even individuals, regardless of the law, are engaged in the pernicious business of issuing private money, not for public convenience, but that profit may accrue Banking has become a rage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The notes of <q>&#x0022;<persName n="Dick,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Dick,nomatch:0"><surname>Dick</surname></persName>, the barber.&#x0022;</q> circulate the same and lie in the same portmanteau beside those of <q>&#x0022;Gunny Rags, the ship chandler&#x0022;</q> <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> is disgustingly full of these personal shinplasters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Men advertise their wares on a bit of paper, sign their names to it, and out it goes as good as <q>&#x0022;legal tender.&#x0022;</q> We have boat money bridge money, river money, road money, store money, and <rs n="dry goods" type="product">dry goods</rs> money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>we have bills <q>&#x0022;good for <num value="1">one</num> copy of the daily <hi rend="italics">Dispatch,</hi>&#x0022;</q> &#x0022;good for <num value="1">one</num> cigar.&#x0022; good for this, than and the other thing, of a market value equal the <unclear></unclear> stamped upon the note.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>All people enquire about is the signature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>A printed piece of paper with a name in the corner, is good &mdash; and I really believe <num value="1">one</num> could pass the label from a bottle of <rs n="olive oil" type="product">olive oil</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Strangers coming here are apt to look with suspicion upon some of the issues that pass perfectly well, and of <num value="10">ten</num> times ask, like the puzzled volunteer mentioned above, <q>&#x0022;do you call this money ?&#x0022;</q> A week's residence, however, cures them of all scrupulous feeling. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> The use of postage stamps is getting some what our of fashion, as they wear out with little handling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>A short time ago the newsboys used them considerably, and were accustomed to give as change stamps from which the gluten had departed, and so dirty that no <num value="1">one</num> could tell whether the figure was intended for <placeName reg="Jeff Davis, Noxubee, Mississippi" key="tgn,2420078">Jeff Davis</placeName> or the eagle-bird.--It was out of the question to use them on a letter unless they were pinned on as the backwoodsman attached his stamp a few years ago. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> When the new <num value="3">three</num>-cent U. S. stamps were <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> put in circulation, a letter was dropped into <num value="1">one</num> of our post-offices that at the time attracted attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>It appeared to have been written with the greatest care; the envelope was nicely ruled, that the address might be perfectly straight; it was sealed to a nicety, and directed in a cramped but careful hand to a Miss in the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Only <num value="1">one</num> thing remained &mdash; a stamp ! The writer was evidently a tyro in the art of paying postage, and his nice, white envelope attested the fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The stamp appeared to have been soaked, and the letter licked from <num value="1">one</num> side to the other.--In vain endeavors to make it stick the stamp had been pressed here and there, leaving in each place a spot of dirt and gluten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The trial seemed to have been a severe <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>But at last the tyro conquered, and running a pin through the letter, stamp and all, wrote underneath, seemingly in a fit of desperation, <q>&#x0022;Paid, if the d &mdash; d thing sticks.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/> <hi rend="italics">Moral</hi>--Beware how you use P. O. stamps for change. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> The fact exists that the country is being rapidly flooded I with shiplasters and worthless personal notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>How the pernicious evil can be stopped I leave wiser heads to determine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>I have spoken of the matter as it exists &mdash; in a spirit of levity, may be &mdash; but nevertheless have called attention to some patent truths, But, joking aside, this is a matter that calls, at least, for an examination, not so much on account of its being a present outrage as on account of the evils it entails upon the future. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> A bout the <rs>Burnside</rs> fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Like <q>&#x0022;his illustrious predecessors,&#x0022;</q> (intended for sarcasm, as <persName n="Ward,,Artemas,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="default:Ward,Artemas,,,"><foreName>Artemas</foreName> <surname>Ward</surname></persName> say,) <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> went to sea in a storm, after allowing <measure n="6weeks" type="date">six weeks</measure> of lovely weather to escape him.

The ocean has been rough and turbulent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>It must have been a musing to have seen the condition of these transports yesterday and day before and to have seen <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> soldiers paying their devoirs to <placeName key="tgn,3000601" n="1.000 10" reg="cape hatteras, dare, north carolina">Hatteras</placeName> as the ship rounded the cape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Old seamen say the storm was very severe outside, and we have been piously hoping that every vessel may go to the bottom before it is over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>If the expedition escapes the <name>Scylla</name> of the sea, it has a Charybdis on land to encounter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>His object in retreating was to entice the enemy into a pursuit as far as Prestonsburg, where he had chosen a strong position, and had he succeeded in reaching it, would have annihilated them; but they were too quick for him, and succeeded in overtaking his rear before the desired position had been reached, when there was no alternative left him but to turn and fight. </p>
