<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>To that circumstance is owing his appointment of jailor-in-chief to the whole <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>A thorough coward, he unites in his own person all the attributes that properly belong to that character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>We read the truth of this in the extravagant proposition of the <rs>Wisconsin Senator</rs>, who proposes to call out a <num value="1000000">million</num> of <measure n="90days" type="date">ninety days</measure> volunteers to march upon <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and capture the prisons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>We see it in the resolution not to treat with our Government here because it is a conspiracy, although it has defied the utmost efforts of Yankeedom for nearly <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>, and repeatedly defeated its largest armies and most celebrated captains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>We read it in the proposition of their Congress to send all its members under <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> of age into the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>We read it in the resolution to fight until &#x0022;all traitors&#x0022; [meaning the whole Confederacy] &#x0022;are conquered into love for the <rs>Union</rs>.&#x0022; Indeed, from all the debates and resolutions of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Congress, we can see that the arrow of contempt which proverbially pierces the shell of the tortoise has penetrated deeply into the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> soul.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/> But the <num value="1000000">million</num> of men &mdash; the <measure n="90days" type="date">ninety days</measure> men &mdash; there lies the rub ! When Yankeedom is scarcely able, under the strong pressure of the draft, to raise <num value="50000">50,000</num> out of <num value="300000">300,000</num>, it seems preposterous to think of raising <num value="20">twenty</num> times that number by volunteering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>How is it to be done?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>Not by merely calling for them, we suppose, and bounties of <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">$1,000</measure> <hi rend="italics">per man</hi> can hardly hold out through such a host.
