<head>The summer campaign.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>The summer campaign has begun auspiciously for the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The battles of the <hi rend="italics"><placeName key="tgn,7017622" n="1.000 715" reg="wilderness, spotsylvania, virginia">Wilderness</placeName></hi> and <hi rend="italics"><placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName></hi> (the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>) have added largely to the renown of the sons of the <rs>South</rs> as a warlike and resolute people, determined to be free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The bold cavalry raid under <persName n="Stoneman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:Stoneman,nomatch:0"><surname>Stoneman</surname></persName> is more than off setted by that under <persName n="Jones,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Jones,nomatch:0"><surname>Jones</surname></persName> and <persName n="Imboden,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Imboden,nomatch:0"><surname>Imboden</surname></persName>.--<persName n="Stoneman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Stoneman,nomatch:0"><surname>Stoneman</surname></persName> did very little injury to the railroads and none to the canal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>He burned some bridges spanning the canal, and a very substantial <num value="1">one</num> at <placeName reg="Elk Island, Goochland, Virginia" key="tgn,2314391">Elk Island</placeName> built by <persName n="Harrison,Mister,Randolph,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="default:Harrison,Randolph,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Randolph</foreName> <surname>Harrison</surname></persName>; but these were all for the accommodation of neighborhood communities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The transportation along the canal is not at all interrupted by anything the raiders did. These facts illustrate the wanton and ruthless spirit of our invaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Driven by <persName n="Lee,,Fitzhugh,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="default:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><foreName>Fitzhugh</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> from <placeName reg="Columbia, Richland, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013641">Columbia</placeName>, where their main feat of diabolism was to have been performed, they attack and destroy the little neighborhood bridges, imitating the mastiff, who, kicked out of the kitchen, falls upon the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> innocent duck that is in his way. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> On the other hand, <persName n="Jones,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Jones,nomatch:0"><surname>Jones</surname></persName> and <persName n="Imboden,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Imboden,nomatch:0"><surname>Imboden</surname></persName> have returned safely with <measure n="600" type="prisoners">600 prisoners</measure> and several <num value="1000">thousand</num> horses and cattle, after having seriously injured the <orgName n="Baltimore and Ohio Railroad" type="railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</orgName> and the <rs type="place">Chesapeake and Ohio Canal</rs>.--They, moreover, penetrated into <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, exciting the wildest alarm lest our men should imitate the vandalism of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> in their invasion of the <rs>South</rs>.--Their raid will certainly offset <persName n="Stoneman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Stoneman,nomatch:0"><surname>Stoneman</surname></persName>'s. --The merit of a raid consists in its destructiveness, and that of our raid makers having done more injury than that of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, of course it is the better raid of the <num value="2">two</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The summer, we repeat, begins auspiciously for our arms in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>What if we loose a good and great man and some of our best troops &mdash; it was the will of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> &mdash; They perished, if they did perish, worthily as they wished, in their country's cause, amidst the shouts of triumph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>But they perished not &mdash; their spirit and example live, and we know that the cause which made such Heroes will continue to vindicate itself to the day of final deliverance! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> In the <rs>Southwest</rs> the combined aquatic and land fights have been all gloriously in our favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>In the skirmishing and man&#x0153;nvring on the land there is merely the premonitory of greater conflicts and imminent events that are to follow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>But in most of these we have had the advantage, and they display the maintenance of the high courage and constancy of the soldier of the <rs>South</rs>, which in the battle-field have made him equal to the immense odds brought against him. The great achievements in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> will cheer up the <rs>Southern</rs> heart, and we hope and believe will be imitated in the <rs>Southwest</rs> by deeds alike honorable to our fame and strengthening to our cause. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The midsummer sun will soon be upon the <rs>South</rs>, and what the enemy does he must do quickly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Faithfully confiding in our men and our cause, we cannot believe that the enemy is destined to gain any material advantages, near or remote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>If we foil him, however, now, he will soon have to encounter the <rs>Southern</rs> sun and the <rs>Southern</rs> malaria, which will be equal to a large army against him, while at home he must sustain the damaging consequences of a retarded advance and a postponed subjugation of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The elements of dissatisfaction and discord will be powerful in marring the schemes of the <rs>Washington</rs> despotism in proportion to the firmness and success with which we repulse its armies in the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> This is the conclusion to which we must always come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>After all, it is alone upon our own courage and fidelity that we can rely.--Discord at the home of the invader &mdash; aversion to him amongst civilized people abroad &mdash; can only be made active and efficient for his discomfiture by our own undying and unflagging devotion to our beloved country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Thank <name n="God" type="God">God</name>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>we have the men who can exhibit these virtues in their noblest form. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> The true feeling and inclination of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> in reference to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> may be gathered from their journals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>This is bitter and hostile in the extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The Federal Government, however, will take care to avoid an open rupture with <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>; for that they dread at this time almost as much as the <rs>British Cabinet</rs> itself does!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, however, continue to assail the <rs>English</rs> through their journals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>They reproach them for selfishness, craftiness, and treachery &mdash; vices which they desire that none but themselves shall employ with success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>They charge them with man&#x0153;nvring all the time for their own aggrandizement and the widening of their influence over the policy and commerce of the nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>They charge them especially with favoring the rebellion and fitting out piratical ships for the <rs>Confederates</rs>, to enable them to destroy the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>They award no credit whatever to the <rs>British Government</rs> for its policy of neutrality between the great belligerents in the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> war, but at tribute it entirely to interested motives &mdash; mainly to the fear of losing their <placeName reg="Canadian River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7019930">Canadian</placeName> possessions and the probable destruction, in case of war, of <name>British</name> commerce by Federal privateers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>In this last we think the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> tell the truth. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> We have before us the <orgName n="Baltimore American" type="newspaper">Baltimore <hi rend="italics">American</hi></orgName> of the <num value="8" type="ordinal">8th</num>, in which there is a tremendous broadside against <persName n="Bull,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="default:Bull,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Bull</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>It charges him with all manner of crimes, and reviewing his policy relative to <placeName key="tgn,1000144" n="1.000 41" reg="turkiye">Turkey</placeName>, suggests that there is yet under cover of his professions of neutrality some dreadful designs against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>It fears that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, carrying out its policy in reference to <placeName key="tgn,1000144" n="1.000 41" reg="turkiye">Turkey</placeName>, may come on the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> shore to take care of the effects of another &#x0022;sick man.&#x0022; It thus concludes its terrible attack: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> &#x0022;Let us on this side of the <rs>Atlantic</rs> take warning by present British &#x0027;audacity&#x0027; in regard to the sick man;&#x0022; let us take care that they do not find in us another &#x0027;sick man&#x0027; to administer upon quire as tempting to their wholesale cupidity as that they are gloating over at present in the case of the <rs>Ottoman Empire</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The entering wedge has already been tried in the case of our neighbor &mdash; <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>.
