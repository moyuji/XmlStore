<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/> I cannot conceal from myself the fact that so much of the report as refers to my command (except some general compliments to the courage of a portion of my troops on <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct>, <date value="12-31">the 31st December,</date>) is in tone and spirit a thorough disparagement of both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>This tone runs through all its parts and lies like a broad foundation underneath the whole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>At the same time the narrative of events is made to sustain the general spirit. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/> While the report of the commanding General fails, as I think, to do justice to the behavior of my division on <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>, <date value="01-02">the 2d of January,</date> yet its strictures are chiefly leveled at my own conduct as an officer during all the operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>By direct statement and by unmistakable innuendo, it is throughout a reflection upon my capacity and conduct. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> Without referring to its contents in detail, I have to say in respectful terms, that neither its material statements nor its equally material innuendoes can be maintained by proof &mdash; that its omission of important facts creditable to my division and myself is as remarkable as many of its affirmative statements &mdash; in a word, that in spirit and substance it is erroneous and unjust. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/> I trust that nothing in the foregoing expressions passes the limit of military propriety, and that plainness of statement will be pardoned to <num value="1">one</num> who, even under the weight of superior military censure, feels that both he and his command have deserved well of their country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/> Having met the commanding General repeatedly on the field, and on <num value="3">three</num> occasions in council during the progress of the operations, without receiving from him the least indication of dissatisfaction with my conduct, I was not prepared to see a report, bearing a subsequent date, containing representations at variance with these significant facts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>Nor was my surprise lessened when I observed that it was written after a correspondence with his corps and division commanders, (I being <num value="1">one</num> of the latter,) in which he invokes their aid to sustain him, and speaks of them as officers &#x0022;upon whom I (he) have ever relied as upon a foundation of rock.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/> The commanding General having written and forwarded his report before receiving those of his subordinate commanders could have derived no assistance in its preparations from those usual official aids to the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs>, and since his position on the field prevented him from seeing many of the movements, especially those of <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>, <date value="01-02">the 2d of January,</date> it much concerns all affected by his statements to know something of those other, and to them unknown, sources of information to which he has given the sanction of his influence and rank as the head of the army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/> I have felt that it would be improper in a paper of this character to enter upon a detailed vindication; yet in view of the fact that the casualties of war may at any time render an investigation impossible, I hope that it has not been improper for me to place on record this general protest against the injurious statements and inferences of the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-General">commanding General</rs>, particularly since, not anticipating his censures, I may not have been sufficiently minute in portions of my report. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/> And in regard to the action of <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>, <date value="01-02">the 2d of January,</date> upon which the commanding General heaps so much criticism, I have to say with the utmost confidence that the failure of my troops to hold the position which they carried on that occasion was due to no fault of theirs or of mine, but to the fact that we were commanded to do an impossible thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>My force was about <num value="4500">4,500</num> men, of these, <num value="1700">1,700</num> heroic spirits stretched upon that bloody field, in an unequal struggle against <num value="3">three</num> divisions, a brigade, an overwhelming concentration of artillery, attested our efforts to obey the order. </p>
