<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The real position of the <num value="2">two</num> armies was not known, though it was stated that the enemy, when last heard from, were rapidly retreating in the direction of <placeName reg="Occoquan River, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2555112">Occoquan</placeName>, and our forces hotly pursuing.

<head>The duty of Congress.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/> If Congress would <unclear></unclear> strike a blow whose moral weight will be as tremendous as the physical of the late battles, let it at once adopt the most prompt and vigorous measures for extending the conscription act, so as to embrace all able-bodied men in the <rs>Confederacy</rs> between the ages of <num value="18">eighteen</num> and <num value="45">forty-five</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>The <rs>North</rs> will calculate upon the <rs>South</rs> reposing once more upon the laurels of its <rs n="Second Battle of Manassas" type="battle">second Manassas</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>Let us now prove that we have learnt something from the bitter lessons of experience, and show our enemy that we are just beginning the war, so far as his participation in its calamities concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>Let us prepare not only to meet the new legions he is raising, but to push the tide of battle at once into his own country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>If the <rs>North</rs> sees that we are no longer intoxicated with the fames of victory, that it only makes us more energetic and determined for the future, it will begin to turn its thoughts to peace, and recall from the horrors which are impending over its own head. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/> Let Congress be prompt in reinforcing the army; let our commanders push promptly on into the enemy's country; let cavalry expeditions make raids into their territory, and seize and bring off their prominent citizens to be held as hostages for the security of those of our own people who now languish in Federal prisons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>Now, now is the time for Congress and for the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> to strike a decisive blow for our salvation. </p> </div3>

<head>Neutrality with a Vengeance.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/> We see it stated that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government has made a large contract for arms with certain <name>English</name> manufacturers, to be delivered within a certain time, provided, in the interval, war does not break out between the <num value="2">two</num> countries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>As there is no probability that the contingency provided against will happen, the bargain may be considered as closed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>The arms will be delivered to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and they will kill as many <q>&#x0022;rebels&#x0022;</q> with them as they can. As our coast is blockaded, and we have no navy, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have it all their own way. This may be neutrality, for aught we know to the contrary, but to us it seems a very strange kind of neutrality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>The next thing to killing a man <num value="1">one</num>'s self we take to be giving <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> person a weapon to kill him with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>When a murder takes place under such circumstances, in ordinary life, the principal is <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> hung and then the party giving the weapon is indicted as an accessory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>The old <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> at <num value="1">one</num> time made heavy complaints against the <rs>British Government</rs> because <name>British</name> subjects were in the habit of selling firearms to the <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indians</rs> upon the borders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>It was for that offence, as well as we recollect, and for the further crime of instigating them to make war upon the while inhabitants, that <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00234" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> hung <persName n="Arbuthnot,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00235" reg="mostcommon:Arbuthnot,nomatch:0"><surname>Arbuthnot</surname></persName> and Administer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>We can see but little difference between the <measure n="2cases" type="mass">two cases</measure>, except that we are already engaged in war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/> This so-called neutrality of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> is quite as oppressive to us as would be a formal war. It has the effect of depriving us entirely of those munitions of war which she furnishes in profusion to our enemy, who are already enormously superior to us in that particular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>If the <rs>British Government</rs> were disposed to observe a <hi rend="italics">real</hi> neutrality, it would take steps to prevent the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> from being furnished with what we cannot obtain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>It would forbid the exportation of arms by either party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>It would allow nothing which would give to <num value="1">one</num> advantages which the other did not possess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>When it promised neutrality, it would take care that neither party should profit by it to the detriment of another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>A neutrality which destroys <num value="1">one</num> belligerent while it is of infinite benefit to the other, is very much like war upon the injured party. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
