<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>The recollections and associations which press upon me render it impossible for me to do little more than acknowledge their kindness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>My political career is ended, and I am warned that in the course of nature my life approaches its termination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>I come back to the scene of my early labors and cares and exertions, endeared to me by many an interesting association to remain among you till, in the providence of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, I shall be called to meet that final change that sooner or later must come to all. A young adventurer in this great region of the <rs>Northwest</rs>, it has proved to me, as to many others, not only a land of promise, but a land also of performance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>You have been pleased to refer in terms of commendation to the services I have been called upon to render to this section of our common country.

I can scarcely persuade myself that I am not oppressed by some fearful dream, when I reflect upon all that is passing in our country, and upon the position in which this great Republic is placed, suddenly struck from the summit of its prosperity, and with a future before us which no man can contemplate without the most serious alarm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>In all history there is nothing like it. With no external enemy to trouble us, with no internal oppression, with none of those visitations of pestilence or famine or other evils by which nations are often punished for their offences, we have recklessly put to hazard our inestimable blessings, and are entering that path of discord, and division, and border disputes, which, if there is any truth in history, must lead to most disastrous consequences.
