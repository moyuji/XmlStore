<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/> The facts with regard to the battle near <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> are becoming better known, and as they gradually develop themselves, the gloom which at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> settled down upon our people dispersion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>It is evident that <persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00160" reg="mostcommon:Early,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName> made a desperate resistance &mdash; that for several hours he had the best of the battle &mdash; that the enemy lost enormously &mdash; that our troops were finally compelled to leave the field by a flank movement, executed by a very superior body of cavalry,--and that the movement in retreat was executed in the most exact order and without the slightest confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>The statement of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> general, that he killed or <measure n="5000" type="wounded">wounded five thousand</measure> men, and captured half that number, is evidently a falsehood; for had the loss been so great in an army no larger than that under the command of <persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00161" reg="mostcommon:Early,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName>, at least half the train of artillery would have been captured; whereas, we lost but <num value="3">three</num> pieces.--The man who makes this statement, it is to be recollected, is <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00162" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,nomatch:0"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> &mdash; the same man who claimed a victory at <persName n="Trevillian,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00163" reg="mostcommon:Trevillian,nomatch:0"><surname>Trevillian</surname></persName>'s depot, after having been more shamefully routed than any general of the war who stated that his whole loss on that occasion was less than <num value="200">two hundred</num>, killed, wounded and prisoners, whereas, <num value="487">four hundred and eighty-seven</num>, taken in that fight, were actually at that time prisoners in this city; and who telegraphed to <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00164" reg="nearbymention:Stanton,Edwin,M.,,"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName> that the object of his expedition had been completely accomplished; whereas, that object was to destroy the tunnel and unite with Haunter, and he was routed and turned back before he had gone half way. It is stated by others that <persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00165" reg="mostcommon:Early,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName> lost, in all, about <num value="2500">two thousand five hundred</num> men, of whom about <num value="500">five hundred</num> were reported missing, and even this we believe to be an exaggeration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> appear to have paid dearly for this success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>Their loss, according to <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00166" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,nomatch:0"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName>, is <num value="2000">two thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>We suppose it is at least that, and some <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="6000">six thousand</num> more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>Our men were in position, and were attacked by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>It is reasonable to infer, therefore, that they killed and wounded a vast many more than they lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/><num value="6">Six</num> or <num value="8000">eight thousand</num> is a very small estimate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>We speak sincerely when we say that we have no fears for <persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00167" reg="mostcommon:Early,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName>.--The fact that the enemy did not attempt to pursue him after the day of the battle is significant of another fact, and that is, that he was awfully crippled, and did not feel in a condition to improve his victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>He must get reinforcements before he can push <persName n="Early,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00168" reg="mostcommon:Early,nomatch:0"><surname>Early</surname></persName>, and in the meantime <rs>Early</rs> is in a position and a country in which cavalry can do very little service, save as scouts and patrols.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>We hardly think <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00169" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,nomatch:0"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName> will be able to play his destined <hi rend="italics">role</hi> of capturing <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName> and the canal, and the <rs>Southside</rs> and <rs>Danville</rs> railroads, this winter at least.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>He has but <measure n="6weeks" type="date">six weeks</measure> more to do it in, and his movements are hardly rapid enough to accomplish it by that time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/> In this campaign, notwithstanding the <num value="2">two</num> small reverses at <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> and <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>, the balance has been greatly in our favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>We have frustrated the most tremendous combination ever formed against any modern city, and in frustrating it, have slain or wounded, or otherwise put <hi rend="italics">hors de combat,</hi> at least <num value="200000">two hundred thousand</num> men, of which number <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00170" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> himself lost, under his own immediate eye, at least <num value="150000">one hundred and fifty thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>That general himself acknowledges that he has been awfully beaten when he calls for <num value="100000">one hundred thousand</num> fresh troops to finish the job which he expected to finish last <dateStruct value="-06-"><month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>He is conscious that he does so, and endeavors to explain it away in conversation with <num value="1">one</num> of the <unclear> </unclear> that stuck to him like a leech in his late journey from <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> to <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>He only wants them, he says, to make the victory more complete, and to diminish the effusion of blood.--Those are the very objects for which all commanders seek overwhelming numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>To state that object is merely to confess that his present numbers are insufficient to effect the object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>Now, taking in <orgName n="army"><persName n="Hunter,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00171" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><surname>Hunter</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> and <orgName n="army"><persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00172" reg="nearbymention:Butler,James,T.,,"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>, <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00173" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> had at least <num value="300000">three hundred thousand</num> men engaged in this enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>If he still wants <num value="100000">one hundred thousand</num> more, it affords the strongest proof that he has been signally and terribly beaten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>We say, then, that thus far the advantage in this campaign has been prodigiously on our side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>We have killed enormous numbers of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and that is the surest way to bring the rest to their senses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>It is far better, indeed, than peace congresses at <placeName reg="Niagara, New York, United States" key="tgn,1002718">Niagara</placeName> or elsewhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are the most mercenary of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> creatures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>If the ministry of our Saviour had been among <hi rend="italics">them</hi> instead of the <rs n="Jewish" type="religion">Jews</rs>, instead of lasting <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> it would not have lasted <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>. Some <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <persName n="Judas,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00174" reg="mostcommon:Judas,nomatch:0"><surname>Judas</surname></persName> would have sold him in less than half that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>And yet the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> loves his life better even than his interest; and when the universal nation finds that nothing but death is to be gotten by coming here, they will conclude that it does not pay, and will give it up. The best road to peace lies through the blood of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>The more we kill, the nearer we approach to peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>Such being the fact, we must be admitted to have made vast progress in this campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>They have been slaughtered awfully here and everywhere else. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
