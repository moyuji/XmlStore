<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>When Northern citizens begin to contemplate in earnest the debt which the <rs>Washington Government</rs> is now running up for them, and begin to realize the hopelessness of ever restoring the <rs>Union</rs> and obtaining the aid of the <rs>South</rs> in discharging it, they cannot fail to be filled with dismay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The expenditures of their Government at this time, on ordinary account, are <measure n="80000000dollars" type="currency">$80,000,000</measure> a year, by report of their <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Their war expenditures are known to be at least at the rate of <measure n="300000000dollars" type="currency">$300,000,000</measure> a year, which is raised on <num value="0.08">eight per cent.</num> bonds, sold at <measure n="80cents" type="currency">eighty cents</measure> in the dollar &mdash; that is to say, at the rate of <num value="0.1">ten per cent.</num> interest, besides the loss of the <num value="0.2">twenty per cent</num> margin on the bonds, equal to <num value="0.01">one per cent.</num> a year on <num value="20">twenty</num>-year bonds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>At this rate of <num value="0.11">eleven per cent</num> per anunm, their war debt will cost the <rs>North</rs> <measure n="33000000dollars" type="currency">$33,000,000</measure> a year for interest and discount, besides the par redemption of the principal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The ordinary expenditure being <measure n="80000000dollars" type="currency">$80,000,000</measure> per annum, the people of the <rs>North</rs> are saddled with an annual charge of <measure n="113000000dollars" type="currency">$113,000,000</measure>, which must be paid by taxation in some form; and this annual charge will be increased by the sum of <num value="33">thirty-three</num> additional <num value="1000000">millions</num> for each additional year that the war is protracted. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> At present they cannot eke out more than <measure n="50000000dollars" type="currency">$50,000,000</measure> a year from their tariff and from direct taxation; and there is thus a deficit of <num value="63000000">sixty-three millions</num> already in their annual accounts, which will be increased to <num value="96000000">ninety-six millions</num>, <num value="159000000">one hundred and fifty-nine millions</num>, and so on, should the war be continued <num value="1">one</num>, <num value="2">two</num> or more years longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>During the continuance of the war, this annual deficit will probably be supplied by sale of bonds; but when peace recurs, it will have to be met by stern taxation; and the predicament of the people having to pay it will be in the last degree unenviable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The South will find out that they have escaped the most enormous taxation which a free people have ever yet had to endure; and that their secession, in a mere financial point of view, was the happiest deliverance ever vouchsafed to people since <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><foreName>Israel</foreName></persName></hi> crossed the <placeName reg="Red Sea" key="tgn,7016791">Red Sea</placeName> and <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Miriam,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Miriam,nomatch:0"><surname>Miriam</surname></persName></hi> sang her song of triumph. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Their export of breadstuffs and provisions is very small, and they will have no employment for that vast shipping that has heretofore been engaged in carrying the immense trade which grew out of and depended upon our Southern staples.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The channels of princely revenue which formerly poured the wealth of the <rs>South</rs> into their lap, will be dried up; and whereas, before, they would have been able to pay the most enormous taxes without feeling them as a burden, they will now be unable to pay even small taxes without difficulty and suffering, much less the prodigious taxes which will fall upon and crush them utterly. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The rattling sabres and loaded muskets of our own soldiers meet it wherever it turns; the fierce steel of Federal bayonets is gleaming in the grey distance; and the flags of both nations fling deflantly their <hi rend="italics">Stare and Bars</hi> and <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Stars and Stripes" type="newspaper">Stars and Stripes</orgName></hi> upon the breeze.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>The banner of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> is waving in plain view from an eminence near <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName> and gazing upon this <hi rend="italics">badge of tyranny,</hi> and remembering the foul disgrace into which it has fallen, we feel like pointing our eager soldiers to the spot where it floats and invoking them to tear down the mocking emblem and trample it 'neath their feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Nothing, however, remains of it but the outward form; each Star and Stripe blazes as of yore, but the spirit has forever fied, and where victory was once proud to perch, now sit engraven infamy and defeat. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/> A dark shade seems resting upon this portion of the <rs>State</rs>, and truly has the abolition fiend compelled his unhappy victims to drain the cup of ruin to its dregs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>The country immediately around here was owned almost exclusively by Northern men who emigrated to it a number of years ago, bought cheaply our lands, were soon admitted to the high name and privileges of true natives; but, adder-like, after being warmed into life and wealth, sought to inflict upon their country a mortal blow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>A large majority of these settlers voted openly for <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, and confident of our quick subjugation and enslavement, have been giving to the enemy all the aid and comfort in their power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>They assisted liberally the grand army in its advance, protected and sheltered the flying fugitives in their flight; and now, that the whole country has been abandoned to our arms, have been obliged to fly from their homes and property into the barren inhospitable regions of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Confiscation will of course fall upon their estates, and indeed their <rs n="household furniture" type="product">household furniture</rs>, their gardens, the unripe corn in their fields, and all the portable effects they owned, have been appropriated by our soldiers, whose plan of confiscation in such cases embraces no dull routine of legal forms, but like <persName n="Greeley,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Greeley,nomatch:0"><surname>Greeley</surname></persName>'s war, is <q> &#x0022;short, sharp and decisive.&#x0022;</q> A mile below <placeName reg="Mason's Hill">Mason's Hill</placeName>, on the road to <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>, resided <num value="2">two</num> of these creatures named Barcrofts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>The elder <num value="1">one</num>--the father &mdash; had accumulated considerable wealth, and upon his well cultivated farm had just reared a handsome dwelling, highly convenient in its construction, and supplied with all the comforts and luxuries of a country residence.--The younger <num value="1">one</num> was a practitioner of medicine, and resided near his father.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Their smothered abolitionism burst forth upon the suceess of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>; and when the mighty uprising of the <rs>North</rs>, that followed the bombardment of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> occurred, proclaimed themselves in favor of subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>It is exactly opposite the fort on <placeName reg="Shooters Hill, Goochland, Virginia" key="tgn,7022127">Shooter's Hill</placeName>, and is, I think, within range of the heavy guns, although no serious damage could be done with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/>With the most bitter grief will you both look back on your course of imbecility, madness and folly.

There will be awful suffering in your Northern States soon, which will bring on a terrible re-action.
