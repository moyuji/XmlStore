<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>Having altered that resolution, we shall dismiss it in as few words as possible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/> It is certain that nobody assisted <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00208" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> in the concoction and execution of this famous performance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/><persName n="Byron,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00209" reg="mostcommon:Byron,nomatch:0"><surname>Byron</surname></persName> and <persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00210" reg="mostcommon:Scott,nomatch:0"><surname>Scott</surname></persName> were not more surely the authors of <persName n="Harold,,Chlide,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00211" reg="default:Harold,Chlide,,,"><foreName>Chlide</foreName> <surname>Harold</surname></persName> and Waverley than <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00212" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> is author of this message.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>There are earmarks in every sentence which it is impossible to mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>Other men are as feeble, and others again as vulgar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>But no other man ever blended folly and vulgarity in such exquisite union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>To lie, we have often said, is natural to a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>But <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00213" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> does not even lie with judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>The object of a lie is to deceive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/><persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00214" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> deceives nobody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>For instance, when he says that the war expenses for the fiscal year have been but <measure n="474000000dollars" type="currency">$474,000,000</measure>, every man who ever heard of the force he has set on foot sees at once that he is lying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>In the old army the total military expenses were found, when added up, to average <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">$1,000</measure> per man per annum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>The pay of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00215" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s soldiers is much greater than the pay of the old army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>But allowing it to be the same, he has had on his muster rolls, and drawing pay, for more than a year, <num value="750000">750,000</num> men, which gives <measure n="750000000dollars" type="currency">$750,000,000</measure>. Besides, he has <num value="380">380</num> ships of war in commission, which must cost a prodigious sum. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/> Again, we are told that the <q>&#x0022;public credit has been fully maintained.&#x0022;</q> The bankers of New York and <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, who have been paying premiums of <num value="30">30</num>, <num value="33">33</num>, and <num value="0.35">35 per cent</num> for gold, for the last <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>, will believe this, of course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>They will believe it only the more strongly when they see the <name>Banks</name> called on to fork over their notes, and take in exchange U. S. bonds, which they are then to deposit and receive Treasury notes at <num value="0.06">six per cent</num> interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>Of course we suppose the <name>Banks</name> cannot find customers at home to take their notes at <num value="0.06">six per cent</num>; otherwise they would not be very eager to lend them to the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>This is certainly a very pretty scheme to raise the wind, and indicates a very satisfactory condition of the public credit. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/> In the third place, it is more than insinuated that the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities excited the <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> massacres in <placeName reg="Minnesota" key="tgn,7007521">Minnesota</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>This lie is too stupid even for <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00216" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>It must have been suggested by somebody a shade more stupid than himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>The <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">State of Missouri</placeName>, the nearest <rs>Confederate State</rs> to <placeName reg="Minnesota" key="tgn,7007521">Minnesota</placeName>, is separated from it by at least <measure n="500miles" type="distance">five hundred miles</measure>. If, however, the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities had done so, they would only have imitated <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00217" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> himself, who is trying to kindle a servile war in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>His bad conscience leads him astray.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>The Confederate authorities are gentlemen and humane man. They are incapable of imitating his atrocities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>Because he is a brute, he has no right to conclude that everybody else is so. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/> Fourthly and lastly, <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00218" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> tells us that the relations of his Government with foreign powers are satisfactory &mdash; not so happy as they might be, but still pretty fair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>He says nothing of the proposal submitted by the <rs>French Emperor</rs>, which indicates that the relations in question are anything else than satisfactory; but he lets it leak out that in <dateStruct value="-06-"><month reg="06">June</month></dateStruct> last, before <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00219" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> was driven, like a hunted wolf from den to den on the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, there was a prospect of inducing the nations of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> to recall the recognition of the <rs>Confederates</rs> as belligerents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>That notable exploit of the <q>&#x0022;young <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00220" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>,&#x0022;</q> however, put a new face upon affairs, and the recognition was not recalled. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/> A large part of the message is devoted to the compensation emancipation scheme, as set forth in his inaugural.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>This is to finish the war at once, and, as he seems to think, without bloodshed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>The negroes, he has found out, instead of being in our way, are a great assistance to the rebellion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>They stay at home and work the crops, while their masters go abroad and fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>Emancipate them, and pay the good Union men who own them, and the war will be over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>We wonder if he is really a downright fool.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>The negroes are to be colonized, if he can get anywhere to colonize them; or they are to go North, if the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> will let them; or they are to stay at home and live on a footing of equality with their former masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>This is the way the rebellion is to be stopped, and for this consummation <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00221" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> has shed a perfect sea of blood. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/> Nothing in the whole message is more ridiculous than the estimate of the probable population of what was once the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in <dateStruct value="1920--"><year reg="1920">1920</year></dateStruct>--an estimate borrowed from some of the old <q>&#x0022;manifest destiny&#x0022;</q> articles of the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>The country cannot be separated, he thinks, because the <rs type="place">Mississippi runs</rs> entirely through it, and because there are no natural boundaries between the separate portions!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>We wonder if he ever heard of the <rs>Rhine</rs> and the <rs>Danube</rs>, of the nations that live on the opposite shores, and of the independent States of <placeName reg="Germany" key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName> and <placeName reg="Italia" key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName>, of <placeName reg="Espana" key="tgn,1000095">Spain</placeName> and <placeName reg="Portugal" key="tgn,1000090">Portugal</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/> This message, the last and poorest of all <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00222" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s papers, is but a compound of vulgarity and folly. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>The very moderate measure of humanity proposed by the <rs>Emperor</rs> of the <rs>French</rs>, backed by <num value="3">three</num> such Powers as <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Rossiya" key="tgn,7002435">Russia</placeName>, could have given no offence to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, which has already shown that it cannot afford to be offended by any <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> Power, even when there is real cause of offence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>What is there in the proposition of an armistice to wound the sensibilities of any <num value="1">one</num>? --The truth is, <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> desires the war to be waged to its bitter end, hoping to build up her own interests upon the ruin of both parties. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>The course of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> will only alienate the <rs>South</rs>, without propitiating the <rs>North</rs>.--The people of that country will never forgive <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> the just mortification to which she subjected them in the <rs>Trent</rs> affair, and the aid and comfort her journals have given the <rs>Southern</rs> cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>In whatever way the war terminates <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> will be equally the loser.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>If the <rs>South</rs> should be conquered bock to the <rs>Union</rs>, <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a century would see the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> more powerful than ever, and as able as she would be eager to wipe out every vestige of <name>British</name> dominion from this Continent.
