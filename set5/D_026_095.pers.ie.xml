<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> Yesterday opened with a shower of rumors of important Confederate successes in various quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>It was said by those who professed to have it from unquestionable authority that several towns in different quarters had succumbed to our forces, and that, as a consequence, large quantities of stores and many prisoners had fallen into our hands. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> It was also stated that a portion of our forces had engaged the enemy on the <rs>Rapidan</rs>, but this, like the rumors mentioned above, proved to be without foundation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The press and the pulpit denounced in the most furious language every man who should assist his own country in the hour of danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/><placeName key="tgn,7013445" n="1.000 1" reg="boston, suffolk, massachusetts">In Boston</placeName> associations were entered into for the purpose of preventing the filling up of Government loris.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>A Convention was held for the express purpose of thwarting the measures of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>This was done by the very party which, when its own friends were in power, enacted alien and sedition laws, and suffered not the winds of heaven to visit the <rs>Federal</rs> authority too roughly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> The Washington Administration of that day treated with the utmost forbearance these <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> secessionists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>They neither demanded any extraordinary powers from Congress, nor enforced, to their full extent, those with which they were invested by the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Public opinion was left alone to combat the treason which, in the midst of its country's perils, could raise its looked tongue against her heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> But no sooner did <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> again attain ascendancy in the national councils than the spirit of the alien and sedition laws revived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>They could propose Dissolution with impunity in the midst of a foreign war, but Southern Secession, in the midst of peace, and when rendered necessary for the preservation of its domestic institutions, must be visited with fire and sword, confiscation and extermination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>It is of a piece with their whole character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>It must not be forgotten that the adventurous spirit of <name>English</name> merchants led the way at the outset in blockade running, and it is much to be regretted that the <rs>Confederates</rs> themselves did not take the initiative in the matter, and that even at this date their enterprise (their patriotism is beyond question) has not been more concentrated on so vital an issue as the conveyance of munitions of war and necessary merchandize to the <rs>Confederacy</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/> We have investigated the merits of the new law with an anxious desire to trace in it marked and decided advantages to Confederate interests, as distinct from all other interests, but we are not of those who consider the cause of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> will be best served by tacitly assenting to all the measures which may emanate from the <rs>Executive</rs>, and we consider it to be self evident, that in examining such a measure as the <num value="1">one</num> we are discussing, it is impossible to ignore the interests of the blockade runner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>The Confederates have made great and noble sacrifices, but they cannot sure mount the impossibilities, and an impossibility it certainly would prove to be to carry on blockade running on a comprehensive scale without a large margin of profit being allowed to meet inevitable contingencies. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/> On the other hand, another communication from &#x0022;Justice,&#x0022; in the same paper, writes the following sensible views on the subject: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/> Has the present system of blockade running been beneficial to the <rs>Confederates</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>This must be answered by its results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>What have they been?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>A depreciation of their currency &mdash; an exorbitant rate of prices, and the establishment of a wide spread and unprincipled extortion. </p> </q><bibl n="another communication from &#x0022;Justice,&#x0022;"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/> The blockade runner has ever refused to take Confederate money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>He has ever demanded gold or cotton, and the country has been drained of specie.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>This, as a matter of course, increased the price of exchange, and it has been steadily increasing ever since this system of importing began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Gold has flowed from and not into the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, because the blockade runner has not taken gold with which to buy his cotton; he has always entered a Confederate port with a small supply of goods, such as were scarce in the market at the time, fixed his own prices and demanded gold or cotton in return. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/> This may be considered as warranted by the risk he runs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>But why does he not take gold with which to buy his cotton?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Simply because he can demand a greater quantity of cotton in return for his goods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>The purchaser, as a matter of course, is compelled to increase his prices before he can retail the goods he buys, and hence has arisen a system of unprincipled and uncalled for extortion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/> Such has been the actual results of blockade running.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>But we are told &#x0022;it has done the <rs>Confederates</rs> an immense amount of good; had it not been for it the <rs>Confederacy</rs> would have &#x0027;goes up&#x0027; long since.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/> To save our lives we can't see it in this light What has been the character of goods imported &mdash; silks, satins, laces, broadcloth, liquors, and ladies&#x0027; goods generally &mdash; while they have carried but a very small proportion of army supplies, and these, fortunately, were stowed in that part of the vessel which the <rs>Government</rs> had wisely reserved to itself or they would never have gotten there, or otherwise the <rs>Government</rs> would have been the victim of an outrageous and unparalleled extortion, which would have soon made it bankrupt sure enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>And we may safely add, had not the <rs>Government</rs> reserved to itself this right it would have &#x0022;gone up&#x0022; indeed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/> Now, suppose the present companies stop, what then?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>It must be remembered that the <rs>Confederates</rs> are fighting for life and liberty, and not for the purpose of enabling <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> parties to amass colossal fortunes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>And there are patriotic and enterprising men in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, who will willingly give not only <num value="0.5">one-half</num>, but the whole of their vessels&#x0027; capacity to the <rs>Government</rs>, should the country demand it; and those stopping will soon find to their sorrow that &#x0022;Othello's occupation's gone,&#x0022; and their places filled by men who are equally, if not better, suited to the purpose. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/> But the <rs>Confederates</rs> do not mean to run the present companies off. They offer to pay them large freight, more than the average price of cotton in times of peace &mdash; sixpence sterling per pound.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>Supposes a vessel brings over <measure n="200barrels" type="mass">200 bales</measure> of cotton, weighing <measure n="400l." type="pounds"><num value="400">400</num> pounds</measure> each, the freight alone will amount to &#x00A3;<num value="2000000">2,000,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Is it, then, their policy to quit? </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/> Some of our citizens are disposed to turn their attention to the culture of silk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>It would afford a new and most profitable employment to women and children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>Many years ago there was a great deal of silk produced in this State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>The morus multicaulis was extensively cultivated, and almost every house had its room devoted to silk worms, and their feeding and spinning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>The business was abandoned, however, and the multicaulis trees were taken up by the roots, and cast out upon the highways to die. Yet there are no doubt some scattering bushes which escaped the general massacre which occurred when it was concluded that the enterprise was unprofitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>Moreover, it may be that some person having faith in the old adage that everything &mdash; the most useless, even &mdash; comes in use once in <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure>, may have saved and kept on hand a small stock of the silk worms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>There is now an enquiry for them, and if anybody has ever so small a family, their eggs will sell almost as high as hen's eggs.
