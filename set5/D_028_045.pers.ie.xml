<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> It is our solemn duty, at all times, and more especially in a season of public trial and adversity, to acknowledge our dependence on His mercy, and to how in humble submission before His footstool, confessing our manifold sins, supplicating His gracious pardon, imploring His Divine help, and devotedly rendering thanks for the many and great blessings which He has vouchsafed to us. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>It is natural that such conduct should excite indignation among the most scrupulous and honest community in the world, but we doubt whether it can be proved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>We are unwilling to believe that our late estimable neighbor at <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> gap is capable not only of such an abomination, but of the infinitely greater wickedness of being found out.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The pulpit has fulminated its thunders every Sunday of the year, and the press every day of the week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>But the most eloquent sermon on extortion might as well be preached to the waves of the sea, and the most scathing pens are as powerless to arrest the course of speculators as the pinions from which they were plucked to change the course of the winds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>We have heard of reformed gamblers, reformed drunkards, and reformed transgressors of various kinds, but a reformed speculator is a prodigy that has not been brought to light in this or any other day and generation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>There is a good deal more than that missing from many Confederate soldiers and citizens, but no need of advertising.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>It can readily be found on the fat speculators, who have gained as much as their countrymen have lost; who have absorbed all the rich juices of the land; lean and hungry kine before the war, who have since devoured all the fat and well liking; thin and blasted ears that have swallowed a thriving harvest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>And they think they have done well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Perhaps they have.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>But if a good name be of any account; if it matters aught to a man's descendants what was the character and conduct of their forefather in such a struggle as this, then the men who have grown rich while their country grew poor &mdash; who have swollen their carcases by sucking out the life-blood of their native land &mdash; have not done well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>All other objects in nature have their uses; the trees of the field, and even the winter ice &mdash; not as cold as an extortioner's nature; but we can conceive no use for speculators, except to fatten the worms with their gross flesh, and to use their hearts as bomb-proof coverings for magazines, or sheathing for vessels, capable of resisting <measure n="11inch" type="distance">eleven-inch</measure> shell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>They would not only take the oath of allegiance to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>--for it would be a mere matter of ceremony; they who do the enemy's work could have no objection to bearing his name &mdash; but to the <rs>Father</rs> of Evil himself, if he felt disposed to insist upon a mere form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>A great deal of sympathy has been expressed for some Confederate communities which have fallen within the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Some of them deserve that sympathy, but there are others in which the speculators and extortioners compose so large an element that the true objects of compassion are the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>We greatly underrate the supply of native-born talent when we suppose that all the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> shark has to do is to open his jaws and engulf simple-minded Confederates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>The case and plenty which once distinguished the <rs>South</rs> may have retarded the development of this kind of talent, but it needs only the spur of such times as these to prove that the land is capable of great things in every department of human enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>At that hour, the <num value="3">three</num>-story brick building on <address><street n="Main street">Main street</street></address>, between <address><street n="13 Street">Thirteenth</street></address> and <address><street n="14 Street">Fourteenth</street></address>, occupied jointly as a store and dwelling by <persName n="Marcuse,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00321" reg="mostcommon:Marcuse,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Marcuse</surname></persName> &#x0026; <persName n="Hutzler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00322" reg="mostcommon:Hutzler,nomatch:0"><surname>Hutzler</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Stebbins,Mister,Joseph,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00323" reg="default:Stebbins,Joseph,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Joseph</foreName> <surname>Stebbins</surname></persName> and family, was discovered to be on fire; and so rapidly did the flames spread, that the occupants of the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> story, consisting of <persName n="Stebbins,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00324" reg="nearbymention:Stebbins,Joseph,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stebbins</surname></persName>, his wife, and <num value="3">three</num> children, perished in the building. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>In an incredibly short time the flames enveloped the outside wooden structure, and running along, soon lapped up the stairway, which forms the only communication from the building to the yard below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>Fortunately the occupants of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> and <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> stories succeeded in escaping in their night clothes ere this avenue of egress was cut off, or else they, too, would have fallen victims to the devouring element. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/> As nothing was positively known of the fate of <persName n="Stebbins,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00329" reg="nearbymention:Stebbins,Joseph,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stebbins</surname></persName> and his family, strong hopes were entertained during the earlier part of the day (yesterday) that they had, in the excitement and confusion consequent upon the earlier stages of the conflagration, passed out of the alley leading to the street unobserved, and were quartered at the house of his brother, <persName n="Stebbins,Mister,Charles,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00330" reg="default:Stebbins,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Stebbins</surname></persName>, in the upper part of the city, or had taken refuge with some other of their friends and acquaintances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>Parties were sent in different directions to search for them, the crowd behind, in the meantime, peering and peeping about among the smouldering ruins in order to settle the doubt which still existed in the minds of some that human life had been sacrificed. --About <time value="11:30oclock">half past 11 o'clock</time>, the last messenger returned, bringing no tidings, when it was determined to ascend the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> story, which had not yet been explored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>Accordingly, the <orgName n="Hook and Ladder Company" type="company">Hook and Ladder Company</orgName> brought down <num value="1">one</num> of their ladders, which was placed on the outside of the building from <address><street n="Main street">Main street</street></address>, by which means access could be had to the highest point; and <num value="1">one</num> of the members was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sent up to ascertain the situation of affairs.--Near the street window were the bodies of <persName n="Stebbins,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00331" reg="nearbymention:Stebbins,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName><surname n="Stebbins"></surname></persName> and <persName n="Stebbins,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00332" reg="nearbymention:Stebbins,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Stebbins</surname></persName>, where they had fallen with their faces downwards, as if in the act of rushing back to the assistance of their children, while, in the other part of the room, the charred and almost limbless trunks of the <num value="3">three</num> children, consisting of their daughter, <persName><foreName>Laura</foreName></persName>, a beautiful young girl, <measure n="19years" type="date">nineteen years</measure> of age, and <num value="2">two</num> little sons, named <placeName key="tgn,6002055" n="1.000 83" reg="fort henry, stewart, tennessee">Henry</placeName>, aged <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure>, and <persName n="Arthur,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00333" reg="mostcommon:Arthur,nomatch:0"><surname>Arthur</surname></persName>, aged <num value="8">eight</num>, were lying with their faces leading to the street, as if endeavoring to follow their parents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>The <num value="3">three</num> children were lying together, the <num value="2">two</num> youngest being in the embrace of their sister, as if she were trying to carry them to a place of safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>The bodies of neither of them could be recognized by their features; and the only means by which they could be identified was their respective sizes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>About <time value="11oclock">11 o'clock</time> the unfortunate victims of this horrible occurrence were put into separate coffins, lowered to the ground from the front windows, and all placed together in an ambulance in waiting outside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>They were then taken to the <rs type="place">Broad Street</rs> <orgName n="Methodist Church" type="church">Methodist Church</orgName>, where an inquest was held by <persName n="Little,Coroner,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00334" reg="mostcommon:Little,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Coroner">Coroner</roleName> <surname>Little</surname></persName>, before whom the following testimony was elicited: </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>I did not see any of <persName n="Stebbins,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00336" reg="nearbymention:Stebbins,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stebbins</surname></persName>'s family, but distinctly heard, before I got to the house, <persName n="Stebbins,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00337" reg="nearbymention:Stebbins,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stebbins</surname></persName> crying for help; also, a female voice crying for help.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>When I arrived there, there were only a few persons present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/>I made an effort to pass through the store to the staircase be hind, which I found enveloped in flames.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>I passed through the store and through the back door to the platform outside.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>The doors were all open.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>I asked a lady if <persName n="Stebbins,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00338" reg="nearbymention:Stebbins,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stebbins</surname></persName>'s family had escaped; she told me she thought they had. I had no reason to believe that the place had been set on fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>I got a ladder and ascended to the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> story, which I found full of smoke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>I descended to the ground for the purpose of getting a longer ladder to reach to the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> story, but could not find <num value="1">one</num> long enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>I expressed my fears to a fireman that there were some persons in the building, when he responded, it was none of my business, and ordered me off. I think if I could have gotten a ladder sufficient- </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/> ly long to reach the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> story I could have saved the bodies, if not the lives, of <persName n="Stebbins,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00339" reg="nearbymention:Stebbins,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stebbins</surname></persName> and his family. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/> <persName n="Christian,,R.,J.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00340" reg="default:Christian,R.,J.,,"><foreName>R.</foreName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <surname>Christian</surname></persName>, having been sworn, testified &mdash; Last night, about <time value="1oclock">1 o'clock</time>, I was on <address><street n="Main street">Main street</street></address>, and hearing the cry of fire, proceeded in the direction from whence it proceeded; found the house next door to <persName n="Johnston,,P.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00341" reg="default:Johnston,P.,,,"><foreName>P.</foreName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> on fire in the rear; went up a small pair of steps, which led to the sleeping apartments of the occupants of the store; assisted in removing the children and some bedding from the room to across the street; when I returned, heard that there were persons sleeping up stairs; went to the steps, but found the fire had gained such headway that I could not get up; I then went to the front of the house, on <address><street n="Main street">Main street</street></address>, and heard the cries of persons in distress up stairs; called for a rope to throw up, but could not get <num value="1">one</num>; some beds were put on the pavement, and the parties in the house were told to jump out; they did not do so, I suppose, on account of the distance; or, I think, they must have been nearly suffocated, as the smoke was issuing in large volumes from the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>-story windows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>Heard the shrieks of the persons above; <num value="1">one</num> said, &#x0022;It is too late.&#x0022; Just about this time the <orgName n="Hook and Ladder Company" type="company">Hook and Ladder Company</orgName> arrived on the spot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>I assisted in putting up the ladders; found them too short to reach up high enough, and looked on the end to see if they could not be put together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>After seeing <persName n="Hayward,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00342" reg="nearbymention:Hayward,William,H.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Hayward</surname></persName> descending, asked him if he could do anything?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>He said no. At this time the firemen increased in number, and cleared the sidewalks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>Know nothing of the origin of the fire; but think that, if the ladders had been long enough, some assistance might have been rendered the occupants, although the fire was well under way before the firemen arrived. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/> At the conclusion of the evidence, the jury rendered as their verdict that the said <rs>Joseph</rs>, <persName><foreName>Mary</foreName></persName> E., <persName><foreName>Laura</foreName></persName>, <placeName key="tgn,6002055" n="1.000 83" reg="fort henry, stewart, tennessee">Henry</placeName> and <persName n="Stebbins,,Arthur,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00343" reg="default:Stebbins,Arthur,,,"><foreName>Arthur</foreName> <surname>Stebbins</surname></persName>, came to their deaths by the accidental burning of the house in which they lived. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/> From the position in which the bodies were lying when found, it is supposed that the room in which they were sleeping was filled with smoke and fire before they awoke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/>That, being aroused, they sprang for the stairway, but, finding it on fire, made their way into the front room, on opening the door to which a draft was created, which drew the flames after them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/>As it was stated by <num value="1">one</num> of the witnesses before the <rs>Coroner</rs> that he called to <persName n="Stebbins,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00344" reg="nearbymention:Stebbins,Arthur,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Stebbins</surname></persName> and his wife to jump out of the window, but they failed to do so, and soon afterwards turned away, the presumption is that, just at that time, they must have beard the screams of their children behind, and perished in attempting to go to their assistance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="476"/> The building in which the fire originated was, with the exception of a small portion of the rear end, destroyed.
