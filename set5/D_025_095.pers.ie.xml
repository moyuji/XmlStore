<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/> Last night while we were the only brigade of our corps left on the line of the <rs>Rapidan</rs>, near <placeName reg="Raccoon Ford, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2113825">Raccoon ford</placeName>, the enemy, I suppose to cover the retreat of his army, attempted, and succeeded in effecting, the crossing of a large cavalry and artillery force at the ford below us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>A fine charge made upon their flank relieved our force engaged below, and they commenced retrograding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>They did not, however, fail to offer a stubborn resistance, and more than once our cavalry showed signs of giving way.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>Our forces pressed the advantage thus gained, and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, not having succeeded in uniting their whole force, continued to retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>After this was kept up for a while, they were more successful in getting their whole force together, and in the vicinity of <placeName key="tgn,2114382" n="1.000 36" reg="stevensburg, culpeper, virginia">Stevensburg</placeName>, a small village, they drew up their lines in a commanding position and offered us battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>They begin to waver, and, in a moment more, away go their lines to the rear in <num value="1">one</num> confused mass.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/> &#x0022;But his main objection to any bill fixing prices was that it would strike a blow at production itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>When the war commenced our wealth and industry were absorbed in agriculture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>With our ports blockaded we had to look within ourselves to supply a <num value="1000">thousand</num> wants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>Enterprises for supplying these wants were undertaken at great hazard, and are liable to be swept off by the casualties of war. Men would not encounter these risks except without the hope of large profits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>Our ports may soon be hermetically scaled, and the enterprise and ingenuity of our people taxed to the utmost to supply the articles of necessity, such as shoes, clothing, &#x0026;c.--Was this a time to discourage production by placing trammels upon enterprise?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>What man would embark a heavy capital in any undertaking when he must not rely for his profits upon the ordinary laws of trade, but the decision of a <orgName n="Commissioners Board" type="board">Board of Commissioners</orgName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>He had, however, a still stronger objection to any bill fixing prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>He thought that no scheme would work well which was not perfectly uniform in its operation throughout the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>By way of illustration: If you fix the price of cotton cloth at <measure n="1dollars" type="currency">one dollar</measure> per yard in this State, and it is worth <measure n="2.50dollars" type="currency">$2.50</measure> per yard in <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, as the manufacturer in the latter State can afford to pay double the wages, you may bring about an exodus of all the operatives in our factories, and we may have to decide whether it would not be better to pay high prices for cloth than fix low prices and have none to buy. This law would likewise place an embargo upon all importations from other States not adopting the same system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>If cloth is at <measure n="1dollars" type="currency">$1</measure> per yard and wheat at <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">$5</measure> per bushel here, it is not to be expected that these articles will be brought here when the same cloth is <measure n="2.50dollars" type="currency">$2.50</measure> and wheat <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">$10</measure> per bushel in another State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>He thought it would be best to leave trade as unrestrained as the ebb and flow of the tides, and that in tampering with the laws of trade by fixing prices the <name>Legislature</name> would only be repeating foolish experiments, which, whenever tried, have always, in the end, brought ruin upon the producer and want upon the consumer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>He thought it the duty of the <name>Legislature</name> to provide for the destitute families of soldiers, to extend any practical measure of relief to the overrun districts of the <rs>State</rs>, and to strike down the extortioner as they had struck down the gambler; but, in going further, it would only run the risk of adding a <num value="1000">thousand</num> fold to the evils which it was seeking to escape.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="Mr. Bruce"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/> This is the whole question in a nutshell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>It is to us absolutely marvellous that men sent here to make laws for our guidance should persist in shutting their eyes to the obvious truths so clearly exposed in these remarks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>They do this not only in the face of common sense, but of a full knowledge of what is already happening around them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>The millers of this city have established a maximum of their own for wheat, so we learn from other portions of <persName n="Bruce,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00154" reg="mostcommon:Bruce,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Bruce</surname></persName>'s speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>They will pay the <rs>Government</rs> price--<measure n="5dollars" type="currency">five dollars</measure>--and no more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>The consequence is that they get no wheat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>The farmers will not send it at that price.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>It is vain to say that they do not send it because they fear it will be stopped by the <rs>Government</rs> on the way. The Government pays for it quite as much as the millers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>They do not send it because the price is fixed, and because they know that the currency is rapidly depreciating, and that in a month from this time the <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">five dollars</measure> which they receive for a bushel may not buy as much as <measure n="2dollars" type="currency">two dollars</measure> will buy now. They are not sending in their wheat, and they will not send it in, unless a free market be allowed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>This bill, in the violent spirit which distinguishes the times, prescribes oaths and penalties for refusal to send to market at the prices fixed by the <rs>Commissioners</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>These are the old and worn-out expedients of the <name>Jacobins</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>They failed in the hands of those who <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> employed them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>It is not probable that they will succeed in the hands of their disciples.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> effect will be to drive grain to markets beyond the <rs>State</rs>, and if that be prevented, then it will put an end to production.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>No man will produce when the price of his products is to be fixed by a commission, and when it is certain that <sic>that</sic> price will be much below what it would be were the market free. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/> This thing we have often said was thoroughly tried in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> by the <name>Jacobins</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>We produced that example, because it is the most striking in history, and because our proceedings up to this point have been almost identical with those of the <name>Jacobins</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>The Convention established a paper currency without a metallic basis.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>So did our Congress.--The <name>French</name> paper declined with fearful rapidity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>So did ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>As a consequence, commodities ran to fabulous prices in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>So they did here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>The people of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> attributed the rise to forestallers, speculators, and brokers; and so did our people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>Riots broke out in <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> in consequence of the high prices and consequent scarcity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/><num value="1">One</num> riot has already occurred here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>The Convention endeavored to remedy the evil by a <hi rend="italics">maximum.</hi> So the <name>Legislature</name> is trying to do here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>The <hi rend="italics">maximum</hi> produced untold misery in all the great towns in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, and the entire ruin of the agricultural interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>So it will here if this bill be passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>Are there, in all history, <measure n="2cases" type="mass">two cases</measure> more entirely parallel, as far as our case has gone, and what reason is there to think that the parallel will fail in that which is to come after the law shall have been passed?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>It is to warn our Legislature of the danger into which it is rushing that we allude so often to this example, the most striking and the most fearful on record.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>Thus far they have followed most exactly in the footsteps of the <name>Jacobins</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>Can there be any doubt that they will find the same abyss at the end of their career? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/> There are philosophers among us who affect to despise, and probably do despise, the lessons of history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>It might be enough to say of this class that though they may be philosophers they are hardly statesmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>But they deserve more than a passing notice from the eagerness with which some of their views have been taken up by others whom the caprice of the people, or a strange fatality, has placed in the councils of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>Unable to overcome by argument the bearing which the <name>Jacobin</name> policy has upon that which they propose for this State, they evade it by saying that the <rs>French</rs> are not like us &mdash; that they are an excitable, inflammable people &mdash; and that what happened to them in consequence of certain measures bearing directly on the private interest of every man in the country cannot happen to us from the very same measures, because, forsooth, we are a law-abiding people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>What can be the meaning of all this?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>We assert that this law of the maximum will stop production, because it is directed against the individual interest of every man in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>Do the <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> people of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, because they are a law-abiding people, love their property less than other people?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>Can they be made to work at a dead loss any the sooner because they are a law-abiding people?--Will they not desire to sell their products at the best prices because they are a law-abiding people?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>If any man have any doubt upon this subject, let him go into any quarter of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and take his observations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>He will see how powerfully the lust of gain has taken possession of the minds of all classes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>Why, <persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00155" reg="nearbymention:Davis,Thomas,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> but the other day took occasion in a public letter to deplore this very evil, which has spread like a leprosy over the whole Confederacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>Do we not see that <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> is already beginning to suffer, because the farmers will not send forward their grain, to be sold under the millers' maximum?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>And when compulsory laws shall have been passed, is it to be supposed that men so deeply tainted with the disease of avarice will not try every method to evade the requisition? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/> There is but <num value="1">one</num> way left to ensure supplies, and that is to leave the market to regulate itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>The nominal prices may be fabulous, but there is no choice but between fabulous prices and destitution of the article.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>Trade cannot be coerced, even upon the <name>Chinese</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>The moment you take from a man the right to dispose of his own productions, that moment you take from him the desire to produce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>Were it not that the mischief to result from the passage of this bill is of too serious a character to be made the subject of a mere experiment, we should wish it to pass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>We venture to say that those now the most clamorous for the law would soon be found most anxious for its repeal. </p> </div3>
