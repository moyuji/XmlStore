<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> it was known that a large force of the enemy was crossing to this side of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName> on their pontoons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>From <num value="2">two</num> to <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 3">three corps</orgName>, it was supposed, crossed in the darkness, and yesterday morning a very large wagon train followed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>As that object must be as well known to the rebel Chiefs as it is to our authorities, else the <rs>Colonel</rs> would have abused their hospitably, it is difficult to see how the visit to the rebel capital could further it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Large farms have thus been wholly robbed of labor, and the crops now go to waste.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/> How often are we called upon to mourn the loss of our departed friends, who are the victims of disease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>A as!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>that is a sad bereavement; but when we contemplate the cause of the sudden departure of the subject of this obituary, our hearts are filled with desponded sadness, only imagined by those who have experienced similar evictions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>The deceased was a member of the <num value="18" type="ordinal">18th</num> N C Regiment, and among the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> who left their homes for the defence of their country; at which time he was severely wounded, but fortunately recovered sufficiently to retain to the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>He had been with his regiment but a few months when he labored with a heart rending trial &mdash; the death of his father.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>The widowed heart of his devoted mother yearned more earnestly for her darling boy. She had reluctantly relinquished <num value="1">one</num> son on the battle field, but when her <name n="God" type="God">heavenly father</name> deprived her of her companion, and in so short a time, the awful news reached her that her last son, the darling of her heart, the pride of her bosons, was no more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>Had she not reason to conclude her cup of trouble was full to the brim?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>Yes, it is difficult to realize that he is dead; but we have a great consolation to support us in his lamentable death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>He was a Christian; professed conversion during the last revival at <orgName n="Trinity Church" type="church">Trinity Church</orgName> of this city, and connected him self with <placeName reg="Dr Moore's Church">Dr Moore's Church</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>He was an exemplary <name>Christian</name> soldier; not only brave as regards the temporal field, but acted his part admirably in the <rs>Christian</rs> conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>He was a kind friend, affectionate brother, and devoted and obedient son. To the mourning family we would say, think of him as a bright angel, awaiting to welcome you.--Think not of him as dead, but gently resting in the tender arms of an ever-watchful and loving.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>Saviour. To his afflicted mother &mdash; ah!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>who feels the pans so keenly &mdash; remember, he has gone only a short white before you, it is true; he was in the opening of noble manhood, and an ornament to society; but will he not shine as a gem among the glorified angels which inherit the land of hope and love!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>Yes, our friend died on the field of battle, and was there buried.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>Many are there who mourn the ross of their comrade, who saw him on the gory field, deprived of the soft touch of a sister's hand, to remove the cold dew from his brow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>No fond mother to imprint the last kiss upon those pallid lips.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>Farewell, dear friend, when our pilgrimage closes on earth, may it be our lot to share with thee the eternal joys of Heaven. </p>

<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/> Forget thee!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>'tis a bitter word &mdash; I would it were unsaid. </p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/> I then may cease to think of thee, as earthily mortals do; </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/> But my friend, thus slain in battle, grieves my heart from day to day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/> Far away from home he died, in manhood's bright and early bloom; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/> The noble brow, but mangled form, lies silent in the tomb. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/> His lifeless form now fills the <rs>Christian</rs> soldier's grave, </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/> Around him numbers lie, companions in the strife, Which chilled his manly heart and bore away his life. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/> He's gone &mdash; the bright example of his life's career should guide the hearts herein, and stay the failing tear; </p>
