<head>The <rs n="Battle of Gettysburg" type="battle">battle of Gettysburg</rs></head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> It is difficult to say, from the accounts which we publish to-day, (all <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>, of course) what portion, or whether all of our army was engaged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>We presume, however, that it was only a portion, as the main body is supposed not to be in the immediate neighborhood of <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> It is evident to us, at any rate, that our troops have grinned a great victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The <orgName n="Philadelphia Inquirer" type="newspaper">Philadelphia <hi rend="italics">Inquirer</hi></orgName> cannot conceal the fact, although it lies with an order and an earnestness that deserved better success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>We are told, in the first place, that &#x0022;our troops&#x0022;--to wit, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> troops &mdash; maintained their position in <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName>, in spite of the most obstinate attempts on the part of the rebels to capture it. A paragraph or <num value="2">two</num> lower, we are told that at the &#x0022;end of the battle&#x0022; the rebel cavalry made a dash through the town, capturing all the sick and wounded, stores, &#x0026;c. Now, dashing through a town, which the enemy has held during a severe battle, to ordinary comprehensions, certainly means that the town was carried and left in the rear by the victorious party in their pursuit of a flying enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Again, we are told that the &#x0022;rebels&#x0022; were triumphantly beaten back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>But a little farther on we discover that towards the close of the action these same &#x0022;rebels&#x0022; made an attack upon <num value="1">one</num> of the enemy's flanks, and that he fell back a mile, fighting valiantly, of course, as <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> always do--<hi rend="italics">on paper.</hi>--Lastly, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> say the affair is &#x0022;indecisive,&#x0022; which is proof enough that they have been badly beaten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Had it--<hi rend="italics">really</hi> been indecisive, they would have claimed a decided victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>It is only necessary to remember what <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> did at <placeName reg="Sharpsburg, Washington, Maryland" key="tgn,7014501">Sharpsburg</placeName> to be convinced of this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>That affair was anything <hi rend="italics">but</hi> indecisive <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> was beaten with immense slaughter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>He retreated in the night, and the next day <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> could hear nothing of him; although he shelled all the woods in the neighborhood to start him from his covert.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Had <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> followed him, beyond a question he would have continued his retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>But the force of that General was too feeble, in comparison with the enormous <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army, to justify the risk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>After holding the battle field <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure> he withdrew, and <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, learning the fact by his scouts, sneaked up, occupied it, and wrote: &#x0022;I think I may <hi rend="italics">now </hi> say that we really have gained a victory.&#x0022; He was so crippled, in the meantime, that he would not follow, and was removed for not doing what was impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Can any <num value="1">one</num> doubt, after this, that when the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> say an affair is indecisive, they are in fact badly whipped? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> But if they are not whipped, why do they shout so vociferously for reinforcements? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> The <orgName n="Baltimore American" type="newspaper">Baltimore <hi rend="italics">American</hi></orgName> tells us that up to Thursday they had <measure n="6000" type="captured">captured 6,000</measure> prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>but it accounts for only <num value="800">800</num>, although <persName n="Schenck,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Schenck,Gen,,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Schenck</surname></persName> announces that <num value="1500">1,500</num> more were to come on. On Thursday there was no general battle, but heavy skirmishing, in which <measure n="5000" type="prisoners">5,000 prisoners</measure>, making <num value="11000">11,000</num> in all, were captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The gallant <rs>Dutchmen</rs> who distinguished themselves by running so at <placeName key="tgn,7017621" n="1.000 260" reg="chancellorsville, spotsylvania, virginia">Chancellorsville</placeName>, it seems, demolished <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName> and captured a <measure n="1000" type="prisoners">thousand prisoners</measure>. These lies are for gross even for <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> credulity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> The fact seems to be that a <hi rend="italics">division</hi> of the army has kept the whole <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> force at bay <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure>, and that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> is rapidly concentrating in the neighborhood of Gettysburg In a few days we expect to hear that <orgName n="army"><persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="nearbymention:Meade,George,G.,,"><surname>Meade</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> has been defeated, and probably annihilated. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Whether, like <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName>, he is to be sent to hunting <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indians</rs>, or, like <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>, to console himself for his inability to cope with armed men by persecuting and hanging the defenceless and non-combatant, remains to be seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>As for the luckless <rs>McClellan</rs>, there seems no prospect of resurrection.
