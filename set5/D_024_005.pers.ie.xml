<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>The Northern news published this morning contains some important statements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>The papers state their loss at <placeName reg="Murfreesboro, Rutherford, Tennessee" key="tgn,7014175">Murfreesboro</placeName>' to be <num value="30000">30,000</num> in killed and wounded, and acknowledge the less of their tremendous wagon train, <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00232" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,A.,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> has, in accordance with his promise, issued his emancipation proclamation, which has caused much ridicule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>The Monitor, the &#x0022;hope of the navy,&#x0022; as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> papers called her, is reported to have gone down in a storm off Cape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>Another account states that only <num value="30">thirty</num> men were lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>She was bound for <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>This report comes from <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName>, where it was received <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>There is a very strong position beginning with <placeName reg="Shelbyville, Bedford, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101476">Shelbyville</placeName> on the left, extending across the railroad running from <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName> to <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, at or near its junction with the <placeName reg="Shelbyville, Bedford, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101476">Shelbyville</placeName> road, with its centre at a place called <persName n="Decker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00236" reg="mostcommon:Decker,nomatch:0"><surname>Decker</surname></persName>'s, and its right terminating in the <name>Cumber</name> land Mountains &mdash; the whole distance being <measure n="25miles" type="distance">twenty-five miles</measure> from left to right, which, we understand, military men thought last summer ought to be the place to defend <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/> It may be that <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00237" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName> has fallen back to this position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>If he has, all is right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>But if he has merely gotten out of the way, with the design to go to reinforce the army facing <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00238" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, which <measure n="300miles" type="distance">three hundred miles</measure> off, then <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> Tennessee</placeName> is in great danger, if <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00239" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> wishes to take it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/> The <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName> says the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> lost <num value="20000">20,000</num> men in the battle of the <num value="31" type="ordinal">31st</num>, but were victorious!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>That is a lie on the face of it. There is no doubt that our men beat the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, as they always do &mdash; as they did at <placeName reg="Perryville, Boyle, Kentucky" key="tgn,7017532">Perryville</placeName> last summer &mdash; and that <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00240" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName> has repeated the game he played then; that is to say, he has become alarmed at his own success and run away from it. <num value="1">One</num> would think <sic>that</sic> memorable example would have been enough. </p> </div3>

<head>The peace rumors.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/> Whenever our armies win a battle, we forthwith hear a <num value="1000">thousand</num> rumors of approaching peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>Such rumor sure particularly rife just at this moment, when they have just won a couple.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>We wish we could see any just ground for believing peace near, but we confess we see none whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>Our victories around <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> were followed, on the part of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00241" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,A.,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, by a call for <num value="300000">300,000</num> additional men, and this call was succeeded, in a very short time, by another <num value="300000">300,000</num> more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>The whole <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> force, on paper, since the beginning of the war is <num value="1200">twelve hundred</num> <num value="1000">thousand</num> men. Of these, we are told, about <num value="350000">three hundred and fifty thousand</num> have been slaughtered or put <hi rend="italics">hors de combat,</hi> so that, on paper, there are now about <num value="850000">850,000</num> men. A contemporary disposed of nearly half of these as deserters, or sick, or otherwise absent from their colors; so that only about <num value="450000">450,000</num> are left to do the fighting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>Yet this is a tremendous army, and as, thus far, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> feel perfectly safe at home, they can send it all here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>And they will send it all here, and we shall not be able to obtain peace until we shall have slaughtered at least half of it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/> It should be recollected that none of our victories, though glorious to those who gained them, have been decisive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>We have struck many hard blows; but we have not yet annihilated an army, or rendered it so inefficient that it could molest us no more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>There has been no <placeName reg="Austerlitz, Bourbon, Kentucky" key="tgn,2037561">Austerlitz</placeName> no Jenna, no <placeName reg="Waterloo, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2753461">Waterloo</placeName>, in any of our campaigns; and though our victories have been of great importance to us, they have failed to dishearten the enemy and to convince him that the undertaking he is engaged in is hopeless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>We must do this before we can hope for peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>There is every reason to believe that it will be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>Every battle has been won by us, and we may therefore set it down as established that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are not a match for us in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>The day of decisive victory &mdash; victory producing great immediate results &mdash; victory so unmistakable as to convince the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> mind that there is no hope &mdash; must come; but it has not come yet. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/> We shall be compelled to meet the preparations the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are making for the spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>Of that we may rest assured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>They are on a scale of the most stupendous magnitude, but they can be neutralized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>Let us do this &mdash; let us prove that the present armament can do nothing to subjugate us and we feel well assured that they will never raise another of the same size.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>But we must, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> of all, meet it, and beat it. In order to do so not the slightest realization in recruiting our ranks must be allowed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>The conscription must go on as though we were in the most desperate extremities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>We must have an army in the field as nearly as possible approaching that of the enemy in numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>We are happy to believe that this is being done with great strictness and regularity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>Let it be done thoroughly and completely, and we shall find it the best and surest means of obtaining peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>Beat their armies thoroughly this spring, and they will soon <num value="1">one</num> for peace; for no man is willing to make war only to be beaten. </p> </div3>

If he wanted to know in advance what would be the effect of his prominent proclamation, he has probably by this time <unclear>ally</unclear> enlightened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>The South does not <unclear></unclear> his manifesto with words. &#x0022;She leans upon her bloodstained sword,&#x0022; indifferent alike whether he oils his speech with soft, conservative blarney, or whether he bowls forth the threats of the incendiary and murderer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>When he comes near enough, she strikes, and sends his myrmidons reeling back, bloody and dying, to their master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>So far as his promising of a <placeName reg="Republicana Dominicana" key="tgn,7005388">St. Domingo</placeName> campaign is expected to intimidate our people, he may decide whether the late battles give any taken of such influence so far as it is designed to operate upon the servile population, he might as well proclaim emancipation to the serfs in <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>When he undertaken to give practical operation to his policy, by organizing and sending among us negro regiments, we shall knew how to deal with such an emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>It will, then, be a literal hoisting of &#x0022;the black flag&#x0022; by his own hands, and his sable standard will not be recognized as entitled to the protection of the rules of civilized war. The black barbarians will be dealt with according to the <rs>State</rs> laws already in existence for such offences and their white companions will be subjected to the same capital punishment. </p>
