<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> <persName n="Sumner,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName>'s theory that the &#x0022;insurrectionary States&#x0022; have forfeited their State attributes, and are now mere territorial domain, has justly been repelled as inconsistent with the whole scheme of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>But even that theory is preferable to any project of keeping the functions of these States in indefinite suspension, and excluding them from all representation in the <orgName n="National Legislature" type="legislature">National Legislature</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Treat these States as Territories, and they may at least, like other Territories, send each a delegate to the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>, who, though not voting, would have the privilege of speaking and representing the feelings and wishes of his constituents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>In the present condition of things, these so-called States have not even a Territorial life; every <num value="1">one</num> of them is as voiceless in the national halls as if it were forever dead, and resolved into its primitive dust again. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> It was but right for the <rs type="place">House</rs> to ignore all representatives from the theatre of the late rebellion until it could be shown that their elections were made under competent authority and in a proper way. It is well, too, to stop to inquire whether the late insurrectionary States, in seeking again the constitutional right of representation, are prepared to comply with all their constitutional obligations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>But all this can be learned without any great delay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/><persName n="Johnson,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Johnson,Reverdy,,,:1"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName> doubtless has abundant information, derived from his provisional governors, and from agents deputed to make special inquiry, which he will cheerfully impart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>If that information is not enough, any deficiency can easily be supplied by an invitation of the <rs>Southern Representatives</rs> to present themselves before the committee of <num value="15">fifteen</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Unquestionably they could make expositions of the condition of the <rs>South</rs>, and of the present sentiments of the people, that would quickly clear up every uncertain point, and enable the committee to report, at an early day, with the fullest understanding. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> The true policy is to expedite rather than delay the re-admission of the <rs>Southern Representatives</rs> and <rs>Senators</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>It is neither right nor safe for any part of the country to legislate for another part of the country without giving it any voice in that legislation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Representation is the vital principle of <rs n="Republican" type="political">republican</rs> institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Its denial to any extent impairs the normal operation of our government, and opens the way to all kinds of abuses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>No <num value="1">one</num> thing is so important as to rid the <rs>South</rs> of that old spirit of sectionalism, which was the growth of slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The great effort of true statesmanship now must be to animate the <rs>South</rs> with a new life, which shall be thoroughly identified with the national life, and have a complete community of spirit with the <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>West</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>But this will be morally impossible if discriminations are to be kept up against the <rs>South</rs>, especially the extremest of all discriminations of not allowing it representation, and making it subject to laws in the framing of which it has had no part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>That will be sure to beget a sense of most grievous oppression, and the result would inevitably be the intensest hatred, on the part of the <rs>Southern</rs> people, of those they deemed their oppressors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>To shut they the eyes to this certainty is to be blind to <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Whatever the motive, the act is <num value="1">one</num> of infatuation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/> The South is now in its most impressible stage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>All Southern men are waiting to see how Southern submission will be treated by the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Of the fair and conciliatory disposition of <persName n="Johnson,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Johnson,Reverdy,,,:1"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName> they are well satisfied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Yet he is but a single man. Of the spirit of the <rs>Northern</rs> people toward them they are still in doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Any unfriendly manifestation by Northern <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> and Representatives will be taken as proof that the <rs>Northern</rs> people have no desire again to fraternize with them, and mean only to be their masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>An unmistakably generous and magnanimous policy by Congress, in admitting their Representatives and burying the past, would soon overcome their last lingering resentment, and expunge the last trace of that sense of humiliation, which cannot exist without bitterness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>A jealous and rigorous line of treatment would, on the other hand, soon congeal every better impulse of the <rs>Southern</rs> people into an inflexible determination to oppose and thwart the <rs>Government</rs> in every practicable way, and would perpetuate the spirit of sectionalism in its worst form for years, and perhaps generations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/> Some say that the new loyalty of the <rs>South</rs> is still very defective &mdash; that it consists in profession mainly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>We can hardly concede this to be exactly so; but if this Southern loyalty is yet immature, it is the very reason why it should be encouraged and strengthened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>We have not a doubt that the predominant feeling in the <rs>Northern</rs> heart to-day toward the <rs>South</rs> is a yearning for complete reconciliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>It would be a blessed influence upon the <rs>Southern</rs> people if they could truly know this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>But they cannot know it, except through the words and actions of Northern Congressmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Let those Representatives look well to it that they do not give occasion for a misconception of the real spirit of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>They cannot long continue to keep the gates of the <placeName reg="Capitol, Salt Lake, Utah" key="tgn,2220712">capitol</placeName> barred against all Southern representation without producing upon the <rs>Southern</rs> mind a most mischievous impression, that the <rs>North</rs> means not to be reconciled, but to domineer and degrade. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/> What harm can Southern representation do?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Even supposing the worst, that it would be disaffected and factious, it would still form but a weak minority in either <persName n="House,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="mostcommon:House,nomatch:0"><surname>House</surname></persName>; and even if it made an alliance with all the <rs>Democratic</rs> strength, the combined force would still be less than <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".2">fifths</num> of either body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>The <num value="39" type="ordinal">Thirty-ninth</num> Congress, upon which devolves the completion of this work of reconstruction, has a magnificent Union strength, which no possible combination of malign elements can hinder from working its own high will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>Let it trust to that strength, and be fearlessly generous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Let it admit, at an early day, into its bosom all the truly accredited Representatives of the <rs>Southern</rs> people, so that it shall have every facility to legislate intelligently and justly for the <rs>South</rs>, as well as for every other part of the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>This is what is imperatively demanded by the spirit of national concord and by every practical interest of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>No speculative dogma, or old resentment, ought to stand in the way of it. </p> </div4> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/> The &#x0022;destitute ration,&#x0022; which has been the solitary dependence of so many of our people for their daily bread, ceased on yesterday.; and it is ascertained that there are now in this city <num value="3046">three thousand and forty-six</num> women and children entirely destitute, with the rigors of winter upon them, and nothing between them and death but charity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/> The fact is appalling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>It carries its own appeal with it. Words cannot convey its inexpressible horror.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>Many of these persons, threatened with an awful fate, have never, in former days, known want.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>Not a few of them are delicate, refined, gently bred, possessed of every household virtue and adorned by every social grace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>Something must be done, and done quickly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>The whole head and heart of the community must be devoted to instant, practical, thorough measures for their relief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>We had never expected to see such a state of things in <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>; least of all, in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/> Among the many subjects which it was the custom of the <hi rend="italics">Dispatch,</hi> in the days before the war, to keep habitually before the public, there was no <num value="1">one</num>, the importance of which to the future welfare of the <rs>State</rs> it esteemed so transcendent as the engagement entered into by the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James River</placeName> and <orgName n="Kanawha Company" type="company">Kanawha Company</orgName> with a French Association, represented in this country by <persName n="De,,M.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00053" reg="default:De,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>De</surname></persName> <persName n="Minieres,,Bellot,,,de" id="n-0001.0000.00000.00054" reg="expanded:Minieres,Bellot,,,"><foreName>Bellot</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Minieres</surname></persName>, for the transfer of its interest in that great improvement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>As the events of the last <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> may very naturally have somewhat impaired the reader's memory of those transactions, we will give a brief summary of the whole affair down to the present time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/> It cannot be forgotten that the private stockholders agreed to transfer all their rights to the company in question upon their undertaking to begin the improvement within a certain period (<measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure>, we believe), and to complete it in <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure>, and upon their depositing in <num value="1">one</num> of the banks the sum of <measure n="500000dollars" type="currency">$500,000</measure>, or <measure n="1000000dollars" type="currency">$1,000,000</measure>, we forget which.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>To obtain a transfer of the interest of the <rs>State</rs>, legislative intervention was necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>Accordingly, a petition was presented to that body, and a charter, based upon the charter of the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James River</placeName> and <orgName n="Kanawha Company" type="company">Kanawha Company</orgName>, with certain modifications, was granted to the <orgName n="French Company" type="company">French Company</orgName> only <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> before the <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName> seceded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>In it was a provise that the work should be commenced within a certain period, and completed within <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure>, provided such commencement and completion were not rendered impossible by the occurrence of war. War did occur, not by any act of the <orgName n="French Company" type="company">French Company</orgName>, but in consequence of the act of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> herself, that State having seceded from the <rs>Union</rs> <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> after the passage of the charter, as we have already said. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/> No sooner had peace been re-established than the <orgName n="French Company" type="company">French Company</orgName> commenced an active correspondence with the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James River</placeName> and <orgName n="Kanawha Company" type="company">Kanawha Company</orgName>, in which they professed themselves ready and anxious to proceed immediately to the fulfilment of their contract.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>Since it was impossible to have commenced the work during the war, and since the war was not brought on by any act or omission of theirs, they hold that their not having done so within the time stipulated, does not work any forfeiture of their right to begin now. And they say the same thing with regard to the time within which they were limited to complete the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>But <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> remain, if their <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure> are to be dated from <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>; but they claim the whole <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure>, dated from the time when they shall begin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>This is all very reasonable, and we presume no objection will be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>The Company claim that the <rs>State</rs> has already granted them an absolute and indefeasible charter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>We think so, too; and we think, moreover, that such would be the decision of any court of justice-upon earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>Nevertheless, <persName n="Peirpoint,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00055" reg="mostcommon:Peirpoint,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Peirpoint</surname></persName> thought that some further legislation was necessary, and the matter is again before the <name>Legislature</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>We will not allow ourselves to believe that the decision can be for a moment doubtful. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/> It is proper to say that <persName n="Paul,,M.,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00056" reg="default:Paul,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Paul</surname></persName>, the <rs>French Consul</rs> at this port, has made several official calls upon the <rs>President</rs> of the <rs>Company</rs> since the return of peace, with the view of obtaining information, and expressing the deep interest which he was instructed to say was felt in official quarters at home in the progress of the affair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>On <num value="2">two</num> occasions he had received instructions from <persName n="Montholon,,M.,,,de" id="n-0001.0000.00000.00057" reg="expanded:Montholon,M.,,,"><foreName>M.</foreName> <nameLink>de</nameLink> <surname>Montholon</surname></persName>, the <rs>French Minister</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, to say that the <rs>French Government</rs> felt the deepest solicitude with regard to the undertaking, and would back it with all its moral influence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/> We have lately heard from high <hi rend="italics">political</hi> authority that the scheme of uniting the waters of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName> with those of the <rs>Kanawha</rs> is <hi rend="italics">impracticable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/></hi> We do not believe <num value="1">one</num> word of it. If the <placeName reg="Alps" key="tgn,7007746">Alps</placeName> can be tunneled, we do not see why the <rs>Alleghany</rs> may not be. Money can do anything in the way of engineering, and this Company has a capital of <num value="30000000">thirty millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>So many of these <hi rend="italics">impossible</hi> things have been done of late years, that the word <hi rend="italics">impossible,</hi> in its modern sense, hardly means even <hi rend="italics">very difficult.</hi> The wise men in Parliament said it was impossible to make a train run <measure n="10miles" type="distance">ten miles</measure> an hour, and denounced <persName n="Stephenson,,George,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00058" reg="default:Stephenson,George,,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Stephenson</surname></persName> as a liar and <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> braggart for affirming that it could; and <persName n="Lardner,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00059" reg="mostcommon:Lardner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Lardner</surname></persName> pronounced steam navigation of the <rs>Atlantic</rs> to be impossible, in a public lecture, not more than a month before the <rs>Great Western</rs> made her trial trip.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>To say that a thing is impossible, is, in such cases, merely to say &#x0022;I am no engineer.&#x0022; The very <rs>Alleghanies</rs> themselves can be dug down if there be money enough to pay for the job. The question, and the only question is, is the treasure in view so great that the <rs>Company</rs> will go to any very great expense about it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>We answer, it is. The Company itself owns immense bodies of coal land in <placeName key="tgn,1125392" n="1.000 13" reg="kanawha, west virginia, united states">Kanawha</placeName>, which will become enormously valuable &mdash; every foot of it &mdash; as soon as a route sufficiently cheap can be opened to the <rs>Atlantic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>This is <num value="1">one</num> item: In <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> there is no coal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/><placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> is increasing in manufactures.

Now, the <orgName n="French Company" type="company">French Company</orgName> maintain that, with this water line, they can place upon the wharves at St. Nazaire <num value="1000000">millions</num> of tons of the best cannel coal, which they can sell much cheaper than <name>English</name> coal can be bought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>Again, the <rs type="place">Chesapeake and Ohio Canal</rs> and the <rs type="place">Erie Canal</rs> are already closed, and will remain so until next Spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>This proposed water line would not be closed <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> in the year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>It would therefore prove a most formidable rival of those improvements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>It brings more, by <num value="1">one hundred per cent.</num>, into the city than all the railroads put together that enter the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>This little canal <hi rend="italics">here</hi> brings fully as much as all the railroads combined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>We wish to see the railroads pushed out as far to the <rs>West</rs> as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>They are the handmaids of such a canal as this ought to be. They flourish better together, and ought to be as inseparable as man and wife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>But no railroad, or combination of railroads, can give us what the water line will give. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/> The <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName> at present calls loudly for labor and capital, and the only means to obtain that element is by immigration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>The question how to attract immigration at present is the subject which I wish to bring before you. Several of the <rs>Northern</rs> and Western States have employed commissioners and State immigration agents to aid them in that enterprise, and some of them propose to supply the <rs>Southern States</rs> from the surplus they obtain, thereby imposing a tariff on the emigrant who comes South.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>It is well known both in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="Scotland" key="tgn,7002444">Scotland</placeName> that the fearful struggle of the late war disorganized the whole labor of the <rs>South</rs>, and that the opening to skill, industry, and capital, presents at present more favorable inducements than at any period of the history of this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>The question, therefore, with the foreigner is, how to choose his location, and from what source he is to obtain information to enable him to decide, and after having chosen it, to be protected from the temptations on the way to his destination. </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>A very small sum would suffice for this object, say <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">$500</measure>. An office should be opened in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, where a registry should be kept, where the emigrant's name and description would be recorded, and where the employers of labor could find supply. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/> From the <orgName n="Montana Post" type="newspaper">Montana Post</orgName>, <date value="11-11">November 11.</date>On <persName n="Meagher,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00357" reg="mostcommon:Meagher,nomatch:0"><surname>Meagher</surname></persName>'s Bar, opposite <placeName reg="Nevada" key="tgn,7007526">Nevada</placeName>, have been discovered fossils that unmistakably prove that this part of the world was, at <num value="1">one</num> time, inhabited by a race of human beings who stood, in maturity, from <num value="10">ten</num> to <measure n="12feet" type="distance">twelve feet</measure> high; and by a species of quadruped at least twice as large as the <name>Asiatic</name> elephant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>They were imbedded about <measure n="8feet" type="distance">eight feet</measure> in what might be termed a close diluvial deposit, and in what the configuration of the country indicates was once the eddy of a river. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/> As an evidence of the former, we now have before us the jaw-bone &mdash; anatomically termed the inferior maxillary &mdash; of a biped which is almost double the size of an ordinary human jaw-bone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>From point to point of the condyle &mdash; the upper projections, where junction is made with the corresponding parts above &mdash; this fossil measures fully <measure n="5inches" type="distance">five inches</measure>. It is in a perfect state of preservation &mdash; so perfect that, had it been of ordinary size <num value="1">one</num> would have supposed that its owner had not made his (or her) exit from this &#x0022;vale of tears&#x0022; over <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> ago. The enamel of the teeth still remains bright and uninjured by the action of fire, water or air. Not a tooth is lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>They comprise <num value="6">six</num> grinders or molars (the usual number) and <num value="10">ten</num> others &mdash; being <num value="16">sixteen</num> in all. They have been much worn by the labor of mastication, which fact proves that this <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Goliath did not cease to use them until they had prepared for his stomach the food of many years &mdash; perhaps not until the other functions of his physical organization had weakened from old age, when the utility of the teeth ceased, though decay had not yet marked them by a single perforation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>The fact is also a good conjectural argument, that this being belonged to a race similar in their habits to the existing tribes of natives, who, even in their old age, are notable for the fine state of their teeth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>The jaw-bone is the only portion of the remains we have seen; but ribs and other bones were found near the spot, which undoubtedly belonged to the same individual, as they are all of proportionate size.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>It has been estimated by members of the medical fraternity here that the height of this biped could not have been less than <num value="10.5">ten and a half</num>, and might have reached <measure n="12feet" type="distance">twelve feet</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/> Why, we will be asked, do we suppose these human bones to be the remains of an extinct race?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>We answer, it is a conclusion fairly arrived at by inductive reasoning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>It is true, among existing races, there are instances recorded of men reaching the height of over <measure n="8feet" type="distance">eight feet</measure>, but the record is not positive of any reaching over <measure n="9feet" type="distance">nine feet</measure>. The science of &#x0022;comparative anatomy&#x0022; need not be deeply studied to prove that these fossils belonged to a being be more than <measure n="10feet" type="distance">ten feet</measure> high.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>If this being belonged to the existing races, and was a sort of lusrus natur&#x00E6;, or <num value="1">one</num> individual of tremendous proportions among whole nations of the common statue, is it not somewhat surprising that his (or her) gigantic bones should be exhumed in the heart of the continent, having distinctive physical prominence among <num value="1000000">millions</num>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>Why was not <num value="1">one</num> of the myriads of smaller frames, from which the vital spark had fled before and fled after him, found instead?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>The <rs>Caucasian</rs> is put down as the tallest of the <num value="5">five</num> divisions of the human family.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>There is not <num value="1">one</num> of this race on record, that we are aware of, who attained to a height of near <measure n="11feet" type="distance">eleven feet</measure>. Such an anomaly might happen; but if it should, many generations would most probably come and go without a parallel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>Judging from its size alone, we think the chance of this jaw-bone having belonged to <num value="1">one</num> of the <rs>North</rs> <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> race is as <num value="1">one</num> for to many <num value="1000000">millions</num> against.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>But the concomitant circumstances of a fossil having been found with it, which we know is not referable to any species now existing in <placeName reg="America, Pulaski, Illinois" key="tgn,2026331">America</placeName>, strengthens the theory that in this jaw-bone we have the evidence of a race of human beings that has &#x0022;gone flickering among the things that were.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/> The proof of an extinct race of quadrupeds, or of a species at least, that were twice as large as any now extant, is the discovery of an enormous molar tooth, which was found along with a monster jaw-bone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>The crown or top of this tooth measures, the longer way, exactly <measure n="6inches" type="distance">six inches</measure>, and it is <num value="4">four</num> in width; the root, or the part invested by or sunk below the gum, measures over <measure n="7inches" type="distance">seven inches</measure>.
