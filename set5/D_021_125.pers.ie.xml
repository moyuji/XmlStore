<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> The <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName> correspondent of the <orgName n="Philadelphia Inquirer" type="newspaper">Philadelphia <hi rend="italics">Inquirer</hi></orgName>, under date of <date value="05-18">May 18th,</date> sends the following: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> The great anxiety which has prevailed here for a week past to hear from the expedition up <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName> has at last been gratified. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> This afternoon the little <rs>Naugatuck</rs> was descried coming down the <rs type="place">Roads</rs>, and immediately the anxious ones hurried to the beach to ask whether <q>&#x0022;the <rs>Monitor</rs> was shelling <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>? &#x0022;</q> </p> </q><bibl n="correspondent of the Philadelphia Inquirer"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> Having conversed with <num value="1">one</num> of the officers of the <rs>Naugatuck</rs>, I am enabled to give you the following interesting particulars: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> Last <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> the <term type="ship">Monitor</term>, <rs type="ship">Galena</rs>, and Naugatuck, started for the rebel capital via <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>They were soon followed by the <rs type="place">Aroustock and Port Royal</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> They silenced several of the batteries which lined the snore, and passed some with the most contemptuous silence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> The <rs>Captain</rs> of the <rs>Monitor</rs> stood upon the turret and waved his cap to a battery which he considered unworthy of the notice of his pet, although <num value="3">three</num> balls struck the <unclear>M </unclear> turret with considerable force. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> The progress of the fleet was a continued success until they arrived to within about <placeName><distance reg="7miles">seven miles</distance> of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Here the river takes a sharp turn around a propitious bluff fully <measure n="150feet" type="distance">one hundred and fifty feet</measure> in <unclear><persName n="Leight,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Leight,nomatch:0"><surname>Leight</surname></persName>.</unclear>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> Upon the top of this bluff the rebels have erected a most scientific and formidable battery, mounting many guns of superior range and calibre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>This battery commands the river in the most effective manner and its on became evident to our fleet that an engagement of no ordinary character was imminent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> On last <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, at <time value="7oclock">seven o'clock</time>, our fleet formed their line of battle, and commenced the reduction of the <name n="Confederate States">rebel</name> stronghold. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>From the unusual elevation of the battery, and the difficulty our men experienced in getting the proper range they were for a time unable to do any execution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>In the mean-time the battery poured an <hi rend="italics">incessant fire of shell and ball</hi> down upon the decks of our vessels, and did a <hi rend="italics">fearful work!</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> The <rs>Naugatuck</rs>, after several brilliant shots, burst her <num value="100">one hundred</num>-pound rifled <name type="weapon">Parrott gun</name>, killing the gunner and wounding several others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Having no other armament, except <num value="2">two</num> boarding howitzers, and being thus disabled, she withdrew from the engagement. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> The <rs>Galena</rs> suffered, severally &mdash; the rebel shots riddling her deck with great ease, and several of the balls entering her side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/><num value="14">Fourteen</num> of her crew were killed and <measure n="13" type="wounded">thirteen wounded</measure>; the majority of the latter, however, will recover.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Those who were killed are terribly cut and mangled &mdash; some beyond the hope of recognition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>For <num value="1">one</num> hour the <rs>Galena</rs> was exposed to the entire fire of the rebel battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>On account of the narrowness of the channel, she could not <q>&#x0022;spring&#x0022;</q> or turn so as to work to advantage. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> The Monitor, however, maintained her superior strength and invulnerability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The balls glanced harmless from her tower of strength, and fell into the placid waters of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>For sometime she labored under the greatest difficulty in acquiring the requisite elevation for her guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>But having once obtained it, she poured her missiles with fearful effect upon the battery, and thus encouraging her associates, the fleet belched forth such an iron half that the battery was silenced for <num value="3">three</num> quarters of an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>At this juncture our vessels <hi rend="italics">ran short of ammunition,</hi> and retired from action, while the rebels remanned their guns and again commenced the conflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>A portion of the fleet came down the river to <placeName reg="Jamestown Island, James City, Virginia" key="tgn,1007534">Jamestown island</placeName>, near <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The Monitor and <placeName key="tgn,7015683" n="1.000 31" reg="galena, jo daviess, illinois">Galena</placeName> remained in order to keep the rebels awake, the <rs>Monitor</rs> firing regularly once in <measure n="2minutes" type="date">two minutes</measure>, (it is stated above that the ammunition gave out &mdash; liars should have good memories,) fully sustaining the reputation of the <q> &#x0022;cheese-box&#x0022;</q> The <rs type="place">Aristook and Port Royal</rs> were not materially injured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>the action lasted <measure n="4.5hours" type="date">four hours and a half</measure>, constituting <num value="1">one</num> of the most brilliant of the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> About <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a mile further up the river the rebels have made a strong barricade to the further progress of a hostile fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>They have sunk the <rs>Yorktown</rs> and <rs>Jamestown</rs> in the channel, and driven immense piles from <num value="1">one</num> side of the river to the other, forming a stockade similar to that in the entrance to the <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> harbor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> The guns of the battery are said to be manned by the remnants of the crews of the <rs>Merrimac</rs>, <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName> and <placeName reg="Jamestown, Prince Edward, Virginia" key="tgn,2419102">Jamestown</placeName> &mdash; The firing was excellent, showing a great deal of skill. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> The <rs>Naugatuck</rs> escaped serious injury by having her pilot house and deck protected by iron rails laid transversely. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> The body of <persName n="Borrum,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Borrum,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Borrum</surname></persName>, gunner of the <rs>Galena</rs>, has been brought here for interment. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> A gentleman who was at <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName> and <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> yesterday, furnishes the following information: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> The repulse of the gunboats at <placeName key="tgn,2295265" n="1.000 14" reg="drewry's bluff, chesterfield, virginia">Fort Darling</placeName>, <num value="7">seven</num> or <placeName><distance reg="8miles">eight miles</distance> below <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName></placeName> was generally regarded as a <hi rend="italics">very serious affair,</hi> though no full account of it has been made public. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> On board the <rs type="ship">Naugatuck</rs> <num value="18">eighteen</num> men were reported killed by the explosion of her big-gun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The boat was, of course, made useless in the fight and was withdrawn. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> The <rs>Galena</rs> was riddled by the shots from the rebel batteries, having been <q>&#x0022;perorated, &#x0022;</q> as the dispatch said, no less than <num value="18">eighteen</num> times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The loss of life on board was not stated, but it was thought to be heavy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> The Monitor was struck repeatedly, but was said to be uninjured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>She, however, could do nothing offensive, as the batteries are on so high a bluff that it was impossible to give her guns sufficient elevation for the proper range. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> Affairs were quiet at <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> yesterday, but the people still manifest an insolent and sullen disposition, and say that the <orgName n="U. S. Troops" type="org">United States troops</orgName> will soon be driven out of the place. </p> 
<p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/> It is possible that the fears of the county authorities and of the mine owners have magnified this difficulty, but it is evident that the mutineers are numerous, determined, and well armed, and only need the will to make a long and vigorous defence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/> It arises from the tyranny of mining capitalists, as regards both the amount of wages paid to the operatives and the manner in which such wages are doled out. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/> Probably an equal amount of wretchedness is remarked of no other class but the coal miners of this State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>The average amount of wages paid to miners is about <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">five dollars</measure> per week, and this most generally, is not paid in cash, but in <q>&#x0022;orders&#x0022;</q> upon storekeepers in the employment of the mining companies.--The operatives in this way not only receive paltry pay, but they are swindled by the capitalists, and compelled to take merchandize at the capitalists' own rate; so that they barely obtain the necessaries of life. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/> This year was made an era for a <q>&#x0022;strike&#x0022;</q> upon a grand scale, and, taking advantage of the absence of all military organizations from the county, the operatives proceeded to ensure their demands by force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>They seized the collieries of the <rs>Forest Improvement Company</rs>, (now controlled by New York capitalists,) interdicted all employees from working, under threat of death, and, by putting out the fires at the collieries, stopped the pumps that cleared the mines of water, whereby they were soon flooded. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/> The sheriff of <placeName key="tgn,1002876" n="1.000 7" reg="schuylkill, pennsylvania, united states">Schuylkill county</placeName> found that he could make no arrests, and that he could not summon a posse of citizens to assist him, the sympathies of the mass being with the <q> &#x0022;strikers.&#x0022;</q> The latter grew defiant, held meetings at <placeName key="tgn,2111804" n="1.000 1" reg="forestville, shenandoah, virginia">Forestville</placeName>, Hecklsville, <placeName reg="Thomaston, Knox, Maine" key="tgn,7014372">Thomaston</placeName>, and other points, and made preparations to organize a general strike throughout the whole coal region.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>The few that insisted upon working at the old rates were roughly had died, the contractors and agents of the mine owners were threatened with loss of life and property if they maintained opposition, and the sheriff was too weak either in spirit or in force to assert the law and arrest the ringleaders. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/> The latter had organized the strike cunningly and executed it unflinchingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>Colliers of <num value="1">one</num> mine enforced the strike upon an other, so that no employee appeared where he could be recognized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>In this way the officers are yet baffled as to the whereabouts of the ringleaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>About <num value="1500">fifteen hundred</num> men were numbered in the primary offensive measures, and their numbers are increasing.--The locality where hostilities commenced is noted for the turbulence of its denizens, murders and riots being frequent occurrences there, and ignorance and drunkenness being characteristic of the populace. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/> Their high-handed proceedings left the law no option but force, and the <rs>Governor</rs> called upon <persName n="Paterson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00069" reg="mostcommon:Paterson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Paterson</surname></persName> (of <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName> fame) to deputize certain men to quell the riot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>They stealthily moved out towards <placeName key="tgn,2111804" n="1.000 1" reg="forestville, shenandoah, virginia">Forestville</placeName>, the infected district, with loaded muskets and set bayonets, and this morning had mounted guard over all the colliers, to the great astonishment of the mutineers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/> The latter are fleets, and threaten to retake the mines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>I rode among them at dawn to-day, and they seemed unanimous as to their grievances, asserting that they meant to abolish the <q> &#x0022;order&#x0022;</q> system, and to secure equal and definite rates for their services, so that they would be out of the reach of want.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>The sheriff, meantime, has ordered the troops to stand fast, and the reinforcements that went on to-day indicate fears of rupture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>If difficulties occur they will be of a serious character, as the miners are embittered by the presence of soldiers, and they are all armed with their favorite <orgName n="Mountain Rifles" type="rifles">mountain rifles</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>It is on its very face the suggestion of a secret and insidious enemy in our midst, and falling upon minds rendered despondent and distrustful by adversity, has taken root among a few, who, under other circumstances, could never have entertained so unworthy a suspicion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/> We noticed on Friday the case of the negro, who was hung by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> at <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> upon the charge of having murdered <hi rend="italics"><num value="2">two</num></hi> soldiers in a Massachusetts regiment <q> &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">for their money</hi>&#x0022;</q> Is there a man in the <rs>South</rs> who believes that the negro did this thing?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>We have yet to know the instance of a murder being perpetrated by a negro for money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>The negro will kill in a passion or in a fit of jealousy; possibly he might kill in endeavoring to escape upon the commission of burglary to get groceries or whiskey of <rs n="wearing apparel" type="product">wearing apparel</rs> yet we know of no such case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>But that he will deliberately kill a man to rob him of money we do not believe, and we never heard of an instance to show that he will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>As sure as there are murderers and robbers amongst the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, this negro whom they have hung was guiltless of the crime of killing <num value="2">two</num> <placeName reg="Massachusetts" key="tgn,7007517">Massachusetts</placeName> soldiers <q>&#x0022;for their money.&#x0022; </q> We do not believe he killed them at all. The negro is not given to any such desperate act as that of killing <num value="2">two</num> men at once, and at a time, too, when he is in a strange situation, amongst men who have changed his social relation, and while his mind must have been naturally occupied with this new position of his prospects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>The story is incredible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>If the truth is ever known, it will appear that the men, if killed by the negro at all, were killed for other cause than that alleged; but it will be ascertained that he did not kill them at all, and that some other person killed and robbed them. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>If they fight at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, it is well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>If they retire or retreat to some other point, true wisdom will have been their counsellor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/> We conclude, then, by repeating that the fate of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> is not suspended on the fate of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<head>The War news.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/> We may look upon the work which is to terminate in the conquest, or successful defence of the capital of the <rs>South</rs>, as actually commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>The frock of the despot is now near her temple door, and his armed legion are within cannon range of the <rs>Executive</rs> emanation itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>The frequent skirmishes that have taken place, and are continually occurring, are but the faint murmuring of the turbulent storm that is soon to burst upon us.--There is no want of confidence in the result &mdash; The general belief is, that our defence will not only be successful, but glorious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>Our people are hopeful and sanguine; and the <rs>Government</rs>, when it resolved never to surrender the capital without a desperate resistance, did more to elevate itself in public estimation than anything it has accomplished since the commencement of the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/> The reports in reference to the skirmishing that has taken place around the city are, as might be expected, various and conflicting; so much so that no <num value="2">two</num> accounts concur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>Even the exact locality of the fight on Saturday is difficult to determine, to <num value="1">one</num> not familiar with the region of country where it occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>As well as we have been able to learn, the engagement was near the <rs type="place">Meadow Bridge</rs>, over the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>, and between the <rs type="place">Horse Swamp</rs> and the month of <persName n="Brooke,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00248" reg="mostcommon:Brooke,nomatch:0"><surname>Brooke</surname></persName> <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>Our casualties in this skirmish were slight, but we have not been able to obtain a list of them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/> About <time value="9oclock">9 o'clock</time> another brisk engagement was commenced on the <rs type="place">New Bridge Road</rs>, near <placeName reg="Newbridge, Franklin, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2540014">New Bridge</placeName>, some <measure n="9miles" type="distance">nine miles</measure> below the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>Our forces in this fight consisted of <orgName n="Semmee's Brigade"><persName n="Semmee,Brigade,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00249" reg="mostcommon:Semmee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Brigade"></roleName><surname>Semmee</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>, composed of the <num value="6" type="ordinal">6th</num> and <orgName type="regiment" key="LA10">10th Louisiana</orgName>, the <orgName type="regiment" key="GA10">10th Georgia</orgName>, and <orgName type="regiment" key="15VARegiment">15th Virginia regiments</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> named regiment was picketed at or near the bridge, and was attacked by a superior force of the enemy, but held its position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>The fight lasted for several hours, and during its progress about <num value="40">forty</num> were wounded in the <orgName type="regiment" key="LA5">fifth Louisiana</orgName>, among them <persName n="Johnson,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00250" reg="mostcommon:Johnson,S.,P.,,:1"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieuts.</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName> and <persName n="Steinman,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00251" reg="mostcommon:Steinman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant"></roleName><surname>Steinman</surname></persName>, the former in the arm and the latter in the breast. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/> Yesterday, as far as we are informed, matters were quiet along our entire lines, nothing occurring to disturb the quiet which usually precedes the storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>It may be that before this reaches the reader, the salvos of artillery and the rattle of musketry will fall upon the ears of our citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>It is unnecessary for us to caution them to maintain their calmness and composure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>They have for more than a week been looking for active operations, and as a relief from suspense they rather desire than dread an engagement. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/> Late in the afternoon, and after the above was put in type, rapid discharges of artillery were distinctly heard below the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>The cause of the firing, or its result, we have not learned. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/> We have no late advices from <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>The last dispatch from that point announced an anticipated general engagement on <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> last, between the forces of <persName n="Beauregard,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00252" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> and <persName n="Halleck,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00253" reg="mostcommon:Halleck,nomatch:0"><surname>Halleck</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>From the fact that nothing has been received from that quarter, we infer that the expected fight did not occur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>All accounts concur in stating that the decisive struggle must soon commence, and it is highly probable that the fate of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and the great <placeName reg="Mississippi Valley">Mississippi Valley</placeName> will be decided within the same week. </p> </div3>

<head>Another victory in the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/> It was announced yesterday early in the day that a dispatch had been received, giving intelligence of a victory over the enemy by the forces under <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00254" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Ann,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>Upon inquiry at the <name>Departments</name>, we learned that no official information of an engagement had been received, but that it was generally believed that our forces had encountered a body of the enemy at <placeName reg="Front Royal, Warren, Virginia" key="tgn,2111870">Front Royal, in Warren county</placeName>, and had routed them, capturing several pieces of artillery, a large quantity of ordnance stores, and a considerable number of prisoners. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/> From a gentleman who left <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName> yesterday morning we learn that a courier from the <orgName>army of <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00255" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Ann,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName></orgName> arrived at that point on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time>, and brought dispatches to <persName n="Johnson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00256" reg="mostcommon:Johnson,S.,P.,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, substantially confirming the above statement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>Information received from private sources deemed entirely worthy of credit, assure us that <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00257" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Ann,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> was within <placeName><distance reg="4miles">four miles</distance> of <placeName reg="Front Royal, Warren, Virginia" key="tgn,2111870">Front Royal</placeName></placeName> on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>, and the town was occupied by about <num value="1500">1,500</num> Federal troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>We presume that it was this force with which he had the engagement reported, and the hope is reasonably entertained that he had succeeded in bagging the whole party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>There is no probability that <q>&#x0022;old <persName><foreName>Stonewall</foreName></persName>&#x0022;</q> will permit the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> to stagnate during their sojourn in the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>, if he is permitted to continue his operations against them. </p>
