<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>It is an able document; points out, in our opinion, the only possible road to extrication from our difficulties, and forms, upon the whole, a striking contrast to the muddy, mysterious, enigmatical communications we have been accustomed to from that department.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/><persName n="Trenholm,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00199" reg="nearbymention:Trenholm,G.,A.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Trenholm</surname></persName> gives <num value="1">one</num> evidence, and it is a very striking <num value="1">one</num>, that he is a man of business, practically acquainted with the subject he is treating of, and not a mere theorist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>He is the only writer or speaker of the day, so far as we can recollect, who comprehends the enormous folly of <hi rend="italics">tinkering with the currency.</hi>--a folly to which the larger portion of mankind is strangely addicted, and of which no experience, however extended or severe, ever entirely cures the victim.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>We hardly ever met with a man, however ignorant upon general topics, and however willing to confess his ignorance, who did not conceive that, upon this particular <num value="1">one</num>, the hardest of all to master, he had a peculiar <hi rend="italics">gift.</hi> Hence the incomprehensible schemes and projects that have been enacted into laws by our legislative bodies, State and Confederate, from the combined operation of which it is wonderful that our currency has escaped with even the semblance of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>Projectors never seem to understand that our currency is not <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs> &mdash; the least changeable in value of all created things &mdash; though even they, in obedience to a law of nature which ordains that nothing mortal shall be <hi rend="italics">absolutely</hi> stationary, fluctuate to a certain limited extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>We must, he says, &#x0022;anticipate the productions of future years of peace, and convert them into money for immediate use.&#x0022; This is his basis &mdash; his foundation &mdash; strong and practical.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>Then, as a beginning of all things, we must stop the <rs n="printing press" type="product">printing-press</rs>--that is to say, we must issue no more Treasury notes after we have issued all that were called for by the act of last <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>The Government must pledge its faith to this effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>Next, the notes are to be exempt from taxation &mdash; the stupid measure of taxing them having already worked a vast deal of mischief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/><num value="0.2">Twenty per cent.</num> of the tax in kind is then to be applied to the redemption of the notes and the reduction of the outstanding amounts thereof, and this <num value="0.2">twenty per cent.</num> is to be applied annually until all shall have been redeemed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>As to the <hi rend="italics">means</hi> of improving the currency, it will appear from this short outline of <persName n="Trenholm,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00201" reg="nearbymention:Trenholm,G.,A.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Trenholm</surname></persName>'s views that he looks to the resources of the country alone for furnishing them.--And from no other source can they come, and in no other way can they be brought out than by taxation. </p> </div3>
