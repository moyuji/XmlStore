<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>These newspaper extracts were selected and arranged by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> press from <name>English</name> journals sympathizing with the <name>Federalists</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>They would stop the <rs>Alabama</rs> and <rs>Florida</rs>, and would interdict the sailing of other iron-clads supposed to be intended for us, and they claim for the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> the benefit of that agreement entered into by <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, and others, (<num value="1">one</num> article of which is already ignored by <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>,) touching the abolition of privateering, the law of blockade, and the protection of private property at sea, when they know that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> not only did not join in that agreement, but positively refused to do so when invited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/> The last foreign news in Northern papers, however, announces something new with regard to these much bruited (or butted) rams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>They state that the firing resulted from a fight in which we captured some <num value="700">seven hundred</num> of the enemy's cavalry, with their horses and equipments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>The report, coming as it does from <num value="2">two</num> distinct sources, would seem to be entitled to some credit, but if such a capture has been made it is a little singular that no official intelligence of it has reached the city.
