<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/> A gentleman who has recently visited several of the principal cities of the <rs>North</rs> has furnished us with an account of his trip and adjourn among the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>Leaving <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> before <persName n="Christmas,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00303" reg="mostcommon:Christmas,nomatch:0"><surname>Christmas</surname></persName>, he arrived in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> on <dateStruct value="-12-24"><occasion>Christmas eve</occasion></dateStruct>, and was warmly received in that portion of the <rs>State</rs> where he landed, where the <rs>Southern</rs> sentiment is almost unanimous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>Every facility was afforded him in making his way to <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>He arrived in that city in the middle of the day on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, and, being well known there, found it necessary to observe great caution in his movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/>He remained in <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> <num value="1">one</num> week, during which time he kept himself carefully secreted during the day, making his perambulations through the city after night by <rs n="Gas Light" type="newspaper">gas-light</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>White he remained in the city he saw a number of its prominent business men, with whom he conversed freely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>They all seemed hopeful of the result of the present struggle, and believe that Southern independence will be the inevitable consequence of the present revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>There was no public expression of opinion, all parties appearing to be awed by and subdued on account of the presence and unwarrantable acts of the military stationed in their midst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>They express deep mortification at the present humiliated condition of their State, and great regret that the real sentiment of her people is not properly understand and her embarrassments appreciated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>The usual lively aspect of affairs in the city at this season of the year is painfully changed, and sadness and gloom hang over every thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="604"/>Few ladies are to be seen on the street at any time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="605"/> From <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> our traveling friend made his way to the <placeName type="city" key="tgn,7007567">city of New York</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="606"/>Here he remained for more than a week, and during that time circulated freely in all quarters, affording himself an opportunity of hearing expressions of opinion with reference to the present crisis from all classes of the population of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="607"/>None of the restraint felt in <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> is experienced in New York, and those who oppose the <rs>Lincoln Administration</rs> talk with great freedom and act independently, without apparent apprehension of consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>Of the war they declare themselves heartily tired, and with its management completely disgusted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>He heard <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00304" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and his supporters openly denounced as traitors in the public houses in New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>In favor of an honorable adjustment of the present difficulties there is a very strong and rapidly growing sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>Little, if any hope is entertained of finally subjugating the <rs>South</rs> by the thinking portion of the community; but there is still a lingering hope that the <name>States</name> of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> may yet be induced to return to the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>It is everywhere openly and boldly proclaimed that no more troops can be raised for the prosecution of the war under present auspices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>The negro policy of the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> Administration at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> is violently condemned, and the bone and sinew, of whom Northern soldiers are made, swear they will fight neither for nor with the negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="616"/>All the places of amusement in the city were open nightly, and pretty generally thronged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>Business was not active, many of the merchants declaring their determination to retain their goods on the shelf in preference to disposing of them for &#x0022;green backs. &#x0022; Very few &#x0022;green backs&#x0022; are in circulation, the principal currency being <orgName n="State Bank" type="bank">State bank</orgName> money, and postage currency for small change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/>No specie is seen or circulated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/> Leaving New York the gentleman alluded to proceeded to <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, where he arrived in the midst of a heavy snow storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>Being on a sight-seeing expedition he determined, however, not to be deterred by the inclement weather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>Procuring a hack, he visited <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, <placeName reg="Cambridge, Middlesex, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013527">Cambridge</placeName>, and the <rs>Bunker Hill Monument</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>He does not recollect to have heard a word said about the war during his stay in <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, and the people there seem scarcely conscious of the stupendous struggle that is in progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>There seemed to be a general spirit of gayety, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> in that locality apparently feeling little of the pressure resulting from the troubles which are afflicting other and more deserving sections of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>He soon tired of the city, and left it in disgust, returning to New York by the &#x0022;<placeName key="tgn,2017438" n="1.000 13" reg="stonington, new london, connecticut">Stonington</placeName> route,&#x0022; where he remained several days longer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/> From thence he came on to <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, and put up at the <rs type="place">Girard House</rs>, intending to spend several days in that city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>On the night of his arrival <persName n="Wall,Senator,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00309" reg="mostcommon:Wall,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Senator">Senator</roleName> <surname>Wall</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="New Jersey" key="tgn,7007565">New Jersey</placeName>, who was <hi rend="italics">en route</hi> for <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, addressed a large gathering of the people from the front balcony of the <rs type="place">Girard House</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>Our friend says that no idea can be formed from the newspaper reports of the enthusiasm created by this speech.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>From beginning to ending it was received with tumultuous applause by the <name>Philadelphians</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>After the speech was concluded, our traveler, in passing through the hall of the hotel, met with a detective whom he had formerly known in <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, and by whom he was afraid of being recognized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>This unexpected meeting of an old acquaintance &mdash; with whom he had no desire to hold an interview &mdash; determined him to make his sojourn in the <rs n="Quaker" type="religion">Quaker</rs> city very brief, and as the cars were about departing southward, he at once engaged passage. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/> After more than a week of tedious journeying, over a route which we do not deem it entirely prudent to mention, he arrived safely in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> much gratified with his trip, and firmly impressed with the belief, from all that he could see and hear, that the <dateStruct value="-07-1"><day reg="1">first</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> will witness the termination of the war. </p> </div3> </div2>
