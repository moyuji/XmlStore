<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/> We have no right to deal in angry denunciation of <persName n="England,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00236" reg="mostcommon:England,nomatch:0"><surname>England</surname></persName>, or of any other country, because it does not choose to interfere in this war. We entertain for the <rs>British</rs> people only sentiments of respect and admiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>The sympathy manifested by their press and by the better classes of their society with the <rs>Southern</rs> cause, is fully appreciated by every Southern heart, But it is evident that the <rs>British Government</rs>, or, in other words, the <rs n="Whig" type="political">Whig</rs> administration of <persName><foreName>Palmerton</foreName></persName> and <persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00237" reg="mostcommon:Russell,nomatch:0"><surname>Russell</surname></persName> and the <name>Radical</name> wing, whose favor the present Ministry is courting for the purpose of keeping themselves in power, do no reflect the spirit and public opinion of their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>Even of the <rs>British Government</rs> we should have no right to complain any more than of any other Government in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, but for the solemn and undeniable truth that the disunion of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> State is the result of the long, persistent and subtle intrigues of <name>British</name> policy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>We lay no claims to her intervention on account of community of blood, language and religion we arraign her not because she is willing to see her own fresh and blood butchered and annihilated; we have no right to single her out from any other nation of the old world as the object of denunciation except that she alone of them all is responsible for the agitations which have resulted in this war. <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> has ever abstained from interference with <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> institutions; <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, and even <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>, have stood aloof from all offensive meddling with <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> slavery; <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, alone, has sedulously fed the flames of Abolition fanaticism, and by every possible political and social agency has labored by the lever of anti-slavery to overturn the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Government When she had at last accomplished this object, we had a right to expect that she would have been sallefied, and that her animosity would not have demanded the destruction as well as the separation of the <num value="2">two</num> countries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>We had not a right to expect Intervention; we are fully able to establish our independence without her old or that of any other nation, but we had a right, in view of the agency she has exerted in bringing about these troubles to believe that she would have attered some word is the interests of humanity, and shown some inclination to bring about a temporary cessation of bloodshed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>But, instead of this, even the mild measure of an armistice suggested by <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> is rejected by the <rs>Government</rs> which has brought about this division, and which thus manifests a stubborn determination to turn our whole land into a wilderness for the purpose of gratifying her own vengeance and cupidity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>The pretext that a request for an armistice, backed by <num value="3">three</num> such powers as <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="Rossiya" key="tgn,7002435">Russia</placeName>, would have given offence to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, is too ridiculous for comment Great British may great satisfied that she has already given the <name>United Stated</name> of fence in refusing to joint her openly in the crusade against the <rs>South</rs>, and in the sympathy manifested by her press and people for the <rs>South</rs> which the <name>United State</name> will forgive only as long as she is not able to resent it. Should the south be overcome in the present war, of which fortunately for <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> as well as the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, there is no probability, <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> hence would behold a power on this continent which would sweep every vestige of <name>British</name> dominion from the <orgName n="New world" type="newspaper">New World</orgName> and make <name>British</name> supremacy on the ocean a thing of the part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>That is a contingency, however, which <name>British</name> statesmen do not contemplate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>But in the event of Southern independence the has deprived herself, by her inhuman policy, of all claim to peculiar favor from the <rs>Southern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>We had desired her friendship, but she has not permitted us to be her friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>The miserable cotton of her <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName> possessions cannot compete for a moment with that of the <rs>South</rs> when once our ports are opened and peace is restored.--That nation which then has the carrying trade and manufactures of the <rs>South</rs> will become the most powerful and wealthy nation of modern times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>We trust that the <rs>South</rs>, taught by the experience of this war, will henceforth be her own manufacturer, and transport the products of her industry in her own ships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>But, at any rate, neither Old England nor <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> will ever have that monopoly, or, if any nation be permitted to share with us its benefits, it will be the only nation which has manifested <num value="1">one</num> symptom of humanity in the straggle, <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, our ancient ally, that chivalric and enlightened empire, whose skirt are free from all responsibility for our present troubles and whose benevolent dispositions manifested during the present straggle will not be forgotten by the <rs>Southern</rs> people. </p> </div3>
