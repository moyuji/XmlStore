<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> The notes of martial music greet our ears all day long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Soldiers marching and counter marching continually.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Truly, where do all these men come from?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>It must be that the doom of <persName><foreName>Abraham</foreName></persName> is fixed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Company after company, battalion after battalion, march on. To-day have passed <num value="6">six</num> companies of Cavalry and <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> companies of Infantry, making a full regiment of about <num value="900">900</num> or <dateStruct value="1000--"><year reg="1000">1000</year></dateStruct> men.--To-night the <orgName n="Rockbridge Rifles" type="rifles">Rockbridge Rifles</orgName>, <persName n="Letcher,Captain,Samuel,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="default:Letcher,Samuel,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <foreName n="Samuel">Saml.</foreName> <surname>Letcher</surname></persName>, (<persName><foreName>John</foreName></persName>'s brother,)--a large company &mdash; are quartered in the <rs type="place">Court-House</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Other companies are arriving &mdash; all bound for the seat of war. If the <name>East</name> and <name>West</name> are doing like the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>, at least <num value="60000">sixty thousand</num> troops are now under arms in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Our people fall into the ranks of passing companies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Volunteer companies are forming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>There was <num value="2">two</num>, I understand, formed to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Arms must be supplied at once, as there is no lack of men. Many are going without uniforms, so anxious are all for a chance at the scalp of <persName><foreName>Abraham</foreName></persName>, of <placeName reg="Springfield, Greene, Missouri" key="tgn,7014532">Springfield</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> To-day, previous to the departure of <num value="1">one</num> of our cavalry companies, the <rs>Union Cavalry</rs>, by a unanimous vote of the company, struck off &#x0022;U,&#x0022; which stood for <hi rend="italics">Union,</hi> and went with only a &#x0022;C&#x0022; on their caps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>It is now the &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">Se-(C.)-session</hi> Cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Strong disposition exists hereabouts to strike the &#x0022;U.&#x0022; out of the dictionary, as we are not for the <rs>Union</rs>, nor unwilling to fight those who are. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> Troops are taken care of and quartered by our people, and there is much contention among citizens to get enough of the &#x0022;sogers.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> Farmers haul in provisions for them &mdash; some ready cooked &mdash; and make them take it along when they go on. The right spirit prevails among our people.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> <num value="1000">Thousands</num> of reports reach us daily &mdash; some too ridiculous to be believed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Some are well founded, as an occasional messenger comes from the <orgName n="Telegraph Office" type="office">telegraph office</orgName> at <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> To-day the <name>Springhill</name> (<placeName reg="Augusta, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002142">Augusta county</placeName>) Rifles were presented with a beautiful <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> flag by the ladies of <placeName reg="Harrisonburg, Harrisonburg, Virginia" key="tgn,2112170">Harrisonburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The presentation speech was made by <persName n="Strayer,,C.,C.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="default:Strayer,C.,C.,,"><foreName>C.</foreName> <foreName>C.</foreName> <surname>Strayer</surname></persName>, <rs type="role">Esq.</rs>, and the flag was received by <persName n="Doyle,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Doyle,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Doyle</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName>, on behalf of his boys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Both speeches were very fine, and many wet eyes were in the multitude.--As the companies passing have only now and then an occasional flag, the ladies of this place have prepared another for presentation, and it is already upon a handsome staff.--There was also a flag presented to the <rs>Harrisonburg Cavalry</rs> this morning, previous to their departure, by the same fair hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The presentations took place from the portico of the <rs type="place">Exchange Hotel</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> Our <orgName type="mil" key="HomeGuard">Home Guard</orgName> is organizing and enrolling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>It embraces this <orgName n="Magisterial District" type="district">Magisterial district</orgName>, which will be divided into smaller districts, each district under a Captain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The whole force will be about <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="500">five hundred</num> men. These men are armed with their own home rifles, to which they have been used since childhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>A committee of <num value="17">seventeen</num> men has been appointed to procure eatables for the families of those soldiers who are gone, and they are directed to call at each house and see if anything is wanted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>A depot for the stowing of provisions is secured, and all articles are taken there, and from there distributed, under the supervision of an agent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>So you see none of the soldiers' families will suffer or want for anything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>In the meantime, large crops are in the ground, and the &#x0022;chance is good&#x0022; for a supply of all the necessaries of life, notwithstanding the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> Excitement has been pretty high all day, yet all seem to appreciate that war is upon us, and will meet the issue like men. Numbers are preparing to follow the companies that are already gone from here, and the tide will continue to flow on. All are determined, and no blanched cheeks give expression to the horrors of war, but rush on to defend the right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> This morning, at an early hour, <num value="3">three</num> men, who had been confined in our county jail for sometime, escaped, by sawing off the bars of their cell window.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Their crimes were burglary and theft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Early this morning, handbills were printed and runners started to circulate them in all directions, as we have no <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> mails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/><persName n="Logan,,J.,T.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="default:Logan,J.,T.,,"><foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <surname>Logan</surname></persName>, Deputy <rs type="role2">Sheriff</rs>, is out with men to search for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>They will, doubtless, be arrested, as they did not probably get out much before daylight, or the <rs n="night watch" type="product">Night-Watch</rs> would have captured them &mdash; the <rs n="night watch" type="product">Night-Watch</rs> having been discharged about <time value="3.5oclock">3&#x00BD; o'clock</time>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/> I understand that the farmers along the road, through the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>, have hauled large quantities of corn for the horses of the companies, passing free of charge, and offer it freely and willingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Also, provisions are hauled out to the men. <persName n="Lincoln,,Abe,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="default:Lincoln,Abe,,,"><foreName>Abe</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> can never whip such a people; for there is too much of the right spirit in them to become slaves or mercenaries to tyranny. </p>

<head>In the coal-pit cabin.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/> As a rule, we do not find colliers so well informed as factory operatives; but, on the other hand they are a quieter and more tractable set. They hardly seem to know fear; but still, the darkness in which they labor, and the many dangers surrounding them in their cavernous abode, appear to imperceptibly affect their <orgName n="General Character" type="misc">general character</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>Though, from better application of mechanical power, and a more scientific regulation of the currents of air in our larger coal-mines, accidents have become less numerous, they will, from the nature of the work, always be rather frequent; and the collier, on descending the shaft to his daily task, if reflective, must be keenly alive to impending danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>In walking through the coal district about the time the men leave off work, it is amusing to watch the different bands of men emerging from the pit's mouth, having been quickly wound up by the powerful machinery from the regions of darkness into the welcome light of day. Many of them are as wild and frolicsome as a pack of boys let out from school; and as soon as they can free themselves from the chains, in which they have been hanging like a large bunch of smutty grapes &mdash; the youngsters in the middle for greater safety &mdash; they run capering and shouting from the bank, making the most of their liberty, and dispelling, by their boisterous mirth, any false notions of pity we may have been entertaining for their hard lot. In winter certainly, during their working days, they never see the sun, for those of them who labor the whole of the day, commence before it is light, and do not leave off until it is dark, being underground nearly from <time value="6am">6 A. M.</time> to <time value="6pm">6 P. M.</time> The <rs>Monday</rs> following the reckoning <rs>Saturday</rs> is mostly a play-day with these men; and, if wages are good, not unfrequently the <name>Tuesday</name> also, though on these occasions they will frequently assemble at the pit at the customary time, and then, from some trivial excuse &mdash; easily found by men unwilling to work &mdash; or at the direct instigation of <num value="1">one</num> of the youngest hands, they will return home again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>It takes but little, on ordinary occasions, to make a whole pit's company &#x0022;play&#x0022; Should the engine man be but a few minutes behind time in the morning, and cause a slight delay, when they are ready to go down the shaft, they will often refuse to work; and should any unforeseen occurrence prevent the whole day's work being done, they can seldom or never be persuaded to begin later in the day, and do <num value="3">three</num>-quarters or half a day's work instead. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/> Though individually the colliers do not care much for a few wounds and bruises, priding themselves upon their hardy endurance of suffering, yet, if <num value="1">one</num> of their company is slightly hurt in any way, so as to be compelled to leave his post, they will in general all desist from working, regardless of the consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>We cannot give them, as a class, great credit for being provident; but there are many exceptions, and in visiting their homes, we find that where there is a shelf for a few books, a little store is also laid by, in the proverbid <hi rend="italics">stocking foot</hi> or in the <orgName n="Savings Bank" type="bank">savings bank</orgName>, against &#x0022;the rainy day.&#x0022; At present, literary societies and mechanics' institutes have signally failed in reaching the <hi rend="italics">bulk</hi> of these men, though free lectures, in populous places, and other means of social entertainment, appear to be attended with good effects. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/> For religious instruction, a great portion of them are indebted to the <rs>Wesleyan</rs> connection, and &mdash; is coming nearer still down to their level &mdash; to the <name>Primitive</name> <rs n="Methodist" type="religion">Methodists</rs>, or &#x0027;Ranters,&#x0027; as they are vulgarly called.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>In the prayer-meanings of these dissenters, there is a degree of energy and enthusiasm exhibited which in most cases accords better with the colliers' taste than the more formal church service.--Another inducement is, that many of their own number take the lead at these religious meetings, and, with exemplary zeal and striking enthusiasm, strive, as far as their ability permits, to inculcate the doctrines of Christianity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>There are many who will listen to the exhortation of a &#x0022;butty collier,&#x0022; whom nothing would persuade to attend the ministration of a duly ordained clergyman. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>In traveling about the neighborhood of the pits, I frequently have opportunities of talking to the colliers about their work, or other topics, and have found occasionally, under a swarthy cloak of flannel and dirt, a degree of intelligence that much surprised me. On a cold or rainy day, I have sometimes entered <num value="1">one</num> of their calls by the pits, sure of finding shelter and a good fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>If you have never been in <num value="1">one</num> of these places, you may enter with me this evening, and see and hear what is going on. A capacious fire-place, on which a barrowful or <num value="2">two</num> of coal would be lost, occupies nearly the whole of <num value="1">one</num> side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>There is no neat cast-iron grate, but some long bars, or old pit rails, are stretched across a wide cavity in the wall, forming an ample receptacle for the fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>Rods of iron, or sometimes strong ropelines, are stretched across the cabin in front of the fire place, for the men to dry their wet clothes upon, when they have been working in places troubled with water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>Various interstices are seen round the unplastered walls handy for putting dinner basins and cans in, or for slowing away other odds and ends; and in <num value="1">one</num> of the corners furthest from the fire, a rude cupboard is generally found, where powder, safety-lamps, luse and cartridge bags for blasting rocks, candles and other stores, can be put under lock and key Round the walls are fixed some short butts of trees, across which are placed rough slabs for the men to sit upon, by whom a large bottle of ale is often discussed, when for some extra work they have had what they call a &#x0022;fetching&#x0022; from the nearest public house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>Without running into any excess, there is a sort of untrammelled enjoyment about these free-and-easy sittings in the cabin that many of the pitmen have a strong relish for. The &#x0022;fetching&#x0022; does not always consist only of beer; solids, such as bread and cheese, and ham are often added; and many a royal banquet has passed off with loss stealing enjoyment than is realized by these jolly colliers around their huge fire, after some heavy task is done. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/> Sitting thus, some of them with eyes half closed, drawing at a short black pipe, they recount to each other scenes of danger they have passed through, difficulties they have encountered, extraordinary seams of coal they have helped to get, and other wonderful experiences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> that speaks to-night is an old man, upwards of <num value="60">sixty</num>, short and stiff, of the true collier build.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>His legs are bowed a little, but firm under him yet; and you can see that the bridge of his <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> nose has been broken, for a dark-blue line stretches across it, shewing where a lump of coal or other black substance has fallen upon it.--You will frequently see colliers with many of these blue seams upon their face, and other uncovered parts of their body, for wherever <unclear>oucu</unclear> deep into the flesh it brands a man for ever. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/> <q>&#x0022;It was better than <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> ago,&#x0022;</q> he began, &#x0022;in &#x0027;Bony's&#x0027; time, when I was a lad &#x0027;drawing dans,&#x0027; and doing work such as you youngsters know nothing about now-a-days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>There had been a bad harvest, I remember, and the wheat was so had that the bread made of it would hardly hold together, it was so wet and soft; and my old woman often scooped the middle of the loaf out with a spoor, and put it in cans for the children to <unclear></unclear> with treacle, like pudding, I have seen <unclear></unclear> tempered chaps throw a lump of their <unclear></unclear> against the wall, where it would stick like mortar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>Potatoes went up to a great price, and were hardly ever seen in our pit; and often there has been a scrambling fight to get a taste, if the young men saw a few in somebody's dinner-basin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>Well, there was a lot of us driving a &#x0027;head&#x0027; through some faulty ground, with a bad roof, and I was drawing out in dans what little coal they met with while pushing through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>I had to go about <measure n="40yards" type="distance">forty yards</measure> through the uneven way they were making, back into another road, where a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> lad met me with an empty dan-basket to go back with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>At middle-day, this lad brought our dinners, and I took them to the end of the head, but we had barely sat down to eat them, when we heard a loud rumbling noise near at hand. &#x0027;Now we are in for it,&#x0027; said <num value="1">one</num> of the men; &#x0027;the head we have been driving has fallen in, and we are shut up.&#x0027; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/> &#x0022;Creeping warily along, they found it even as he had said; for about half the length of the way, the roof had fallen in, completely blocking up the passage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>The hardest collier looked spite, which, with the dirt, I remember, give some of them a strange, leaden look, us though they were numbed with cold and fright.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>We did not feel any more appetite for the <unclear></unclear> now, so it was carefully laid by; for, as <num value="1">one</num> of them said, &#x0027;We shall want it bad enough by and by. The men did not spend much time in useless grief; but putting </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/> out all our candles except <num value="1">one</num>, for we had not more than half-a-dozen in all, they began resolutely to work to clear out the road again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>It went on slow and toilsome, for having no <unclear></unclear> to prop it up, the roof was continually giving way, now that it was once broken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>Candle after candle burned away, and though the sweat ran off them, they could not make much progress in clearing the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>When half the candles were gone, they had not gained above a couple of yards in length: still they kept manfully at it, being all thoroughly aroused to the impending danger of being left with little air and no light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>We could now hear men working at the other end of the head and knocking, as colliers do when they wish to signal to <num value="1">one</num> another, being too far away to be heard by shouting, and this revived our courage very much; for though we could tell that the head had fallen in for a considerable length, we knew every effort would be made to get at us. I carried the last candle to them and had to wipe it carefully before giving it them, for, almost unknowingly, tears had been dropping on it as I hurried along.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>I told the man I gave it to, that it was the only <num value="1">one</num> left; he said nothing, but sticking it in a bit of clay against a large rock, worked on in silence with more vigor than before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>I dragged away with all my strength at the rocks they got out, to clear their way a little, stealing now and then a furtive glance at the small candle fast melting away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>When it was almost burned down, <num value="1">one</num> of them proposed that we had better see after our dinners, and put them where we could conveniently find them in the dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>We did so, and then tried to cut up <num value="1">one</num> of the hack helves into splinters, to give light a little longer; but it was old and tough, and would not, after all, give any light to work by. Bits of tobacco paper and other scraps made a spill or <num value="2">two</num>, to eke out a flame for a few minutes, and then we were left in total darkness. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/> <q>&#x0022;Judging by the time the candles would last, we had now been blocked up for <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="8hours" type="date">eight hours</measure>, and I, for <num value="1">one</num>, began to want something to eat badly, though ashamed to say so to the rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>Now we were in the dark, however, the oldest man proposed we should sit down and eat a small portion of our dinners, and think over what we could do for the best.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/>Oh, how good the soft bread was now ! I wondered how I could ever have disliked it before, and could hardly deny myself from eating it all. But as I heard the men whispering to each other, that it may be a day and a night before we could be got out, I laid a portion by for another little meal, nor did I quite empty my can of beer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>Trying to work again in the dark, <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="3">three</num> men got hurt in the back by a rock falling upon him, so that we were compelled to give over, lest some of us should get killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>We knocked occasionally, for them to hear and answer us, but the sounds did not seem to come much nearer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>How slow the time passed away.--Our little store of food, though we divided it into small portions, was soon gone, and now thirst began to be felt more than hunger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>After we had been shut up about <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure>, as near as we could tell, the air began to feel very close and oppressive, and it made the men feel so weak that they could not have worked even if we had had candles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/><num value="1">One</num> of the colliers had been used to attend prayer-meetings, and getting us all to kneel down together, he prayed earnestly, and encouraged us all to do the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/>I cannot remember much longer myself, for they told me I had been insensible for some time before the road was open; but at length the way was cleared, and we were carried out all but lifeless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>It had taken more than <measure n="48hours" type="date">forty-eight hours</measure> to get to us, for the rock fell in so continually that timber had to be set all along to support the roof over the narrow way.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/> When the grey-headed old collier had finished, he refilled his pipe, and wanted to know if <q>&#x0022;nobody else had got nothing to say.&#x0022;</q> There was a lusty little fellow in <num value="1">one</num> corner whom they called &#x0022;<persName><foreName>Jerry</foreName></persName>,&#x0022; who gave us an account of how <num value="1">one</num> day he was pulled up the pit without his leave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/>It appears he was what they call a &#x0022;hooker-on,&#x0022; or <num value="1">one</num> that connected the carriages of the coal with the pit-chain, when ready for being wound up the shaft, and unhooked those which came down empty; and, if the pit's company were all at work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>was continually kept close to the bottom of the shaft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>It appears that <num value="1">one</num> day as he was connecting a carriage of coal to the main chain, the engine started rather sooner than he expected; and just as he was slipping the hook into the large link, his thumb got fastered, by the snatch of the engine, between the <num value="2">two</num>, and before he was well aware of it, he found himself a good many yards up the shaft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>They pause slightly a short distance up the shaft, to steady the weight; but he said he was unable to shout, and consequently was pulled up in that manner to the top of the shaft, his hand and arm completely numbed by pain and tension. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/> Practical jokes occur, it seems, even in coal mines; and <num value="1">one</num> that had nearly proved fatal to the parties engaged was now related.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/>In some pits, otherwise well ventilated, small quantities of carbureted hydrogen gas collect in nooks and crevices of the roof, especially in corners partly out of the current of air which runs through the various workings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>To frighten a novice, a reckless fellow will put a naked candle up into <num value="1">one</num> of these places, causing a miniature explosion of fire-damp, just sufficient to terrify any inexperienced person, but what an old hand would consider a mere bagatelle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>It appears a stranger had been down <num value="1">one</num> of the pits, who seemed very forward with his remarks, and altogether skeptical as to danger; indeed, the man said <q>&#x0022;he gave himself important airs, and knew all about everything a great deal better than us poor colliers.&#x0022;</q> So when they had come to a part of the pit by an old road, that had been used for some time, a sly rogue among them directed this savant's attention to some tarry matter oozing out from the coal in the roof, close to the air door leading into the old road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>Adjusting his spectacles, the opinionated wiseacre put up his candle to the place to note well the phenomenon, saying, at the same time, that it was nothing new to <hi rend="italics">him;</hi> but he had scarcely uttered this self-conceited remark when the gas caught fire from his candle, which he had been poking all about, and a scorching flame passed over and almost blinded them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>They instantly fell down flat, as is usually the safest plan in cases of fire, and he, imitating their example, did the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>It was well they did so; for almost in an instant a loud explosion fairly shook the ground, blowing the air door, close to them, into fragments over their heads &mdash; The flame, they said, must have passed through a crevice close to the door, and ignited a large quantity of inflammable gas in the old disused road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>Fortunately, they escaped without any very serious injury, though the learned theorist's practical experience was of a painful character &mdash; such as he would not wish repeated; for his eyebrows and whiskers were singed off, and his clothes bore sure testimony that <q>&#x0022;the smell of the fire had passed over them.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/> The introduction of flat chains into the collieries, though combatted against by the men at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, as most new things are, has been the means of saving much loss of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>It was not a very uncommon thing, before, to hear of a hempen rope breaking, and dropping a whole band-full of men. Such an accident seldom or never occurs where good <num value="3">three</num>-link chains are used, for as <num value="1">one</num> of the chains is able to bear more than is generally trusted to all <num value="3">three</num>, and as they are all joined fast together at every alternate link by a wooden &#x0022;key,&#x0022; driven tightly in, and held there by stout little nails called stubbs, it is possible that all <num value="3">three</num> chains may be broken in separate places, and the weight still be sustained, by the intervention of many keys between broken parts An old charter-master &mdash; who contracts for raising the coal at so much per ton &mdash; told us how terribly frightened he had been once by <num value="2">two</num> links breaking together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/>He was coming up the pit on the top of a loaded coal &#x0022;skip,&#x0022; or basket, and when near the top he heard something snap, and looking up, saw that <num value="1">one</num> of the links had broken, and of the <num value="2">two</num> remaining links <num value="1">one</num> appeared rather slack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>By and by, he could plainly see that the <num value="1">one</num> link which appeared to bear all the weight, was parting in <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/>It was an old engine, which wound but slowly, and the short time taken in being pulled up the last few yards seemed, he said, like an age. As the link parted and stretched a little, of course the other chain tightened up, and had come to its bearing before actual severance had taken place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>It was impossible, he said, to describe the intensity of his feelings for the few remaining seconds as his eyes glared at the single whole link left, on which his life depended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/>He wasn't a praying man then, he said, but his heart offered up an earnest ejaculatory petition, almost without his knowing it, and his companions stared with astonishment as he fell on his knees upon the &#x0022;tacking,&#x0022; or platform covering the top of the pit, and returned hearty thanks for his safe deliverance as soon as he was safely landed and out of peril. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="735"/> Colliers are rather inclined to be superstitions, perhaps owing to their work being so frequently done in the dark, or with such a light as only makes darkness visible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>They are generally too willing to believe in a special <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> averting danger and death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>Where there are so many accidents, instances of what appear to be miraculous escapes are not uncommon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>Several cases have occurred of persons falling down shafts some <num value="40">forty</num> or <measure n="50yards" type="distance">fifty yards</measure> deep, and sustaining no serious injury; and though science may assert that the parachutical inflation of the man's stiff flannel shirt, or the woman's voluminous skirts, broke their fall, the collier finds it easier and pleasanter to believe that <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> interfered in a direct manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>It is an old assertion of the pitmen, that the roads fall in more when all is quiet, at night, than during the daytime, when men and horses are continually employed in them; and they often have to clear away in the morning large masses of rock which could not have fallen during working hours without causing loss of life. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/> The sexagenarian here recounted some of the narrow escapes he had undergone, of which I can only remember <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>He had finished earlier than usual <num value="1">one</num> day, and was coming up the shaft in company with another man clandestinely, as employers object to <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> coming up by themselves, and expect them to wait until the customary number (<num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="9">nine</num>) are all ready together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>He was not sure whether they shouted to the banks man or not when near the top, for him to signal to the engine man that men were </p> <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/> coming up; but, either accidentally or otherwise, he pulled them about a yard too high and they came in contact with the pulley, just as the tacking was being pulled over the pit. His companion fell out, and dropped on the very edge of the tacking overhanging the pit, escaping wonderfully with only a few bruises, while he himself clung to the rim of the pulley, against which he was pulled, and was gently lowered again unhurt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/> Another time he was ascending the pit with <num value="8">eight</num> or <num value="9">nine</num> more colliers after their usual day's work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>They were singing away on coming towards the pit-mouth, as they often do; the engine man pulled them up exactly to the right place; the banks man leisurely pushed the tacking over the pit, when instantly the large hook they were hanging by snapped in <num value="2">two</num>, and dropped them all on to the tacking, just ready to receive them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>Had the hook broken a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> or so before, they would all have been precipitated to the bottom of the shaft, some <measure n="600feet" type="distance">six hundred feet</measure>, and consequently have been dashed to pieces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/>The old man said, that he frequently thought of that time when death was so near; and often when he and his family had been but badly off, when wages were low and work scarce, he gratefully trusted that the same watchful <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> would help them through their difficulties. </p>
