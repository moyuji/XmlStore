<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>His illness has been long and tedious, the complaint being typhoid pneumonia.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>His loss, at this particular time especially, may be regarded as a public calamity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>He was a member of the old and well-known <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> family of <persName n="Daniel,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="nearbymention:Daniel,John,M.,,"><surname>Daniel</surname></persName> who have been residents of <placeName key="tgn,1002913" n="1.000 16" reg="stafford, virginia">Stafford county</placeName> for probably the last <measure n="150years" type="date">hundred and fifty years</measure>, and who have been noted for talent for several generations past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>He came to this city from <persName n="Stafford,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Stafford,nomatch:0"><surname>Stafford</surname></persName> when very young, probably not more than <measure n="18years" type="date">eighteen years</measure> of age. He <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> became known as a contributor to the <hi rend="italics">Southern Planter,</hi> an agricultural paper, owned by <persName n="Bernard,Mister,Peter,D.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="default:Bernard,Peter,D.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>Peter</foreName> <foreName>D.</foreName> <surname>Bernard</surname></persName>.--His articles, though upon subjects upon which, it was to be presumed, he had spent very little thought, were written with so much vigor and purity of style that they attracted instant attention, and a general call was made for the name of the author.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>He was at the time, and for several years, Librarian of the <orgName n="Richmond Library" type="library">Richmond Library</orgName>, where he devoted his time to severe study, became a good classical scholar, and laid the foundation of that general and extensive knowledge which is <num value="1">one</num> of the characteristics of his writings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>When scarcely of age, about the year <dateStruct value="1847--"><year reg="1847">1847</year></dateStruct>, he became joint editor with the late <persName n="DeWitt,,Bennett,M.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="default:DeWitt,Bennett,M.,,"><foreName>Bennett</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>DeWitt</surname></persName>, of the <hi rend="italics">Examiner,</hi> which was established by the latter about that time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>That paper immediately became conspicuous by the extraordinary ability with which it was edited, not less than by the boldness of its views and the freedom which it exercised in criticising the opinions of all classes of politicians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>It was not long before <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Daniel,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="nearbymention:Daniel,John,M.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Daniel</surname></persName>'s</hi> name was known not only to the whole <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">State of Virginia</placeName>, but to the entire press of the country, as <num value="1">one</num> of the ablest among the writers of the day.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> In <dateStruct value="1853--"><year reg="1853">1853</year></dateStruct>, being then in the zenith of his reputation, although not yet <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> old, <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Daniel,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="nearbymention:Daniel,John,M.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Daniel</surname></persName></hi> was appointed Charge to the <rs type="place">Court of Sardinia</rs>, through the influence, it was thought, of the late <persName n="Floyd,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Floyd,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Floyd</surname></persName>, between whom and <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Daniel,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="nearbymention:Daniel,John,M.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Daniel</surname></persName></hi> a warm attachment, personal and political, continued to exist until the death of the former.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>He continued to reside at the <orgName n="Turin Court" type="court">Court of Turin</orgName> for <measure n="8years" type="date">eight years</measure>, when he was recalled by the growing troubles of the country.--Upon his return, in <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct>, he regained command of the <hi rend="italics">Examiner,</hi> and continued to conduct it with consummate ability until the day of his death. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>It was full, flowing full, of fire and eloquence, often highly rhetorical, always vigorous and well sustained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>No man ever possessed, in a superior degree, the faculty of fierce and overwhelming denunciation, or the power of turning into ridicule such persons or things as it suited his pleasure to treat in that manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>At the same time, it possessed <num value="1">one</num> quality which is always the mark of genius, and which mere talent can never attain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>He made everything interesting that he wrote about, a faculty which <persName n="Johnson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Johnson,H.,V.,,:1"><surname>Johnson</surname></persName> attributes to <persName n="Goldsmith,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Goldsmith,nomatch:0"><surname>Goldsmith</surname></persName> in those famous words, &#x0022;<foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">nihil tetigit quod non ornavit.</hi></foreign>&#x0022; </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> The object of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> in waging the kind of war they are now engaged in carrying on against us, could not be mistaken, even though the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName> had not taken pains to reveal it in the extract republished by us yesterday morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>It is no longer a restoration of the <rs>Union</rs> that they seek.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>That was from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> a mere pretence, used to cover designs which, at <num value="1">one</num> time, it might not have been quite so prudent to expose as they believe it to be now.--The universal belief among them is, that they are on the point of completing our subjugation, and that it is, therefore, no longer required by prudence to make a mystery of the fate they design for us. That fate is simply the utmost degree of degradation to which their ingenuity, prompted by their malice, can devise.--They will not be content with merely beating us into a surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>We must suffer all the horrors of conquest ever heretofore put in practice against a defeated foe, with the addition of new ones, devised for the especial gratification of their hatred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>That hatred is a passion universal among the whole <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>There are so few bosoms not agitated by it that they scarcely serve for an exception to the general rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>It began long before this war, and any <num value="1">one</num> who attributes the unheard-of enormities which have marked its progress to the disposition on the part of all armies to commit excesses will be very much mistaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>It arises from the long, deep rooted hatred to which we have alluded, and which is now presented with an opportunity of gratifying itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Our cities are wantonly burnt, and our population insulted and murdered, upon <hi rend="italics">principle.</hi> It is the result of cold-blooded calculation, not of military passions, stimulated by resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>These soldiers are turned loose upon a population whom they hate, and they are told to do their worst, for they will rather be applauded than punished for any crime they may perpetrate. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> Such being the treatment our people receive while we have large armies still in the field, what are we to expect when resistance shall have ceased altogether?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> themselves tell us a part of what we are to look for, but they do not tell us all. We must look for it in their acts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>In <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, they have not only set the negroes free, but, as far as they have been able, have compelled the whites to associate with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>They do this because they know that the whites consider such association as degrading to them; and they are determined to make them drink the cup to the dregs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>There are probably among us Southern people who are tired of the war, and who hope that, by submission, they may obtain a little mercy at the hands of their masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Never were people more woefully deceived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> will have no mercy upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>He is only for bearing when he finds his proposed victim in a condition and disposition to resist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Let him but once be at his mercy &mdash; completely in his power &mdash; incapable of farther resistance &mdash; and he might as well hope for mercy from a tiger, or compassion from a wolf, or forbearance from any other cruel and cowardly wild beast of the forest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> will not only strip his victim of everything he has in the world, down to the very clothes upon his back, but he will take every other means to make him feel his situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>Is it not better to continue to resist even unto death than to accept such a peace as this? </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> There is a material tendency in the human mind to superstition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>There is a positive luxury in gratifying that kind of taste, which even the unbelieving Northern brain has not been able to overcome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Its faith in spiritualism, as it is called, was something wonderful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>We have never been able till lately to see any ground for the marvellous influence of those tappings and trappings which, in the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> States, have so often caused the unseen world to disclose its secrets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>But of late our incredulity has received a staggering blow.--We once laughed when we were told of handkerchiefs spontaneously tying themselves into knots, and <rs n="hair brushes" type="product">hair brushes</rs> rushing, of their own accord, to people's heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>It seemed a direct insult to the understanding, and even the illuminate admitted as much, but had recourse to <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> spirits to explain the marvel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>We might have remained skeptical till our dying day, but certain phenomena have been exhibited of late in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> which convince us that there are things in heaven and earth not dreamt of in our philosophy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> We may as well premise a precise statement of the facts which have wrought this change of sentiment by reference to the impossibility which has, till lately, existed of providing an adequate supply of provisions for the army and the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>There has been great privation here &mdash; we need not deny it,--and even the noble <orgName>army of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Lee,R.,E.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName></orgName>--that army which has so long stood as a wall of fire between our homes and the enemy &mdash; was in danger of suffering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>In these straits, earnest appeals were made, from time to time, for gifts of provisions to support the army and to keep the poor from starvation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>A good many farmers in the interior responded nobly to these calls, and a good many more were equally ready to respond, but had barely sufficient to support their own families.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>No <num value="1">one</num> could doubt the correctness of the assertion, for, in some cases, when they were asked to sell, they declared that they had nothing; and even Confederate money could not create provisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The poor would have to starve and the soldiers to suffer.--Their hearts ached to think of it; but they had nothing, and must look in helpless anguish upon the dismal scene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Well, thus much premised, we come to the supernatural part of the subject. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> A party of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> spiritualists, under the direction of that famous wizard, <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,nomatch:0"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName>, left the mountains of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> a few weeks ago, and, in the course of their travels, exhibited a series of wonders never surpassed in the days of witchcraft.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>They made a few raps with their electrical knuckles at the farm-houses they visited, where previously there was nothing that could, by possibility, be given away or sold, and potatoes, bags of meal, barrels of flour, and endless hams of bacon, came to the light of day. This was no mere illusion of the senses, but a solid and savory reality, which would have gladdened the souls of many a hungry citizen of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and many a worn out soldier in the trenches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>There was no motive for any such deception, and it is repugnant to the patriotism of those who were subject to these manipulations; who were, no doubt, as much astonished as anybody at the apparition of objects whose existence they were in profound ignorance of till the tappings and rappings of <persName n="Sheridan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Sheridan,nomatch:0"><surname>Sheridan</surname></persName>'s spiritualists compelled their manifestation. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/> We can only regret that our own commissaries and other agents for obtaining provisions do not possess this supernatural power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>It is possible for a man to be the greatest scamp in the world, and yet to be on most excellent terms with himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>This is especially the case when fanaticism comes in to the aid of self- esteem, and gives him a dispensation for any little indulgences of the carnal man that, in other people, he would consider unpardonable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>They will argue that the rules of civilization, not alone Christianity, do not permit any barbarities in warfare not essential to the end for which war is waged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>And yet, the community which holds these excellent principles is not aware of any inconsistency between their faith and practice when they exult in the deadly hate that they bear the <rs>South</rs> as if it were a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class virtue; when they pant for our extermination; when they rejoice to read accounts in their daily papers of the <rs>Southern</rs> farm-houses and towns that have been burned to the ground; of the defenceless women and children that have been turned out of doors, and exposed to destruction, and sometimes worse; of the prospect of starving to death whole communities of innocent people; of prisoners dying miserably of cruel treatment, or cold, or famine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Nay, their very preachers get up in the pulpit, and, Sunday after <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, invoke their hearers to rain fire and brimstone upon the accursed rebels, and to spare none of the infernal crew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>All this time they call themselves Christians, and think they are so, and have no doubt of their being as righteous in the estimation of their final <rs type="role2">Judge</rs> as they are in their own. The Scriptures somewhere speak of a &#x0022;strong delusion&#x0022; being sent upon some wicked men, that they may believe a lie. But the victim of a delusion never believes that he is the man.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/> The evening papers of this city were, yesterday, all ablaze with accounts of the tremendous battle, and the <rs>Petersburg</rs> papers of yesterday morning, that reached here during the evening, contain the following thrilling account: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/> &#x0022;Last night, at <time value="10:9oclock">nine minutes past 10 o'clock</time>, the enemy opened on our extreme left, near the <rs>Appomattox</rs>, with a fearful artillery fire, while a simultaneous movement was made on the part of their infantry, the men charging up to our breastworks in great masses. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/> &#x0022;Our men, under the gallant <rs>Gordon</rs>, were wide awake, and received the charge with a coolness and precision which caused the assailants to recoil with evident dismay and consternation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/> &#x0022;Up to <time value="12oclock">12 o'clock</time> the fighting was continued with great vigor and persistency, the enemy making, in all, <num value="5">five</num> separate assaults, in every <num value="1">one</num> of which the blue-bellies were sent reeling back. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/> &#x0022;At the late hour at which we write (<time value="12:30am">12 1-2 A. M.</time>) heavy firing is progressing; but our officers and men know that the enemy has done his worst, and feel perfectly satisfied that they can hold their own against <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00201" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s combined legions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/> &#x0022;The night was intensely dark, it being impossible to see a man at a distance of more than <num value="20">twenty</num> paces, and we cannot speak positively of the enemy's losses, but they must have been immense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>They came in swarms, supposed to be several lines of battle deep, and as in no instance did they even get through our obstructions, the irresistible inference is, that the slaughter was fearful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>Our loss, we are pleased to hear, was comparatively small. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/> &#x0022;We witnessed the scene from the brow of <placeName reg="Bolling's hill">Bolling's hill</placeName>, and never saw <num value="1">one</num> more fearfully grand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>From the river around to the <rs type="place">Wilcox house</rs>, for a distance of <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure>, the horizon was illuminated with bursting mortars and exploding shells, while the line of battle was most clearly defined by the sheet of flame which literally blazed, without cessation from the muzzles of our small arms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/> &#x0022;The entire community was aroused by the deafening roar of artillery and incessant roll of musketry, which shook every dwelling from roof to basement and caused the inmates to shake with agitation and alarm. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/> The enemy evidently expected to surprise our troops; but <persName n="Gordon,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00202" reg="mostcommon:Gordon,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Gordon</surname></persName>'s boys never sleep when danger is near, and extended to the assailants a reception which we think it probable they will never forget.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/><persName n="Gordon,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00203" reg="mostcommon:Gordon,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Gordon</surname></persName>'s motto is: &#x0027;Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty. &#x0027; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/> &#x0022;The gallantry of our men was displayed in a most gratifying manner, and their conduct is the theme of universal praise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>The artillery fire on our side was magnificent, and the <rs type="place">Cummings</rs> and <placeName reg="Bradford battery">Bradford batteries</placeName> in <placeName reg="Chesterfield, Chesterfield, Virginia" key="tgn,2111165">Chesterfield</placeName> were eminently conspicuous for rapid and accurate firing from the elevation we occupied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>It is a fact especially deserving of mention, that during the entire fight, which lasted <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>, not a man was observed coming to the rear. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/> &#x0022;We have just seen an officer from the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>He says the enemy charged up to our <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">chevaux de frise,</hi></foreign> within <num value="10">ten</num> paces of the muzzles of our guns, and were literally mowed down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>The slaughter is known to have been very great; but morning will alone reveal its extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>Our loss is unprecedentedly small.&#x0022; </p> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/> Last evening, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time, we were enabled to obtain authentic intelligence from <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> touching the affair on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time>. The whole <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> thing can be disposed of in a few words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>The enemy discovering, or imagining that they discovered, some movements among our pickets in <persName n="Gordon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00204" reg="mostcommon:Gordon,nomatch:0"><surname>Gordon</surname></persName>'s front that looked like a preparation for a renewal of the attack of last <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, opened upon our lines with all their batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>Our troops, believing this cannonade designed to cover an assault by the enemy, also opened with all our batteries, and each side blazed away, fast and furious, for hours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>The expenditure of ammunition was immense and the noise stunning, but we have not learned that any casualties resulted on either side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>It is not surprising that the citizens of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> should have been deceived into the belief that a great and sanguinary battle was in progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>Never, since the beginning of this war, has there been heard in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> such a prolonged, terrible bellowing of big guns. </p> </div4>
