<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> We have bayer at any time desired to see on the port of the <rs>South</rs> any departure from the recognized rules of civilized warfare, except as that departure might be required by the violation of those rules by our Federal enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>But, deprecating most earnestly that barbarity and inhumanity falsely ascribed to our soldiers by <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> journalists, we insist that duty and mercy to our own people require that for every violation of the laws of war by the <rs>North</rs>, there shall be instant retribution as near in kind as possible by the <rs>Southern Government</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> The war began in a spirit and with declarations that would have warranted the <rs>South</rs> at the start in hanging out the black flag, and in neither giving nor asking quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The infernal beastliness openly proclaimed in the streets of New York and the bellish cruelties threatened by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Congress warranted such a resistance on the part of the <rs>South</rs> as that to which <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,W.,C.,,:1"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> sounded the key note when he shot down <persName n="Ellsworth,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Ellsworth,nomatch:0"><surname>Ellsworth</surname></persName> in <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>It is true that sobered by defeat, they have since that time disclaimed sundry brutalities, so shockingly beastly that the whole world cried out against them, but have they ever relinquished their bloody and inhumen purposes?, Do they not still hold the halter over the heads of all the chiefs of this rebellion?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Do they not arrest and thrust our peaceful citizens into jail for the crime of patriotism?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>We accept them as more or less the characteristics of every war and which may yet be resented in turn upon our execrated foe. But those infamous and inhuman departures from the rules of civilized warfare to which we have referred deserve and demand not only the reprobation of the world, but that retaliation which is the only means of civilizing savages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>The Government should bestir itself with fresh vigor and spirit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>It should inspire, by its own example, the army and the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>The cry everywhere should be, <q>&#x0022;To arms!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>To arms!&#x0022;</q> The thimred ranks of our gallant regiments should be filled &mdash; the officers should address themselves with perse verance to the matter of drilling and disciplining the troops for early movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>In all the departments of arms, ammunition, and supplies, there should be the greatest possible activity.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/> This is indeed the time to work &mdash; work &mdash; work!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>The enemy must not be allowed to recover from the blow just dealt him with such stunning force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>To pause now will ensure the overrunning of our country by the unscrupulous and brutal foe. To follow up our victory energetically and sagaciously, we will not only defend ourselves successfully, but will deprive him of all hope of subjugating us. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/> There are fields yet for glory where our Southern men are to stand up for their country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>The enemy is already pointing them out. There he must be met, and that promptly.--Delay encourages him and dispirits us. Camps breed disease and destroy more men than the battle field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>Action &mdash; action &mdash; action &mdash; is what preserves the soldier's health, fires his heart and binds the laurel of victory upon his brow. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/> <q>&#x0022;Retaliation&#x0022;</q> should be now the watch word.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>Defensive war is, under pecaliar circumstances, wise, and in our case has been unavoidable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>But at the earliest moment the enemy should be made to feel some of the horrors of invasive warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>We doubt not this sentiment is universal in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>To remain always on the defensive is fatal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>An apt illustration is the bear and dog fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>The bear (not the aggressive grisley, of <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName>,) acts entirely on the defensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>When <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attacked he generally overcomes his assailants of <num value="3">three</num> or more dogs, and as they back out' he drops upon his haunches, licks his chops, and awaits the renewal of the attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/>This takes place when the enemy is rested or <hi rend="italics">reinforced,</hi> and this is repeated until the bear is finally pinned by all <num value="4">four</num> paws, the tail and the jaw, and is declared whipped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>Had he followed up his early victory the destruction of his tormentors would have been an easy matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/>So it is with armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>It is fatal to remain steadily on the defensive. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/> It is gratifying to the <rs>Southern</rs> public to know that our able military <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> are fighting men; and we have the best reason for being assured that there is no such thing in their strategy as a permanently <hi rend="italics">defensive</hi> war. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>At an early period of the present troubles varions extracts from those speeches were published in our columns, and are probably familiar to most of our readers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>But the admiration is succeeded by the deepest sadness, when we remember how all those words of wisdom were thrown away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>Like the chosen people of old, who turned a deaf ear to the prophets, and even stoned and put them to death, our fathers refused to believe in that Future which <placeName key="tgn,2570615" n="1.000 1" reg="patrick henry, charlotte, virginia">Patrick Henry</placeName> predicted, and which their descendants, paying the penalty of their folly, are now realizing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>She would have possessed the <name>Might</name> to defend the <name>Right</name>, and, consequently, the <rs>North</rs> would never have troubled her.

<div4 type="entry" n="1"> 
<head>Something about those fights.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/> A correspondent of the <orgName n="New York Times" type="newspaper">N.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>We make some extracts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/> A fortnight has elapsed since the <hi rend="italics">bloody check sustained by our army</hi> at the <rs type="place">Seven Pines</rs>, redeemed by the glorious victory of <placeName key="possibilities=15" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Fair Oaks</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>That attack was deliberately planned by the rebels, and was expected to relieve them of the menacing presence of the army of the <name>Potoman</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>In this they were sadly disappointed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>Their purpose was utterly and disastrously thwarted; and although they inflicted upon us a severe and most serious loss, their own was far heavier not only in the number of killed and wounded, but in the thorough and remeddess defeat of a movement, skillfully conceived, vigorously executed, and which had every reasonable promise of, success. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/> The country is impatielit for another battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>Unless I am greatly nustaken, it will not have long to wait, though a day seems long, I am well aware, to an enger and unrefleeting public.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>I think it not at all unlikely that, if our army could have followed the rebels in full force into <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 7" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, after their repulse on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, the <date value="06-01">1st of June,</date> the city might have fallen into our hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>But this was physically impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>Only a portion of our forces &mdash; quite inadequate for such an enterprise &mdash; had crossed the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>; that portion had been most seriously weakened by the <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> battle: there were but <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> bridges then constructed which were available for the transit of troops, and even those were swept away the next day by the terrible storm which followed the battle.--That engagement, moreover, disclosed some facts which would not be neglected in any subsequent estimate of results, and foremost among them was <hi rend="italics">the courage and <unclear> </unclear> of the resistance offered by the rebels <unclear></unclear> arms.</hi> I have heard military men say that several times during the day they advanced in solid masses upon our batteries, and that the wide gaps made by each successive discharge were filled up repeatedly with a steady valor, which would have done credit to the veterans of any army in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="488"/>If will not do to rush upon such a foe without <hi rend="italics">counting the cost and preparing to meet it.</hi> And the time which has since elapsed has been thoroughly and wisely improved. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="489"/> I do not suppose any great harm could flow from a statement of the position of our forces, for I presume it is already very well known to the enemy, and the chances, moreover, are that it will be very essentially changed before this letter will see the light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>Still, I shall not venture upon any such indiscretions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>But there can be no harm in saying that a force is <hi rend="italics">now</hi> across the <name>Chickahemlay</name> sufficient, not only to repel any attack which may be made upon the left of our army, but also to follow up that repulse by a vigorous and effective pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>It is not believed that the rebels will venture upon another attack &mdash; at least not upon that wing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>If they attack at all, it will probably be upon the right, which they may deem weaker than the other, and where success would enable them to cut off our communications with <placeName key="tgn,7017623" n="1.000 8" reg="york, virginia, united states">York river</placeName>, and seize the large quantity of supplies collected at the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName>, on the <rs>Pamunkey</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="494"/>It seems not unlikely that the recent dash of their cavalry across our lines, and around the rear of our whole army, may have been preparatory to some such movement, though it does not seem to have been attended by any result of importance, in connection with such a scheme, except perhaps that it may have given them some better knowledge of the disposition of our troops, and of the extent to which our rear is unprotected. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/> But <persName n="McClellan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.01072" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>, I am inclined to think, does not intend to await their movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/><hi rend="italics">Unless they make have they will not be left to select their point of attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/><measure n="4days" type="date">Four days</measure> of hot weather had dried the roads and rendered the ground everywhere reasonably practicable for artillery, though the heavy rains had seriously damaged the condition of things in this respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/>But unless some new obstacle intervenes, I feel quite confident that the present week will witness a decisive trial of strength between the opposing armies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>It may possibly be postponed a little longer to insure the co-operation of gunboats on the <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName>, and the arrival of expected reinforcements; but I think not. The enemy evidently suppose that <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.01073" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> is to advance upon <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> from the direction of <placeName reg="Suffolk, Suffolk, Virginia" key="tgn,2114436">Suffolk</placeName>, for we have a report to-day that they have destroyed the railroad between those <num value="2">two</num> points.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>But whatever may be the fact about <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.01074" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>'s movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>I do not believe that <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.01075" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> will be delayed on account of them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/> On the <hi rend="italics">result</hi> of an attack, whenever made, <hi rend="italics">I do not think anybody in the army entertains a doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>Its success is considered certain.</hi> It is not generally believed here that the <hi rend="italics">effective</hi> force of the rebel army is much, if any over <num value="100000">100,000</num>; though in this estimate no account is made of the raw levies which that army embraces, and which will be of very little service except in their entrenchments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>Our officers have the utmost confidence in our troops, a confidence which has been immensely strengthened by the recent battles, and I do not think they would hesitate to lead them against a force at least half greater than their own, for a single instant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>This, of itself, counts largely in the estimate of results and the whole body of our army, officers and men feel certain of entering <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 7" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> whenever the <rs>Commending General</rs> will give the word. </p> </div4>

<head>The fights of the <num value="30" type="ordinal">30th</num> and <num value="31" type="ordinal">31st</num>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>The official reports of the battles of the <num value="31" type="ordinal">31st</num> and <num value="1" type="ordinal">1st</num> have not yet been all sent in. I think they will exhibit some considerable discrepancies, and lead probably to some controversies which I trust may be postponed, at least until this army has accomplished its work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>It will be contended, on the <num value="1">one</num> side, that <persName n="Casey,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.01076" reg="mostcommon:Casey,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Casey</surname></persName> allowed himself, through <persName n="Jack,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.01077" reg="mostcommon:Jack,nomatch:0"><surname>Jack</surname></persName> of proper precautions, to be surprised, and that neither this division nor that of <persName n="Couch,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.01078" reg="mostcommon:Couch,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Couch</surname></persName> sustained the shock of attack with sufficient steadiness and firmness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/>Very serious imputations upon the courage of these troops, as well as the capacity of their officers, have already been made, and I presume will not pass unnoticed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>On the other hand, and in their defence, it will probably be alleged that the force was pushed too far in advance considering its strength &mdash; that the attack upon it was foreseen to be inevitable, and was distinctly announced as impending on <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>--that reinforcements were not forwarded nor sent across the river, though repeatedly asked for, and that the list of killed and wounded, as well as the actual records of the case, prove that the troops thus forced to sustain a most unequal contest against <sic> ouerwhelming</sic> numbers, did not merit the censure which has been eat upon them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/> From what I learn of the facts I do not think it can be said that the attack of the enemy was sudden or unexpected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="513"/>The <num value="4" type="ordinal">Fourth</num> <hi rend="italics">corps d'armee,</hi> under <persName n="Keyes,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.01079" reg="mostcommon:Keyes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Keyes</surname></persName>, had been sent across the river a week previous, and pushed steadily forward to <placeName reg="Seven Pines, Marion, West Virginia" key="tgn,2119933">Seven Pines</placeName>, with a view of commanding both the roads which lead forward from that point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/><persName n="Keyes,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.01080" reg="mostcommon:Keyes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Keyes</surname></persName>, who is a vigilant, prudent and accomplished officer, more than once remonstrated, I have been told, against too rapid an advance in this direction and urged the importance of sustaining it by the transfer of a portion of the <orgName type="corps" n="Corps 3">Third Corps</orgName> across the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/><persName n="Heintzelman,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.01081" reg="mostcommon:Heintzelman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Heintzelman</surname></persName>, who commanded that corps, and who was soon after invested with the command of all the troops across the river, did not concur in these representations, and no such transfer was made, although it was pressed by <persName n="Keyes,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.01082" reg="mostcommon:Keyes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Keyes</surname></persName> with a good deal of pertinacity and although on Friday he reported, as the result of his careful personal examination, that the enemy was actually collected in very large force at every point of a semi circle described by a radius <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure> long, with his own <sic>headpuarters</sic> as a centre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/>The very next day the attack was made &mdash; the enemy sending out no skirmishers, but driving in our pickets, and falling instantly <hi rend="italics">on masse</hi> upon the front and both flanks of <orgName n="command"><persName n="Casey,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.01083" reg="mostcommon:Casey,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Casey</surname></persName>'s command</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/> This attack was prepared for and was intended to have been made on <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>, as we learn from the <rs>Richmond</rs> correspondence of the <rs>Southern</rs> papers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>The troops were brought forward and disposed for it. Why it was postponed we are not yet informed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>But the belief of the enemy was that we had about <num value="30000">30,000</num> men this side the <rs>Chickahominy</rs>; that the bridges were incomplete, and that the severe storm would so raise the water in the swamp as to make it very difficult to cross more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>They believed they could, therefore, annihilate this force, and made the attempt with not less than <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> men. That they failed completely in the effort is, of course, well known. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/> A flag of truce was sent over to the rebel camp on <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, to hold a conference with <persName n="Cobb,General,Howell,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.01084" reg="default:Cobb,Howell,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <foreName>Howell</foreName> <surname>Cobb</surname></persName>, on the subject of exchanging prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>It is said that he found <persName n="Cobb,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.01087" reg="nearbymention:Cobb,Howell,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Cobb</surname></persName> in fine health and spirits, ostentatiously confident of victory before, <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 7" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, but still more emphatic in maintaining that, even if we should take <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 7" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, we should have many other battles to fight before we should succeed in <q>&#x0022;conquering the <rs>South</rs>.&#x0022;</q> He was quite disposed to argue the whole question of secession, and found in <persName n="Key,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.01088" reg="mostcommon:Key,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Key</surname></persName> an opponent quite as ready to disenss the political as the military aspects of the controversy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>Nothing was decided, however, beyond this mutual agreement on the general issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/> From firing upon each other constantly, the pickets of the <num value="2">two</num> armies have passed to the opposite extreme, and are now frequently found in close companionship, having laid aside their arms for the time and exchanging newspapers or talking over the events of the day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>The telegraph has doubtless anticipated any statement of the fact of an attack, but there are many incidents which remain to be told. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/> By some unaccountable policy, the railroad, over which are transported the supplies which keep in motion the vast <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName>, over which heavily inden freight trains, crowded with supplies and troops and officers, were continually passing, has been left to be weakly guarded through the <num value="12">twelve</num> <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> miles of the track from <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName> to the <rs type="place">Chickahominy Bridge</rs>, by <num value="2">two</num> companies of the <orgName n="Tammany Regiment" type="militia">Tammany regiment</orgName> of New York, a picket force which was in some places so scanty as really to invite the attacks of marauding hands, but nothing of the magnitude of that which has startled these camps adjacefit to the line of the railroad was anticipated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="532"/>The rebels, who have fast friends all about here in the inhabitants of this miserable country, have easily informed themselves of the condition of things about the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName> and along the line of the railroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/> Persons of the highest respectability state that the train of wagons at <placeName reg="Berkeley, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002254">Berkeley</placeName>, to which we have twice before alluded, is still there, and that it is hourly increasing in numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>They now stretch out along the banks of the river for miles, and stand in rows <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> deep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="850"/>Yesterday, all the gunboats and transports which had been up in the neighborhood of <placeName reg="Shirley, Charles City, Virginia" key="tgn,2660001">Shirley</placeName> and Curles's Neck on <dateStruct><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> and <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct>, had dropped down in the vicinity of <placeName reg="Berkeley, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002254">Berkeley</placeName>, and were passing up and down shelling the woods in that section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="852"/>This is doubtless an exaggeration, but all who have seen them state their probable number at a very high figure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="853"/>It is conjectured by some as probable that <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.01258" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> contemplates making <persName n="Berkeley,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.01259" reg="mostcommon:Berkeley,nomatch:0"><surname>Berkeley</surname></persName> a base of operations for another <q>&#x0022;onward march to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 7" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>,&#x0022;</q> and therefore he is causing his wagons and other valuables to be congregated at this point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="855"/>This is mere conjecture, but it does seem a little remarkable that he should expose so much valuable material at <placeName reg="Berkeley, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002254">Berkeley</placeName>, unless he contemplated protecting it in some way. It may be that he relies on his gunboats for protection until he can find more leisure to remove it than has been at his disposal recently. </p>
