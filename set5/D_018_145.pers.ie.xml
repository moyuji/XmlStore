<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>(Applause.) There are no enemies to this Union except the honest, virtuous, conscientious people of the <rs>North</rs>, whose action is to be feared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The South have not offended us. We cannot say they have ever laid finger upon us. They have not invaded our domain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>They have not interfered with any interests belonging to us as sovereign States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>But they read in our newspapers that their slaves have been run off by an <orgName n="Underground Railroad" type="railroad">underground railroad</orgName>, and they see it set down in derision that <num value="1">one</num> more Southern individual has been robbed of his property.--<num value="1">one</num> more slave, instead of having been returned according to the compact of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, has been run off into the provinces of <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>You cannot send forth a stream by any natural process that will rise higher than a fountain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The South know it. They have no faith in addresses and resolutions that have not their sources in the feelings of the masses of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>It is useless to say there is no serious trouble.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>I believe that <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> will secede, so far as the movement of her Convention can do it, on the <date value="17,18">17th or 18th</date> of this month, and events must transpire shortly after which will bring all cotton States in association with her, and eventually every State which is a slave State, and intends to continue such, will go along together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>This is as certain as the laws of gravity, and he is a blind man and madman who cannot see it. All that we can now do is to get time to convince the <rs>Southern</rs> people that there is a returning sentiment of truth and justice in the <rs>Northern States</rs>; that the honest masses have been misled and have misunderstood this irritating question, as I believe they have, and upon proper consideration will go back to their duty as members of this Confederacy, and will welcome back our Southern brethren to the great family of political, social and moral equals.

<head>Postage stamps.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1775"/> The question <q>&#x0022;what becomes of all the plus?&#x0022;</q> is <num value="1">one</num> which has for a long time puzzled the brains of many anxious inquirers after knowledge, and notwithstanding the humorous reply of some classical with, that <q>&#x0022;they fall to the earth and become <hi rend="italics">terrapins,</hi>&#x0022;</q> the mystery of the ultimate fate of those useful contrivances remains as far from a satisfactory solution as ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1776"/>It would probably be less difficult to find an answer to an inquiry as to what becomes of all the postage stamps, and yet in view of the immense number which are daily produced, issued and consumed, the subject could hardly fail to strike any <num value="1">one</num> with a taste for statistics, as a suggestive and truthful <num value="1">one</num> for investigation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1777"/>It is not our purpose, however, to enter upon this task at present, but simply to give our readers a glimpse at the <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">modus operande</hi></foreign> of the sale of these convenient articles, as conducted at our largest <orgName n="Post Office" type="office">post-office</orgName>, New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1778"/>Although the demand for postage stamps is of course almost universal, yet in a city like this, with its large and varied population, the individual consumption is much less evenly distributed than that of almost any other article in such general use. With some, the purchase of stamps is an event of comparative rarity, and an item of but small importance in their yearly expenses, while with others it is a matter of daily necessity, and entails an expense which their annual balance sheet shows to be no trifle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1779"/>To accommodate both these classes of purchasers, the department for the sale of stamps and stamped envelopes at the <rs type="place">New York office</rs> is divided into <num value="2">two</num> sections, in <num value="1">one</num> of which all transactions to the amount of <measure n="1dollars" type="currency">$1</measure> and upwards are carried on, while the other supplies the more limited wants of those who desire to procure smaller quantities, down to a single &#x0022;<num value="1">one</num>-center.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1780"/> Let us step for a few moments into the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> mentioned office, which is situated at the head of the staircase leading to the entrance to the offices of the <rs>Postmaster</rs>, <rs type="role2">Secretary</rs> and Cashier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1781"/>At a counter within the enclosed space formed by a high partition, stands the clerk who presides over this department, busily employed in dealing out to the numerous customers sheets and portions of sheets of stamps of divers colors, and bearing different devices, and could we peep behind the partition, we should see snugly stowed within in the recess of a capacious &#x0022;salamander,&#x0022; a goodly pile of his stock in trade, sufficient, <num value="1">one</num> might think, to supply the needs of all the letter-writers of the city for months.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1782"/>This, however, he informs us, is but the remains of the fast invoice received from the <name>Department</name>, and were it not for the fact that a fresh stock is now on its way, the constant demand would soon exhaust the supply &mdash; thereby producing a public excitement which might be better imagined than described. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1783"/> This office is open from <time value="9am">9 A. M.</time> to <time value="3pm">3 P. M.</time>, and the average sales now amount to about <measure n="2000dollars" type="currency">$2,000</measure> per day, and are constantly increasing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1784"/>The late regulation of the <name>Department</name> by which the prepayment of all postage, both on foreign and domestic letters, is obliged to be made in stamps, has caused a large increase in the sales, as formerly many persons preferred paying their foreign postage in money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1785"/>Until within a short time the <num value="12">12</num> cent stamp was the highest denomination issued, but the large amount which sometimes is required for the payment of but <num value="1">one</num> foreign letter necessitated the use of those of a higher value, and accordingly <num value="2430">24,30</num> and <num value="90">90</num> cent stamps are now sold making <num value="8">eight</num> different denominations issued by the <name>Department</name>, viz: <num value="1">1</num>, <num value="3">3</num>, <num value="5">5</num>, <num value="10">10</num>, <num value="12">12</num>, <num value="24">24</num>, <num value="30">30</num> and <measure n="90cents" type="currency">90 cents</measure>. Of course <num value="1">1</num> and <num value="3">3</num> cent stamps are in greatest demand, though on &#x0022;steamer days&#x0022; the higher denominations form a large portion of the sales.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1786"/>In paying large amounts of postage, the number of <num value="10">10</num> and <num value="12">12</num> cent stamps which it was sometimes found necessary to affix for the purpose, often increased, by their weight, the amount payable, to the extent of an additional rate &mdash; an objection entirety done away with by the use of the larger denominations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1787"/> From the opening until the closing hour, the counter is <unclear></unclear> by a steady stream of customers; and &#x0022;queer customers&#x0022; some of them are, as we may discover by a few minutes' observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1788"/>Here comes <num value="1">one</num> evidently from the &#x0022;rural district,&#x0022; a keen, cautious-looking individual, who saunters in a leisurely way, evidently determined not to betray, by the exhibition of undue haste, any anxiety to purchase, and unwilling to part with his money except upon the most favorable terms, and after all the solemn formalities of a regular bargain-making.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1796"/> <q>&#x0022;We can't allow any discount, sir, and we don't take any money except <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs>, &#x0022;</q> says the clerk, with business-like brevity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1797"/> <q>&#x0022;Well, but you see I want to get a good lot of 'em &mdash; may-be <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="7dollars" type="currency">seven dollars'</measure> worth, and if you--&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1798"/> <q>&#x0022;Give me <measure n="300dollars" type="currency">three hundred dollars'</measure> worth of threes,&#x0022;</q> says a bank-clerk, who has been waiting the issue of this colloquy with an amused grin on his countenance, but who can't spare the time to enjoy it longer, depositing on the counter a double handful of half-eagles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1799"/>The gentleman from <placeName key="tgn,7007251" n="1.000 2052" reg="illinois">Illinois</placeName> eyes the glittering pile with eager eyes, and watches the clerk as he carefully counts over the <num value="100">hundred</num> sheets. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1800"/> <q>&#x0022;Don't they allow you no discount?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1801"/> <q>&#x0022;No, sir,&#x0022;</q> says the bank clerk; <q>&#x0022;you don't catch <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Sam</foreName></persName> allowing discount &mdash; don't do business in that way.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1802"/> And the western customer, his visions of a &#x0022;bargain&#x0022; effectually dissipated, departs for <address><street n="Wall street">Wall street</street></address> to have his &#x0022;<placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> money &mdash; good as wheat,&#x0022; converted (at a modest &#x0022;shave&#x0022;) into more available currency. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1803"/> Presently in steps an unmistakable Cockney &mdash; a very recent arrival.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1804"/><q>&#x0022;On, give me a queen's lead, please,&#x0022;</q>--laying on the counter <num value="0.5">a half</num> crown. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1805"/> <q>&#x0022;Give you what, sir!--what's a queen's lead!&#x0022;</q> says the puzzled clerk. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1806"/> On, a queen's lead, you know &mdash; a &mdash; a thingamajig &mdash; what'd you call it &mdash; a stamp, you know a shilling' stamp &mdash; I've just arrived 'ere by the <name>Hasia</name>, you know, and I want to send this letter home, to let the old folks know I've got here safe, you know--'ere's half a crown, I haven't a shillin', you know.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1807"/> He is directed to the retail stamp window, with a recommendation there to supply himself with a <num value="24">24</num> cent stamp as a substitute for a &#x0022;queen's lead.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1809"/>So resisting the temptation to refer him to a menagerie as the only place where his zoological tastes might chance to be gratified, the clerk supplies him with the <num value="200">two hundred</num> envelopes and he departs triumphant. </p>
