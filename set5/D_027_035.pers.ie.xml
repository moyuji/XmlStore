<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The news yesterday was very meagre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>All was quiet at <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>; but it is said that the movements of the enemy's wagon trains, and the unusual dust hovering over his camps, showed that some movement of troops was taking place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>It is probable that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> is moving more men to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>It is further stated that he is removing some of his heavy guns from in front of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, but this is hardly probable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Directly those guns leave the front of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, <persName><foreName>Ulysses</foreName></persName> cases to be a <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> From <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName> there is nothing further.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>It may be proper to state that the enemy's fleet menacing that city is very much in the same position, as far as chances of success through its own efforts are concerned, as a fleet menacing <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> from below <placeName reg="Drewry's Bluff, Chesterfield, Virginia" key="tgn,2295265">Drewry's Bluff</placeName> would be. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>He had cut the railroad, and was on his way to <placeName reg="Macon, Bibb, Georgia" key="tgn,7013980">Macon</placeName> to liberate <num value="1200">twelve hundred</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> officers confined there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>He got within <placeName><distance reg="3miles">three miles</distance> of <placeName reg="Macon, Bibb, Georgia" key="tgn,7013980">Macon</placeName></placeName>, and was repulsed and turned back &mdash; Unhappily, however, for him,. <persName n="Wheeler,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Wheeler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Wheeler</surname></persName> had sent <num value="3">three</num> brigades of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> cavalry in his rear, and when he turned to go back, he found them in his front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>They had the only road he could get-off by, and he formed his troops to cut his way through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>This trouble was spared him by the <rs>Confederates</rs> making the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> charge and driving him <measure n="2miles" type="distance">two miles</measure>. Just as they were about to make another charge, he sent in a white flag, surrendering unconditionally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>He and his staff took off their arms and handed them over to <persName n="Crew,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Crew,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Crew</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Stoneman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Stoneman,nomatch:0"><surname>Stoneman</surname></persName>, sitting down on a log near by, took a good cry. <num value="600">Six hundred</num> of his men surrendered with him, but the rest broke into the woods, where they were followed and pretty thoroughly killed or captured by our men. We took <measure n="600" type="prisoners">six hundred prisoners</measure>, <num value="1000">one thousand</num> horses and <num value="2">two</num> pieces of cannon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>These raiders had spread desolation along the track they had marched.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>They had entered private houses and stripped ladies' fingers and breasts of rings and pins; broke open drawers and trunks, stole silver and plate of every description.--In many instances, house girls were ravished in rooms before their mistresses, and in yards in front of the houses. </p> </div4> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> It will be recollected that a few weeks since our Government sent <num value="56">fifty-six</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> officers, including <persName n="Wessel,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Wessel,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Generals</roleName> <surname>Wessel</surname></persName>, <persName n="Seymour,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Seymour,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Seymour</surname></persName>, <persName n="Shaler,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Shaler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Shaler</surname></persName>, <persName n="Hickman,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Hickman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Hickman</surname></persName> and <persName n="Scanmon,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Scanmon,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Scanmon</surname></persName>, to <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, to be placed in prison there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>They were placed in an elegant mansion in the western portion of the city, near the <placeName key="tgn,2139122" n="1.000 4" reg="ashley river, south carolina, united states">Ashley river</placeName>, so far out of range that the only shell that burst near them was <num value="1">one</num> which exploded the day before their exchange.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>They enjoyed themselves in a fine court-yard with games of ball, &#x0026;c., and also had a very fine bath-house at their disposal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>Several communications have been received by his Honor from parties cognizant of the roughness shown by the watchmen towards the white ladies who were at <persName n="Pendleton,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00128" reg="nearbymention:Pendleton,James,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Pendleton</surname></persName>'s on the night in question, and it has even been alleged that <num value="1">one</num> of the officers so far forgot himself in his efforts to establish a reputation for vigilance in catching a negro, as to deliberately knock a lady down who, unintentionally, happened to get in his way. These complaints, the <rs>Mayor</rs> stated, were of frequent occurrence and of such a character as to entitle them to some attention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>He intimated that at some future time he should demand the name of the man said to have struck the lady alluded to, when he should not only be dismissed from the service, but should be otherwise punished for his brutal behavior.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>It had been alleged that some of the watchmen who had previously been apprised of contemplated unlawful gatherings of negroes, purposely lurked around and waited until the assemblage took place, so that they could have the opportunity of rushing upon and carrying them to the watch-house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>This was very reprehensible, and the guilty parties were admonished of the consequences of a repetition of this conduct in future, as well as instructed that it was their duty, when information was received prior to the commission of an offence, to take steps towards intercepting it, instead of waiting in readiness to pounce upon the offenders as soon as the plan was matured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>The <rs>Mayor</rs> also alluded to the conduct of an ex-watchman, who arrested a negro woman and afterwards released her upon the payment of a bribe of <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">ten dollars</measure>, and expressed his intention to hand him over to the grand jury for indictment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>In concluding his homily, he took occasion to refer to the almost invariable practice of the watchmen of hunting about for runaway negroes during the day, and, as a consequence, when <sic>nght</sic> came, they were incapacitated, from the want of sleep, to attend to their duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>It was no part of their duty to put themselves out of the way to catch runaway negroes, and in future they shall not be permitted to do so. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>They took hold of his limbs and found them supple and easy to move about, thus indicating to their mind that he had not been long dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>The only person who could give them any information about the manner of the boy's death was the wife of the prisoner, who said that he died from consumption; had been sick a long time, and was attended by <persName n="Shead,Doctor,Albert,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00134" reg="default:Shead,Albert,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>Albert</foreName> <surname>Shead</surname></persName>, who she knew would substantiate her statement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>The boy looked very much emaciated; had about his head and arms various bruises and scratches, but none of them were regarded as of sufficient character to produce the death of a person in health.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>Subsequently, they learnt from <persName n="Thomas,Doctor,H.,M.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00135" reg="default:Thomas,H.,M.,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <foreName>M.</foreName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName>, whose office is next door, that he had frequently heard Kothe inflicting severe blows upon the deceased, and knowing his delicate condition, it attracted his attention, and once or twice he had intended telling the owner of the boy that if he desired to save the life of his servant, he had better take him away.--, a witness for the defence, stated that the negro died about <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time> <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>. At <time value="9oclock">nine o'clock</time> he was solicited by <persName n="Kothe,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00136" reg="nearbymention:Kothe,William,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Kothe</surname></persName> to go in to see him; that she believed he had a fit on him, and she was unable to render any assistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>He did so; found him in the stable in an apparently dying state; could not assist him, and left in a few minutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>He knew nothing of the whipping; understood he was whipped <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct>; was certain that he died <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>.--At this juncture the <rs>Mayor</rs> announced that he should proceed no further till he could procure the attendance of the physician who attended the boy, and other witnesses, who were important in the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>He referred to the very vague and indefinite procedure on the part of the <rs>Coroner</rs>'s inquest, and said that it was his own opinion that a <hi rend="italics">post mortem</hi> examination should have been held over the body; but instead of that, no witnesses had been summoned before the <rs>Coroner</rs>, but the jury of inquest simply assembled, and without any deliberation, rendered a verdict of death from natural causes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>In this connection, the <rs>Mayor</rs> remarked that the <rs>Coroner</rs> appointed by the <orgName n="Hustings Court" type="court">Hustings Court</orgName> (<persName n="Peachy,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00137" reg="mostcommon:Peachy,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Peachy</surname></persName>) was a gentleman of distinguished attainments, but unfortunately he was deterred from performing his duty in consequence of protracted and serious illness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>He was not aware that the acting Coroner possessed any remarkable knowledge of medical jurisprudence, and felt very sure he was not a man of much legal knowledge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>He therefore adjourned the matter over till <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct>, and intimated that he should, in the meantime, have the body disinterred and a <hi rend="italics">post mortem</hi> examination held over it. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>Witnesses for the <rs>Commonwealth</rs> proved that the horse was taken from <num value="1">one</num> of our batteries in the neighborhood of the city, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>, and that on <name>Saturday</name> he was found in the possession of <persName n="Primus,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00139" reg="mostcommon:Primus,nomatch:0"><surname>Primus</surname></persName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/> It is related that when Ole <persName n="Bull,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00222" reg="mostcommon:Bull,nomatch:0"><surname>Bull</surname></persName> gave his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> concert at <rs n="Natchez" type="nativeamerican">Natchez</rs>, while his glory was yet in its <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> freshness, on the occasion of his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> visit to <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName>, an old planter living in the neighborhood was so carried away by his feelings that nothing less would serve him than to teach a negro fiddler of his own to rival the great <rs n="Norwegian" type="group">Norwegian</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>This he confidently believed he could do. So, upon returning home, he summoned &#x0022;Old Rosin&#x0022; to his presences dilated in raptures upon what he had heard and seen declared that he had the secret &mdash; that it all consisted in the handling of the bow &mdash; and that he could teach it effectually in a single lesson. &#x0022;Now,&#x0022; said he, &#x0022;false your fiddle and I will take the poker, and I will soon show you how to work the wires.&#x0022; How he succeeded history does not tell; but as we have heard of no ebony rival of Ole <persName n="Bull,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00223" reg="mostcommon:Bull,nomatch:0"><surname>Bull</surname></persName> in that quarter, the inference is quite fair that he did not succeed at all. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/> The generation of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> correspondence remind us forcibly of this planter whenever a new scheme is on foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>No matter what it may be &mdash; whether <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00224" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> be trying to &#x0022;outflank his own shadow,&#x0022; or to storm the <orgName n="Confederate Battery" type="battery">Confederate batteries</orgName> by a direct attack in front &mdash; whether he determine to fight it out on this line, if it takes all summer,&#x0022; or to flank himself entirely out of this line to the south side of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName> &mdash; whether he be meditating a raid upon the <orgName n="Weldon Railroad" type="railroad">Weldon railroad</orgName>, or a grand blow-up of the <rs>Confederate</rs> earthworks, these enterprising gentry never fail to frustrate the mystery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>And they always, in advance, attribute to it the greatest possible degree of success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>They know it <hi rend="italics">must</hi> succeed, and they know <hi rend="italics">why</hi> it must succeed. &#x0022;It all lies in the bow,&#x0022; and they have found out how the bow is to be handled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>They cannot tell &mdash; no, no, the secret is so awful that it will not bear telling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>They can only deal in hints and innuendoes, sufficiently expressive to let all the world, and <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00225" reg="nearbymention:Lee,N.,M.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> besides, into the secret of the manner in which the bow is to be handled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>They know all the details so well that they could teach all Yankeedom how to do it as easily as the planter taught his darkey how to handle the bow like Ole <persName n="Bull,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00226" reg="mostcommon:Bull,nomatch:0"><surname>Bull</surname></persName>.--Doubtless that great instructor in the art magical was greatly disappointed when he failed to make his pupil handle the bow like Ole <persName n="Bull,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00227" reg="mostcommon:Bull,nomatch:0"><surname>Bull</surname></persName>, but not more than the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> instructors in the art military usually are, when their last piece of strategy follows in the footsteps of all the rest, and turns out, like <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00228" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> himself, to be neither more no less than a gigantic fizzle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>Not more, we venture to say than was the pupil of the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName>, who, after having sat for months at the feet of his military gomaliels, expresses his disappointment in the following woeful sentence: &#x0022;Every conceivable precautionary measure was taken to insure success &mdash; no project ever promised more favorable results &mdash; and officers are alike surprised and mortified at our failure to carry the enemy's entire lines and possess ourselves of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>Unless it be the <name>Chinese</name>, no population ever existed so entirely childlike in its credulity where its own success is involved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>So perfectly have their <dateStruct value="-07-4"><day reg="4">Fourth</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> orations convinced them that they are the mightiest nation on the earth, that they will believe anything which flatters their national vanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>The slightest glimmer of success, in the smallest enterprise is sufficient to console them and to re-kindle the war spirit in the midst of the most overwhelming and most dispiriting disasters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>The capture of the <rs>Alabama</rs> caused them to forget <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00230" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s <num value="150000">150,000</num> men slaughtered to capture <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, and the capture of a few ships at <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName> will entirely obliterate all lingering recollection of their heavy failures in all quarters during this campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>Their press &mdash; the greatest curse ever entailed upon a nation as it there exists &mdash; encourages all this by its monstrous falsehoods with regard to events which have already occurred and its extravagant predictions with regard to the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>They can never know the truth, for the war is, to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> press, the goose that lays the golden egg, and they are too sagacious in money matters to rip it up at once. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/> In assessing the average value of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class artillery and wagon horses and mules at <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">$500</measure> we designed that the term should be accepted and acted upon according to its obvious common sense import.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>In other words, that they should be selected, and then impressed according as their working qualities and adaptation to army service, together with their <unclear></unclear> value, would warrant a judicious purchaser in considering them as coming within the contemplation of the commissioners when they as seated the average value of such horses as the government needed at <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">$500</measure>; but cases might arise, however, when the public exigencies would be as urgent as to demand that <hi rend="italics">all</hi>horses at hand should be impressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>Yet, under ordinary circumstances, when family or extra blooded horses, or brood mares of <hi rend="italics">admitted high value</hi> are impressed, we respectfully suggest to the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> to have instructions forwarded to the impressing officers to propose and allow the owners to <hi rend="italics">substitute</hi> in their stead such strong, sound, and serviceable horses or mules as shall be considered and valued by competent and disinterested parties as <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class artillery horses or <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class wagon mules. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/> The terms average value per head is in contradistinction to a fixed and uniform price for each horse or mule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>We supposed that in impressing a number of horses or mules, whether owned by several persons or <num value="1">one</num> individual, that some might be estimated at <measure n="300dollars" type="currency">$300</measure>, and others at different advanced rates, according to their worth, up as high as <measure n="700dollars" type="currency">$700</measure>--thus making an <hi rend="italics">average</hi> value or price for a <hi rend="italics">number</hi> of good, sound, and efficient horses or mules <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">$500</measure> each. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/> In I Instauration of our views, we will add that a horse with only <num value="1">one</num> eye sound might, in all other respects, be classed as a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class artillery horse, yet the loss of <num value="1">one</num> eye would justly and considerably curtail his value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>So a horse from <num value="10">ten</num> to <measure n="13years" type="date">thirteen years</measure> of age might be deemed in all other particulars as a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class artillery horse, but, of course, however officiant, or able to render good service for a year or so, yet his advanced aged would justly and materially impair his value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>Any horse, however he may approximate the standard of a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class artillery home, must, according to deficiencies, faithless the maximum price; and as few comparatively come up to the standard, and, therefore, are entitled to the maximum price; so of course in all others instances the price should be proportionately reduced as imperfections place them below the standard of <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> class, &#x0026;c., </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>Therefore, we assure the <unclear></unclear> value of artillery of wagon bested or mules, impressed since the passage of the corrence bill of the <dateStruct value="-02-17"><day reg="17">17th</day> <month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> last, <unclear></unclear> This award will entitle each person to receive higher compensation, accordingly an each horse or mule recently impressed may be considered as being a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, or <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> class artillery or wagon horse or mule, whether the portion appeal to our Board or not; and the impressing agents and officers should forth with call on all of those persons of whom they impressed horses or mules and propose a sattlemend upon the foregoing boats.
