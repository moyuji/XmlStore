<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>He conceded to a loyal man all the rights over his property that he ever had under the <rs>Constitution</rs>; but if it should ever come to a question between slavery and Union, then he would be ready to wage a war of utter extermination against slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>He thought that the loyal men in the <rs>South</rs> were as ready to yield as much as any party of citizens for the sake of the <rs>Government</rs>, even, if necessary, to fire up slavery; but, unless necessity demands such a sacrifice, they should be protected in their property the same as other citizens. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/> In regard to the property of the rebels &mdash; the movable property &mdash; he thought that it might be taken as the property of enemies under the rules of war. We might take a negro like other movable property, and it needed no further legislation.
