<head><orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">Army of the Potomac</orgName>.</head> <byline>[<hi rend="italics">our own correspondent.</hi>]</byline> <opener> <dateline> <name type="place">Outpost, near Fairfax,</name> <date value="12-04">Dec. 4th.</date> </dateline> </opener> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> On the morning of <date value="12-01">December 1st</date> an order was issued to <persName n="Rosser,Captain,T.,L.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="default:Rosser,T.,L.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <foreName>T.</foreName> <foreName>L.</foreName> <surname>Rosser</surname></persName>, <orgName type="regiment" key="2Company">2d company</orgName> <orgName n="Washington Artillery" type="artillery">Washington Artillery</orgName>, to proceed to the outposts with his battery, with a full complement of men and horses, to relieve <orgName n="Battery"><persName n="Latham,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Latham,nomatch:0"><surname>Latham</surname></persName>'s Battery</orgName>, there on duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Although suffering from a recent illness he made hasty preparations, and in less than half an hour was on <address><street n="Fairfax road">Fairfax road</street></address>. Desiring to see something more of life on the advance posts, I gladly accepted his kind invitation to accompany the battery, and am now writing from the bivouac, about <measure n="1.5miles" type="distance">one and a half miles</measure> this side the town of <placeName reg="Fairfax, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,7014159">Fairfax</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> Perhaps an idea of outpost duty may not be amiss at the beginning of my letter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>In maintaining an army in the face of an enemy the general principles as well as the details are interesting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Some miles before, but still within supporting distance, a commander places his advance guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>From this guard the advance pickets, the sentinels, and the videttes are thrown out, and also flankers and patrols.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>To give a better idea of it, imagine a force encamped in the form of a rectangle, stretching out several miles, the distance in proportion to the size of the army, or it may be regulated by the character of the country to be attacked or defended. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> From this advanced guard the pickets, sentinels, videttes, and flankers are thrown out, upon a fan-shaped ground plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Regiments are placed in the form of a semi-circle; these send out pickets in the same form, stationing them about <measure n="800yards" type="distance">eight hundred yards</measure> away; still farther on, gradually widening the semi-circle, is a line of sentinels, and <measure n="1500yards" type="distance">fifteen hundred yards</measure> from these; are the cavalry pickets, or videttes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>On either side of the advance guard the flankers are placed, and between it and the outpost, the sentinels and videttes, the patrols are in constant motion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The outer line of infantry sentinels are very close to each other, and form an impassable barrier to friend or foe, unless provided with the proper passes or signals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The videttes are stationed upon hills that overlook the roads and avenues leading to or from the lines, and are constantly occupied in watching the movements of the enemy, sending back couriers with any information, or at any signs of an advance of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>If pressed by a superior force, the videttes fire their pieces and retire slowly, keeping the advancing force in view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The infantry pickets skirmish to the rear also, and retard the movements of the enemy until the long roll in the advanced guard has called a large force to arms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> In our Army we have artillery upon the outposts, to retard still longer the motions of an advancing foe, and a large cavalry force to prevent its being cut off and captured.--Our videttes are now stationed about <placeName><distance reg="100yards">one hundred yards</distance> beyond <placeName reg="Fairfax Court-House">Fairfax Court-House</placeName></placeName>, and stretch from thence towards <placeName reg="Vienna, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2114749">Vienna</placeName> and Frying pan, to the <name>north</name> and <name>south</name>ward, sweep around towards the <rs>Occoquan</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Behind these come the infantry, and still further behind the artillery and cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>I may mention also that behind the main body of the <orgName n="Army" type="military">Army</orgName> is the <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName>, arranged very nearly the same as the advanced guard, maintaining all the time strict vigilance and careful attention to duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>In case of an advance upon our lines by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Army, it will not be made in a direct line, but an effort to flank the position will be attempted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>When the pickets and the flankers on <num value="1">one</num> side or the other are driven in, the <num value="2">two</num> Armies will probably be in the shape of <num value="2">two</num> right angels, <num value="1">one</num> within the other. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> That may be the general plan, but of course the lines will vary and change form according to the circumstances of the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Were the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> as confident of success as at <placeName reg="Bull Run, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013988">Bull Run</placeName> they might advance in solid column up on some point they supposed weaker than another. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> Theoretically we can make most beautiful plans for the advance of the enemy, and can imagine excellent ambuscades, strategies, and defeats, but when we come down to the matter of fact question, <q>&#x0022;Will he come?&#x0022;</q> the splendid imagery is of little interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Day by day the hope of a fight dwindles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The general principles upon which the belief of an advance was based now fail to produce the shadow of a hope, and it is generally conceded that if a fight occurs it will be purely accidental.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> still say they believe there will be a fight within <measure n="60hours" type="date">sixty hours</measure>, or <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure>, or <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure>, as the case may be, but if I really thought they believed it would come upon this line, half my confidence in them would be gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>What may happen down on the river is more than I can tell, but as for this line &mdash; I give it up. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> As I have said in a former letter, the commander of the outpost is <persName n="Stuart,,J.,E.,B.," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="default:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>, the youngest Brigadier in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>He now has charge of the <orgName n="Cavalry Brigade" type="brigade">cavalry brigade</orgName>, and has headquarters but a few miles from where I am now writing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>As the cavalry is constantly opposed to the enemy, and as <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName> is <num value="1">one</num> of those energetic, brave spirits that are never idle, the enemy are kept in a constant state of alarm, and have their line harassed, their pickets captured, and their dreams disturbed by visions of flashing sabres and Black Horse cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>To <num value="1">one</num> fond of reading tales of the border, the merry life in the green wood, the daring feats of <persName n="Marion,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Marion,nomatch:0"><surname>Marion</surname></persName> and his gallant band, or any of the stories of strategic warfare in the old world or the new, there is no better place for the realization of his dreams or the longings of his soul than in the camp of <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Something exciting is constantly on the tapis; some scouting party or some dashing band of rangers constantly in the saddle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Would you like to see the record of the past month devoid of all the little episodes of spirited personal rencontres?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Read the following spirited orders by <persName n="Stuart,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="nearbymention:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>: </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>There must be a model, or at least a delineation, to make the idea at all complete and adequate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>The description we shall give, of the proposed flag is only such as to enable the reader to prepare a model or design of it. We are not word painter enough to make the flag stand out before the eyes-- visible by mere force of language. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/> The discussion of the objections to the present flag, has, we hope, elucidated the principles for the selection of another &mdash; showing, at least, what a flag ought <hi rend="italics">not</hi> to be, if not what it should be. Distinctness, appropriateness, beauty, are to be consulted in their due order. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/> Before presenting his own favorite suggestion, the writer would refer briefly to the proposed <q>&#x0022;Southern Cross.&#x0022;</q> This does not seem to him to be, by any means, a nail in a sure place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>Aside from the objections of those who regard with suspicion any symbol of connection of Church or State--or, who consider this the symbol of a particular religious denomination --there are graver difficulties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>The <hi rend="italics">seeming</hi> appropriateness of the <name>Cross</name> is all confined to the <hi rend="italics">name.</hi> The Southern Cross itself has no appropriateness North of the <name>Equator</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>Who ever saw it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>Not the writer, certainly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>Probably not <num value="1">one</num> of his readers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>Not <num value="1">one</num> in <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> of our people ever saw it. Perhaps a large majority --including all the uneducated &mdash; never heard of it. In <placeName reg="South River, Rockbridge, Virginia" key="tgn,2681713">South</placeName> <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs>, or <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>, it would be appropriate enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>It might do for <placeName reg="Brazil, Clay, Indiana" key="tgn,2031163">Brazil</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>But we know much more here of the constellation of the <name>Great Bear</name>, near the <rs>North</rs> pole, than of the <rs>Southern Cross</rs> near the <rs>South</rs> pole.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>So far from having any hold upon the national heart, it is not even known by sight, or name, to the mass of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>No solitary endearing association, no lodgment in the affections or regard of the people, furnishes any foundation on which to build the loyalty and attachment of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>In general appearance it is, perhaps, not sufficiently distinct from the flag of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>--the nation with which next to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, we are most likely to be confounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>But were it entirely distinct, it is sufficient to say that any other flag, adopted at random, would be equally appropriate with the <rs>Southern Cross</rs>, which has no solitary association in the history of our people, nor root nor fibre in their hearts. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/> Our criticisms have perhaps ere this set our readers upon edge, and prepared them to receive, in a very critical spirit, our own suggestion, and to reject it at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> blush.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>But we have faith in it, if considered with candor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>And its obvious appropriateness, we are sure, will grow with reflection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>The hypocritical may hesitate and weigh, but the heart of the people will respond to it; the universal heart, cultivated and uncultivated, alike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>For it is a big and broad sympathy to which it appeals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>The flag we propose would consist of <num value="3">three</num> belts and <num value="2">two</num> triangular spaces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>, a broad blue belt, passing diagonally from the lower corner of the flag, next the staff, to the upper corner, farthest from the staff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>On each side of the blue belt a narrower belt of white.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>The remaining triangular spaces red, viz: the corner next the staff above, and the corner most remote from it below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>The disposition of the tri-colored belts is both unique and beautiful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>In the centre of the broad blue belt, (which represents the zodiac, or track of the sun in the heavens,) we would represent the sun in his ascending pathway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>This is the appropriate symbol of our country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>We dwell in the land of the sun. No other natural feature is so prominent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>The sun is dear to us, at home and abroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>At home we enjoy and rejoice in it. Abroad, in more inhospitable climes, we pine and long for it. The name by which we most love to call our country is the <q>&#x0022;Sunny South.&#x0022;</q> It is the predominance of sunshine here which forms the most striking feature to strangers who visit us. Let us then &mdash; not in arrogance, as the symbol of affected superiority over others &mdash; nor as the token of any political creed or institution &mdash; but in grateful acknowledgment and appreciation of this prime blessing of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, adopt the <q>&#x0022;Flag of the <rs>Sun</rs>&#x0022;</q> as the symbol of our land &mdash; as that which at home and abroad recalls its dearest features &mdash; makes as love and cherish it &mdash; willing to foster, defend, and if need be, fight for it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/> The mind may dwell long upon it before finding another symbol so characteristic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>We are not afraid to challenge reflection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>Indeed, the appropriateness is obvious, and recognized by all. But there are deeper reasons which may bear investigation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>Adopt this flag, and you have a broad natural foundation for the loyalty of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>They will love it instinctively, and at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>The difference between the attachment to it and to <num value="1">one</num> less appropriate, will be like that of a parent to an adopted child and to his own. The former is the result of time and habit &mdash; the latter of nature and instinct <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and then of time and intercourse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>Wherever our people see it, the light will revive the dearest associations of their native end. Amid the fogs of old <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, how would the sight of it stir up deep memories and longings for the sunny land of home ? It is our peculiar happiness that an object so grand and beautiful should likewise be appropriate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>It is the emblem of all we would like our country to be &mdash; of light, of warmth, of beneficence, of cheerfulness, of glory. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/> It will be observed that <hi rend="italics">distinctness</hi> is attained in an unusual degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>The most conspicuous portion of a flag is the upper corner, near the staff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>This is best supported, and never concealed behind other portions or folds of the flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>This portion is filled with red, the most conspicuous of colors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>The only distinctions possible are those of shape and color.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>The proposed flag differs widely from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> flag in both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>A <hi rend="italics">triangle of red</hi> in the <num value="1">one</num> occupies the space filled in the other by a <hi rend="italics">square of blue.</hi> The diagonal belts are peculiar also to this flag, representing the varied hands of fight often seen across the heavens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>The general effect of the flag must be seen to be appreciated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>It is fine &mdash; indeed, we think happening. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/> To this flag <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> objections may be urged, already listed at. <num value="1">One</num>, that it might be interpreted <unclear></unclear> an assumed superiority <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> over other nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>The other, that it does not symbolize our political institutions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>For neither purpose, however, is it intended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>We simply adopt a grand natural feature of our country as an appropriate emblem.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>If the party objecting to this should chance to be the <rs>North</rs>, we might towards them afford to indulge a little fanciness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>They are of the night, we of the day. It is fit that the stars should disappear when the sun rises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>The sunshine of freedom dispels darkness and its emblems. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/> As to political institutions, it is not important nor usual that a flag should symbolize a form of government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>The Thistle of <placeName key="tgn,7002444" n="1.000 148" reg="scotland">Scotland</placeName> &mdash; the <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> <rs type="ship2">Shamrock</rs> &mdash; the <rs>British</rs> and <rs>French</rs> flags &mdash; have no political significance.--The flag of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> once represented States--separate and sovereign &mdash; but that principle has been repudiated by them and has lost all its appropriateness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>There is no reason why the <rs>North</rs> should now love its flag.--The old motto <q>&#x0022;<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="lat"><persName n="Unum,,E.,Pluribus,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00101" reg="default:Unum,E.,Pluribus,,"><foreName>E.</foreName> <foreName>Pluribus</foreName> <surname>Unum</surname></persName></foreign></hi>&#x0022;</q> they have, in fact, if not in form, rejected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>It is all <q>&#x0022;<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="lat">unum</foreign></hi>&#x0022;</q> now, without any <q>&#x0022;<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="lat">pluribus.</foreign></hi>&#x0022;</q> Their defied Ape has abolished the <q>&#x0022;<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="lat">pluribus,</foreign></hi>&#x0022;</q> converting States into mere counties, and making the flag a stupid solecism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>In it they perpetuate the evidence of their own treason to the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the original principles on which the <rs>Government</rs> was founded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>It is a living rebuke to the traitors who kept the symbol and have abolished the reality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>They proclaim it no longer a galaxy of stars &mdash; but the stars fade into a pale, nebulous group.--The glory has departed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/> Let us not symbolize our form of Government, but our land itself, by adopting its grand natural characteristic as the emblem of our nationality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>The sun in a peculiar sense is ours &mdash; let us claim our heritage and gladden in all lands the heart of every son of the <rs>South</rs> who sees his nation's flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>It will speak for itself to his heart, and every association will hallow the original impression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>No broader foundation could be laid for a nation's love and loyalty.--How would the heart of the people have been knit to it already, had it been adopted at the beginning of our brief, but already glorious history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>But it is not too late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>Let us have this new bottle, sound and free from taint for the new wine still being pressed from us &mdash; the blood of the brave, spilled in its defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>It is noble in itself &mdash; noble in its suggestions &mdash; a fit symbol in prosperity &mdash; a cheering <num value="1">one</num> in adversity &mdash; fit for peace &mdash; fit for war. A flag to live under &mdash; to fight under &mdash; to conquer under &mdash; to die under.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>The dying soldier, lifting his last expiring glance to the rising sun on its folds, would find the symbol of hope to his country in the flag of the sun. </p> </div4> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>A few of the faint-heated and credulous believed these reports; and were probably thinking about packing up and getting ready to make themselves scarce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/>It was suggested, however, that no able bodied men, old or young, should be allowed to run off. Some were thinking about their wives, daughters, cousins, and sweethearts.
