<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>He fancied he had a great &#x0022;card,&#x0022; as he called it, in &#x0022;universal suffrage,&#x0022; which he proposed to introduce in a State where there existed a freehold qualification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>He broke down in his <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> speech, but he consoled himself by declaring to his friends that, though he had made himself ridiculous, &#x0022;universal suffrage&#x0022; was, nevertheless, &#x0022;a great card. &#x0022; &#x0022;I am ashamed to death of myself,&#x0022; said he to a sensible old man, the minister of Slickville,--&#x0022;but <hi rend="italics">it was a great card</hi> I had though, if I had only <hi rend="italics">played it right;</hi> a very <hi rend="italics">great card indeed.</hi> In fact, it was more <hi rend="italics">than a card</hi>--it <hi rend="italics">was high, low, Juck, and the game.</hi>&#x0022; &#x0022;What was it?&#x0022; said the minister &#x0022;Univarsal suffrage,&#x0022; says <persName><foreName>Sam</foreName></persName>. &#x0022;Do you know what that means?&#x0022; said the minister. &#x0022;To be sure I do,&#x0022; says <persName><foreName>Sam</foreName></persName>, &#x0022;it's every man havin' a vote and voice in makin' those laws that is to govern him; and it comports with reason and stands to common sense.&#x0022;--&#x0022;Well,&#x0022; says the minister, &#x0022;it amounts to this, and nothing more nor less: Now men of property and character make laws to govern rogues and vagabonds; but, under your beautiful scheme, rogues and vagabonds will make laws to governmen of property and character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>It is reversing the order of things; it is worse than nonsense; it is downright madness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>We shall then have wound up the fearful tragedy of our revolution with as precious a farce as folly and licentiousness ever produced.&#x0022;--&#x0022;Minister, &#x0022; says Slick, &#x0022;I don't know how it is, but you have such a shorthand way of puttin' things that there is no contradictin' you.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>But it is a singular coincidence, that events should seem to sustain the minister's prediction. --Before the introduction of that excellent card, universal suffrage, the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> population was as orderly and contented a population as could be found under the sun. Judges were independent, defaulting sheriffs a rarity, and abolitionism impotent for mischief, But, from the moment that the inestimable gift of universal suffrage was bestowed upon the people, things took a downward turn, and the popular madness ended at last, not in a &#x0022;farce, &#x0022; but in such a tragedy as the world has rarely seen. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>It was read and adopted in secret session, and the seal of secrecy removed on the <dateStruct value="--16"><day reg="16">16th instant</day></dateStruct>: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> The select committee to whom was referred so much of the <rs>President</rs>'s message of the <dateStruct value="--13"><day reg="13">13th instant</day></dateStruct> as relates to the action of Congress during the present session having duly considered the same, respectfully submit the following report: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> The attention of Congress is called by the <rs>President</rs> to the fact that, for carrying on the war successfully, there is urgent need of men and supplies for the army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> The measures passed by Congress during the present session for recruiting the army are considered by the <rs>President</rs> inefficient; and it is said that the results of the law authorizing the employment of slaves as, soldiers will be less than anticipated, in consequence of the dilatory action of Congress in adopting the measure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>That a law so radical in its character, so repugnant to the prejudices of our people, and so intimately affecting the organism of society, should encounter opposition, and receive a tardy sanction, ought not to excite surprise; but if the policy and necessity of the measure had been seriously urged on Congress by an Executive message, legislative action might have been quickened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName>, in no official communication to Congress, has recommended the passage of a law putting slaves into the army as soldiers, and the message under consideration is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> official information that such a law would meet his approval.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The Executive message transmitted to Congress on the <date value="11- 07">7th of November</date> last suggests the propriety of enlarging the sphere of employment of the negro as a laborer, and for this purpose recommends that the absolute title to slaves be acquired by impressment, and, as an incentive to the faithful discharge of duty, that the slaves thus acquired be liberated, with the permission of the <name>States</name> from which they were drawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>In this connection, the following language is used: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> &#x0022;If this policy should recommend itself to the judgment of Congress, it is suggested that, in addition to the duties heretofore performed by the slave, he might be advantageously employed as <hi rend="italics">pioneer and engineer laborers;</hi> and, in that event, that the number should be augmented to <num value="40000">forty thousand</num>. <hi rend="italics">Beyond this limit and these employments it does not seem to me desirable, under existing circumstances, to go</hi>&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="The Executive message"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> In the same message the <rs>President</rs> further remarks: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> &#x0022;The subject is to be viewed by us, therefore, solely in the light of policy and our social economy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/><hi rend="italics">When so regarded, I must dissent from those who advise a general levy and arming the slaves for the duty of soldiers.</hi>&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="President further"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> It is manifest that the <rs>President</rs>, in <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> last, did not consider that the contingency had then arisen which would justify a resort to the extraordinary policy of arming our slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Indeed, no other inference can be deduced from the language used by him; for he says: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> &#x0022;These considerations, however, are rather applicable <hi rend="italics">to the improbable contingency of our need of resorting to this element of resistance than to our present condition.</hi>-- </p> </q><bibl n="The President,"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> The <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, in his report, under date of <date value="09-03">November 3d,</date> seemed to concur in the opinion of the <rs>President</rs> when he said: </p> <cit><q rend="break">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/> &#x0022;While it is encouraging to know this resource for further and future efforts is at our command, <hi rend="italics">my own judgment does not yet either perceive the necessity or approve the policy of employing slaves in the higher duties of soldiers.</hi> </p> </q><bibl n="The Secretary of War"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> At what period of the session the <rs>President</rs> or <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> considered the improbable contingency had arisen, which required a resort to slaves as an element of resistance, does not appear by any official document within the knowledge of your committee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Congress might well have delayed action on this subject until the present moment, as the <rs>President</rs>, whose constitutional duty it is &#x0022;to give to the <rs>Congress</rs> information <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> of the state of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>,&#x0022; has never asked, in any authentic manner, for the passage of a law authorizing the employment of slaves as soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The Senate, however, did not wait the tardy movements of the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/><date value="1864-12-29">On the 29th December, 1864, </date> the following resolution was adopted by the <name>Senate</name> in secret session: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">Resolved,</hi> That the <rs>President</rs> be requested to inform the <name>Senate</name>, in secret session, as to the state of the finances in connection with the payment of the troops; the means of supplying the munitions of war, transportation and subsistence; the condition of the army, and the possibility of recruiting the same; the condition of our foreign relations, and whether any aid or encouragement from abroad is expected, or has been sought, or is proposed, so that the <name>Senate</name> may have a clear and exact view of the state of the country, and of its future prospects, and what measures of legislation are required.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> In response to this resolution, the <rs>President</rs> might well have communicated to the <name>Senate</name> his views as to the necessity and policy of arming the slaves of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> as a means of public defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>No answer whatever has been made to the resolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>In addition to this, a joint committee was raised by Congress, under a concurrent resolution adopted in secret session on the <date value="1864-12-30">30th December, 1864.</date> That committee, by the resolution creating it, was instructed, &#x0022;by conference with the <rs>President</rs>, and by such other means as they shall deem proper, to ascertain what are our reliable means of public defence, present and prospective.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> A written report was made by the committee on <date value="1865-01-25">January 25th, 1865; </date> and, although it had a conference with the <rs>President</rs>, no allusion is made in the report to any suggestion by him that the necessities of the country required the employment of slaves as soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Under these circumstances, Congress, influenced, no doubt, by the opinion of <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Lee,N.,M.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, determined for itself the propriety, policy and necessity of adopting the measure in question. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> The recommendations of the <rs>President</rs> to employ <num value="40000">forty thousand</num> slaves as cooks, teamsters, and as engineer and pioneer laborers, was assented to, and a law has been enacted at the present session for the purpose, without limit as to number. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/> All the measures recommended by the <rs>President</rs> to promote the efficiency of the army have been adopted except the entire repeal of class exemptions; and some measures not suggested by him &mdash; such as the creation of the <orgName>office of <rs type="role" reg="General-in-Chief">General-in-Chief</rs></orgName>--were originated and passed by Congress, with a view to the restoration of public confidence and the energetic administration of military affairs. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> On the subject of exemptions, the <rs>President</rs>, in his message of <date value="11-07">November 7th,</date> uses the following language: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> &#x0022;No pursuit nor position should relieve any <num value="1">one</num> who is able to do active duty from enrollment in the army unless his functions or services are more useful to the defence of his country in another sphere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>But it is manifest that this cannot be the case with entire classes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>workmen in mines, professors, teachers, engineers, editors and employees of newspapers, journeymen printers shoemakers, tanners, blacksmiths, millers, physicians, and numerous other classes mentioned in the laws, cannot, in the nature of things, be either equally necessary in their several professions, nor distributed throughout the country in such proportions that only the exact numbers required are found in each locality, &#x0022;etc. </p> </q><bibl n="The President"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> The casual reader would infer that the laws, as they stood at the date of the message, exempted the classes enumerated by the <rs>President</rs>, as well as many other classes not mentioned by him. Such is not the fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The only class exemptions allowed by the laws then in force were the following: <rs type="role" reg="Minister">Ministers</rs> of religion; superintendents and physicians of asylums for the deaf, dumb and blind, and of the insane; <num value="1">one</num> editor for each newspaper, and such employees as the editor may certify on oath as indispensably necessary; the public printers of the <rs>Confederate</rs> and State Governments, and their journeymen printers; <num value="1">one</num> skilled apothecary in each apothecary store, who was doing business as such on the <date value="1862-10-10">10th of October, 1862; </date> physicians over <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> of age, and for the last <measure n="7years" type="date">seven years</measure> in practice; presidents and teachers of colleges, seminaries and schools, and the superintendents, physicians and nurses in public hospitals; certain mail contractors and drivers of post- coaches; certain officers and employees of railroad companies; and certain agriculturists or overseers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> <rs type="role" reg="Officer">Officers</rs> of the <rs>State Governments</rs> are not properly included among the exempted classes, because it is conceded that Congress has no constitutional power to conscribe them as soldiers. --Nor are Drunkards, <rs n="Quaker" type="religion">Quakers</rs>, or other non-combatants, regarded as belonging to class exemptions, because, under the act of <date value="1864-06-07">June 7, 1864,</date> the exemption of these persons is subject to the control of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>The exemption of agriculturists or overseers between the ages of <num value="18">eighteen</num> and <num value="45">forty-five</num> has been repealed at the present session.--Tanners, shoemakers, millers, blacksmiths, telegraph operators, and workmen in mines, enumerated by the <rs>President</rs> as among the classes exempted, are not now, and have not been since the passage of the act of <date value="1864-02-17">17th of February, 1864, </date> exempted as a class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>If railroad officers and employees, and State officers, who are not constitutionally subject to conscription, be excluded, the classes now exempted east of the <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231">Mississippi river</placeName> embrace about <num value="9000">nine thousand</num> men--<num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of whom are physicians, and nearly another <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> are ministers of the gospel; the remaining <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> is principally composed of teachers, professors, <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> printers and employees in newspaper offices, and apothecaries. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/> In remarkable contrast to the number of persons relieved from military service by the exemptions above mentioned, the report of the <rs type="place">Conscript Bureau</rs> exhibits the fact that, east of the <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231">Mississippi river</placeName>, <num value="22035">twenty-two thousand and thirty-five</num> men have been detailed by Executive authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>In consequence of this abuse of the power of detail, Congress, at its present session, passed an act revoking all details and limiting the exercise of that power in the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="3Section">third section</orgName> of this act, exempting skilled artisans and mechanics from all military service, which is excepted to by the <rs>President</rs>, and which has since been repealed, was originally adopted in consequence of suggestions contained in the report of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>In alluding to the embarrassments encountered by the administrative bureaus, the <rs>Secretary</rs> says: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/> &#x0022;In addition, they have been constrained, by the stringent legislation of Congress, to relinquish their most active and experienced agents and employees, and substitute them from more infirm and aged classes.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="Secretary"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/> Again: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/> &#x0022;Interferences of this kind are inevitably so prejudicial and disturbing that it is hoped a well-devised and permanent system of providing and retaining in continuous employment a sufficient number of artisans, experts and laborers, for all essential operations, may be devised and established.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="Secretary"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> The truth is, that the bill originally introduced into the <name>Senate</name> exempting skilled artisans and mechanics was actually prepared in <num value="1">one</num> of the bureaus of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Congress, therefore, had reason to suppose that it would meet the sanction of the <rs>Executive</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/> To conscribe the ministers of religion, and require them to obtain details to preach the <name>Gospel</name>, would shock the religious sentiment of the country and inflict a greater injury on our cause than can be described.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>The conscription of editors and of the printers necessary to the publication of newspapers would destroy the independence of the press, and subject it to the control of the <orgName n="Department of the Executive" type="government">Executive Department</orgName> of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/><unclear></unclear> railroad officers and employees are as necessary to the prosecution of the war as soldiers in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>Physicians and apothecaries are essential to the health of the people, and no complaint has reached Congress of abuses in this class of exemptions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>If the education of youth be regarded as conducive to the maintenance of society and the preservation of liberty, it is not perceived that the exemption of professors of colleges and teachers of schools can be justly censured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>The Senate passed a bill containing a section repealing the exemption allowed to mail contractors and drivers of post-coaches; but, at a subsequent stage of proceedings, and on the recommendation of a <orgName n="Conference Committee" type="committee">committee of conference</orgName>, based on the urgent remonstrances of the <rs type="role" reg="Postmaster General">Postmaster-General</rs>, the section alluded to was stricken out. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/> The subject of class exemptions was called to the attention of Congress by the <rs>Executive</rs> message of <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>It was carefully considered, and an act was passed expressive of the views of the <rs>Legislative Department</rs> of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>The message under consideration recurs to the same subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>It is to be regretted that the views of the <rs>Legislative Department</rs> of the <rs>Government</rs> have not met the favor of the <rs>Executive</rs>, and that he should deem it both necessary and proper to express dissatisfaction with the matured opinion of Congress. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/> It is true that Congress has failed to respond to the recommendation of the <rs>President</rs> to enact a general militia law. The subject was considered, and the failure to act was the result of deliberation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>The conscription laws enacted by Congress have placed in the military service of the country all its able-bodied citizens between the ages of <num value="17">seventeen</num> and <num value="50">fifty</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>The whole military material of the country, so far as legislation is concerned, is absorbed by the conscription acts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>There is none left on which a militia law can operate except the exempted classes, and the boys under <num value="17">seventeen</num>, and the men over <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> of age. It was deemed expedient to allow this material to remain subject to the control of the <rs>State</rs> authorities for the purposes of local police, to aid in the arrest of deserters, and to enforce the administration of State laws. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/> It is also true that the <rs>President</rs> has recommended the passage of a law suspending the privilege of the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus.</hi> This recommendation was the subject of a special message, in secret session.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>It occupied the attention of Congress for <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="5weeks" type="date">five weeks</measure>.--After mature deliberation, the measure was laid aside as unimportant and inexpedient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Spies can be arrested and tried summarily without suspending the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus.</hi> Conspiracies, tending in any manner to the injury of our cause, were provided for by a special act, passed at the present session, &#x0022;to define and punish conspiracy against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.&#x0022; The States of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, had expressed, through their Legislatures, great repugnance to the past legislation of Congress suspending the writ, and a large portion of the people throughout the country was arrayed against the policy of that legislation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>It was deemed wise and prudent to conciliate opposition at a time when dissensions are ruinous; and as the benefits to be derived from the suspension of the writ <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> were conjectural, the deliberate judgment of Congress was expressed by its silence on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>It is to be regretted that the <rs>Executive</rs> does not concur in these views, and again calls on Congress to revise its action, and to suspend the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> as a measure &#x0022;almost indispensable to the successful conduct of the war. &#x0022; If the facts state in the <rs>Confidential Message</rs>, alluded to by the <rs>President</rs>, be the basis of the opinion that the suspension of the writ &#x0022;is indispensable to the successful conduct of the war,&#x0022; the <rs>Congress</rs> does not concur in that opinion.--The writ has not been suspended since <dateStruct><month>August</month></dateStruct> last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>It is not perceived that the military reverses of the country since that period were occasioned by the absence of the legislation asked for. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/> In regard to impressments, Congress, at the present session, has passed a bill declaring that the terms &#x0022;just compensation,&#x0022; as used in the <rs>Constitution</rs>, entitle the owner whose property is impressed to the market value thereof at the time and place of impressment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>This legislation was considered necessary, in consequence of judicial decisions in some of the <name>States</name>, and because of the difficulty of procuring supplies on any other terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>Indeed, it was supposed that the <rs>Executive</rs> had reached the same conclusion, as the <rs type="role" reg="Commissary-General">Commissary-General</rs>, on the <date value="1864-12-20">20th December, 1864,</date> had advertised that he would pay for supplies the price fixed by local appraisement; which is, in fact, the market price.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName>, in his Annual Message of <dateStruct value="-11-"><month reg="11">November</month></dateStruct> last, did not call the attention of Congress to any difficulties attendant on the execution of the impressment laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>The present message, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time during this session, suggests modifications of those laws; and the recommendations of the <rs>President</rs> will doubtless receive the respectful consideration of Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>It may well be doubted, however, whether the present specie value, payable in the future, will induce the owner of property to part with it; and whether the passage of such a measure would not result in a general concealment of provisions, and consequent starvation of the army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/> It is apprehended by the <rs>President</rs> that some degree of embarrassment in the management of the finances will be felt in consequence of the inadequate provision made by Congress; and it is intimated that some of the measures recommended by him were so retarded as to lose much of their value; and others, after being matured, were, for the same reason, abandoned, because no longer applicable to our altered condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>The only financial measure abandoned after being matured was the currency bill, recommended by the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> and indorsed by the <rs>President</rs> in his Annual Message.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>It may be remarked that the failure to enact any fiscal measure, which has not sufficient vitality to render it valuable and applicable for the short period of <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure>, does not deserve much regret.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>The currency bill was recommended to Congress, and based on the condition the finances presented by the <rs>President</rs> in his message, and by the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> in his report.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>It was abandoned without regret, because, at a subsequent period of the session, it was ascertained that the arrears of public debt constituting cash demands on the <name>Treasury</name> exceeded, by nearly <num value="400000000">four hundred millions</num>, the amount originally reported to Congress by the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>The currency bill contemplated the reduction of the currency to <num value="150000000">one hundred and fifty millions</num> by a conversion of treasury notes into tithe certificates, payable after the war, and by an annual application of a portion of the taxes in the nature of a <orgName n="Sinking Fund" type="fund">sinking fund</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>The treasury notes received for tithe certificates were to be canceled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>The military reverses, which impaired the credit of the <rs>Government</rs> to such an extent as to destroy the salability of any of its bonds, left little hope that treasury notes would be exchanged for tithe certificates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>As soon as the enormous increase in the arrears of debt was discovered, as above mentioned, all idea of reducing the currency was abandoned as impracticable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>For these reasons, the <orgName n="Conference Committee" type="committee">committee of conference</orgName> having charge of the currency bill agreed to abandon it as a useless pledge of future resources without corresponding present advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>Indeed, if the bill had been passed the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day of the session it would have expired from inanition on the <date value="1865-01-09">9th of January, 1865,</date> the day on which the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> reported to Congress the deficit of <num value="400000000">four hundred millions</num>, and recommended an increase of taxation to meet it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/> The tax bill is regarded by the <rs>President</rs> as liberal, though inadequate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>No nation on earth ever conducted a protracted war by resources derived from taxation alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>The message intimates a regret that the recommendation by the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> of a tax on agricultural income equal to the augmented tax on other income, payable in treasury notes, was rejected by Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>This is evidently a mistake, as it assumes there has been an increase of taxes on other than agricultural incomes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>The present income taxes are those laid by the act of <date value="1863-04">April, 1863,</date> as amended and re-enacted on the <date value="1864- 02-17">17th of February, 1864.</date> To require the agriculturist to pay a tax on the income derived from his farm in addition to the <num value="1">one</num> <num value="10" type="ordinal">tenth</num> of his <milestone unit="column" n="6"/> gross productions, and the property tax of <num value="0.09">nine per cent.</num> <hi rend="italics">ad valerous,</hi> would be manifestly unjust and oppressive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>After the delivery of his tithe, to tax the income of the agriculturist derived from the property producing the tithe, would leave little for family subsistence, for the purchase of supplies necessary for carrying on his agricultural operations, and for the payment of the <hi rend="italics">ad valerous</hi> tax on his property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>Congress, therefore, did not concur in the recommendation of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs>, believing it to be highly inexpedient. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/> The recommendations of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> have, in the main, received the approbation of Congress, and every disposition has been manifested to co-operate with him. The tax bill adopted very nearly approximates the rate desired by him. He recommended <num value="0.1">ten per cent.</num> On property.--Congress has imposed a tax of <num value="0.09">nine per cent.</num> A new foreign loan was authorized in secret session, at his request, without any limitation on his authority except as to the amount.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>A transfer of certain sterling funds abroad was, by joint resolution, directed to be made from the <orgName n="Navy" type="military">Navy</orgName> to the <name>Treasury</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>Efforts were made to raise specie.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>A bill was passed in the <name>Senate</name>, in secret session, to accomplish that object by the sale of certain licenses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>It is understood the bill was defeated in the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName> by the acquiescence, if not at the instigation, of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>It appears from the correspondence submitted to Congress that the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs>, as early as the <date value="02-18">18th of February,</date> notified the <rs>President</rs> of the embarrassed condition of his Department; and it is to be regretted that the <rs>Executive</rs> deliberated on, and postponed for so long a period as nearly <measure n="20days" type="date">twenty days</measure>, the communication of that information to Congress. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/> If loss of time be a vice inherent in deliberative assemblies, promptitude is a great virtue in Executive action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>There is every disposition on the part of Congress to comply with the recommendations of the <rs>President</rs>, and some means of raising the coin desired will, no doubt, be devised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>It is unfortunate that the necessity for coin in the <orgName n="Commissary Department" type="department">Commissary Department</orgName> was not made known until the message under consideration was received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>The use of coin in <num value="1">one</num> department of the <rs>Government</rs> is calculated to superinduce the necessity for its use in all other departments; and hence the policy of the proposed measure, in a financial view, is very questionable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>The necessity for supplies, however, overrides all other considerations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>If practicable, it would be wiser to employ the specie in the purchase of treasury notes, and then use the notes to obtain supplies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/> Nothing is more desirable than concord and cordial co-operation between all departments of Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>Hence your committee regret that the <rs>Executive</rs> deemed it necessary to transmit to Congress a message so well calculated to excite discord and dissension.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>But for the fact that the success of the great struggle in which the country is engaged depends as much on the confidence of the people in the <rs>Legislative</rs> as in the <orgName n="Department of the Executive" type="government">Executive Department</orgName> of the <rs>Government</rs>, the message would have been received without comment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>Your committee would have preferred silence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>It has been induced to an opposite course, because they believe Congress would be derelict in its duty to permit its legitimate and constitutional influence to be destroyed by Executive admonitions, such as those contained in the message under consideration, without some public exposition of its conduct. </p> <closer> <salute><persName n="submitted,,Respectfully,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="default:submitted,Respectfully,,,"><foreName>Respectfully</foreName>  <surname>submitted</surname></persName>.</salute> <lb/> <signed><persName n="Oer,,James,L.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="default:Oer,James,L.,,"><foreName>James</foreName> <foreName>L.</foreName>  <surname>Oer</surname></persName>,</signed> <persName n="Chairman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Chairman,nomatch:0"><surname>Chairman</surname></persName>, <lb/> <signed><persName n="Semmes,,Thomas,J.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="default:Semmes,Thomas,J.,,"><foreName>Thomas</foreName> <foreName>J.</foreName>  <surname>Semmes</surname></persName>,</signed> <lb/> <signed><persName n="Graham,,W.,A.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="default:Graham,W.,A.,,"><foreName>W.</foreName> <foreName>A.</foreName>  <surname>Graham</surname></persName>,</signed> <lb/> <signed><persName n="Caperton,,A.,T.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="default:Caperton,A.,T.,,"><foreName>A.</foreName> <foreName>T.</foreName>  <surname>Caperton</surname></persName>,</signed> <lb/> <signed><persName n="Watson,,John,W.,C.," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="default:Watson,John,W.,C.,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>W.</foreName>  <foreName>C.</foreName>  <surname>Watson</surname></persName>.</signed> </closer> </div3> </div2> </div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>In the speculation itself there was little novelty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>We now learn, on official authority, that this characteristic idea has been not only entertained, but deliberately discussed and considered, by the representatives of the belligerent Governments in conference assembled.
