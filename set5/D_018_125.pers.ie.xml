<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The associated <rs>Banks</rs> of this city have followed up their action of <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>, in the direction of relief, by a further and more general movement, this afternoon, <hi rend="italics">for meeting the until promptly and boldly by unlimited expansion,</hi> or by an expansion limited only by the legitimate business wants of their dealers.--To this end they have virtually resolved to make common their whole stock of specie, saw about <num value="20000000">twenty millions</num>, and if, with the exchanges everywhere in favor of New York, at home and abroad, the public want the specie simply because they distrust its continued existence with the <name>Banks</name>, they can help themselves freely to it, without reference to the particular Bank in which their deposits are held.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>All will pay while the sum total insets, and if the sum now in hand (and which is likely soon to be increased from <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>,) be insufficient to answer the demands of the suspicious or incredulous, they will all go down together, and with the satisfaction of accommodating, to the last dollar, the reasonable wants of every solvent dealer, and the legitimate requisitions of the great trade of this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>This plan of relief, or mode of meeting a crisis, though new to this country, is the approved and successful policy, under similar circumstances, of the <rs>National Banks</rs> of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, and the reasons which impel it to success, with the exchanges all right, are, in the present sound condition of a trade simply overtaken by panic, perfectly irresistible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>And, for <num value="1">one</num>, we have little question of its wisdom if carried out, as we have every reason to believe it will be, with the same boldness of action and unanimity of purpose, as well as mutual good faith, which inspired it. </p> </q><bibl n="The Times"></bibl></cit>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> We desire to express no hasty opinion or confidence as to how this matter is to work.--Its success in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> and <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName>, in seasons of trial, has, we believe, been invariable &mdash; certainly in the <rs>English</rs> capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>But, come what may, this much we do rejoice at, that the bankers of the <placeName type="city" key="tgn,7007567">city of New York</placeName> have made their Association a real and substantial unit, resolving that it is better, if need be, to go down together, and in advance of general mercantile bankruptcy, which a different course might entail, in the effort to arrest the panic by expansion, rather than seal their own folly and shame by breaking in the process of cruel contraction. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> Our commercial community, we think, will hall with satisfaction the result of a meeting of bank officers held yesterday afternoon.--Had it been earlier, it had been better; but it comes at last, and brings with <hi rend="italics">it relief,</hi> before it is too late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The only requisite in a crisis like this is <hi rend="italics">confidence,</hi> and wise and bold action on the part of our banks to inspire it, by expanding their operations to the extreme of their ability, and in such a manner as will afford the greatest relief to the mercantile class, for whom banks are specially created, and have their being.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>It is no time now for banks to board and thus cast down merchants, on the ground that thus alone they can stand up themselves; but it is a time for banks to give out with a liberal hand, in order that both merchants and banks may stand up together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>It is a time, in short, when banks should not be found wanting when they are really wanted, and the resolutions above, on the part of the bank officers, show nobly a willingness and determination to meet the present emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>We read in them that New York banks, and business, at least, will go through and survive the fire that secession and panic politicians have raised about them With a prosperity unparalleled around us, there never has been any real occasion for financial panic, and we think this will be proved to be so in the effects of the action of our bank officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>While, therefore, great credit is due to them for the bold and liberal course they have taken, the commercial community is to be congratulated on the cheering promise which it gives. </p> </q><bibl n="The Courier and Enquirer"></bibl></cit>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The influence of this action was very favorably felt in the street, in the course of the afternoon, and paper was more saleable at lower rates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/><placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> funds were quoted at <num value="0.01">1 per cent</num> discount.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The <rs type="place">Stock Market</rs> at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> Board was lower, but the proceedings of the bank meeting had the effect to improve prices at the <num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num> Board. </p> </q><bibl n="The Philadelphia Ledger"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> Notwithstanding all these favorable symptoms, however, I am bound in duty to add, that the prevailing opinion among bankers and merchants, is that there will be a total suspension of specie payments here in less than <measure n="30days" type="date">thirty days</measure> from date &mdash; the great fact sticking out that the cause of all the present trouble &mdash; threatened revolution at the <rs>South</rs>--still exists, and is not likely to be got rid of soon. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The <orgName n="Baltimore American" type="newspaper">Baltimore American</orgName> says commercial affairs showed a much more cheerful aspect <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct>, after the suspension of the <name>Banks</name>, and the <name>Banks</name> discounted freely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>It will likely be some days, however, before entire confidence is restored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>We heard of strictly <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class paper being sold on the street to-day at <num value="0.09">9 per cent.</num>, but the regular rate was <num value="0.01">1 per cent.</num> per mouth; of course there is nothing doing in <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>-class.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>It will be seen under the telegraph is head that the <rs>Philadelphia Banks</rs> suspended specie payments at <time value="1oclock">one o'clock</time> to-day, and also that the <rs>New York Banks</rs> had resolved to make common stock of their specie, and pay it out as long as it lasts, but it is generally supposed here, among those who ought to know, that they will probably all suspend before the close of the week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Our <persName n="Banks,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Banks,Charleston,,,:1"><surname>Banks</surname></persName> have been pretty liberal in paying out specie to-day in small amounts to those who were in need of it. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/> --We are pleased to find that the practice of making the scholars learn all their lessons during school hours has been adopted in a portion of our public schools, and it will, doubtless, be extended to them all. We hope that this step is but the beginning of a great reform, and that the whole practice of stuffing the mind with a mass of undigested matter will be abandoned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>An eager desire to make a great show for the time or for the money expended is the most pernicious vice of our educational system; it leads to a hasty slurring over of lessons half understood and begets a habit of being satisfied with vague ideas, which is very apt to continue through life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>The most rapid mode of teaching is that which requires every lesson to be thoroughly mastered and comprehended before it is passed by. A scholar with this habit of study will soon overtake another who is far in advance with crude and superficial notions of his studies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>If parents or teachers are very anxious that a child should learn rapidly, let them insist that the lessons shall be few and short; no more than the child can learn both thoroughly and easily.--<hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Scientific American" type="newspaper">Scientific American</orgName>.</hi> </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/> We write this article in the country; time, <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct>, <date value="1860-11-11">11th November, 1860.</date> The sky is overcast &mdash; the air is cool and bracing &mdash; not a breath of air is stirring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>We never saw a more glorious day for shooting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>All sportsmen know that on such a day the birds come out into the open field, whereas they are apt to take to the woods when the weather is very bright, as it is almost sure to be during the <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> Summer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>Game, we are told, is very abundant every where.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>Partridges fly up in the fields at every <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> or so, and bares abound in all directions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>Sportsmen seem disposed to make the most of the season, and the fear is that they may make too great havoc with the game.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>To this abundance there is <num value="1">one</num> exception, and that an important <num value="1">one</num>, in the district from which we write.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>It is said that the race of wild turkeys is nearly extinct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="344"/>We are sorry for it, with all our hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>The turkey is certainly the noblest of all our feathered game.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>It is very hard to kill, where the huntsman is unacquainted with its habits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>We recollect reading, or hearing, we do not know which, of an old <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian's</rs> attempting to describe the difference between the shyness of a turkey and the shyness of a deer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/><q>&#x0022;When you are crying to get a shot at a deer,&#x0022;</q> said he, <q>&#x0022;as soon as he sees you, he says &#x0027;that looks mightily like an <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs>.&#x0027; When you get a little nearer, &#x0027;that must surely be an <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs>.&#x0027; Still watching you, when you have crawled up almost within shot, &#x0027;I am certain that is an <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs>,&#x0027; Creeping farther, <q>&#x0027;If he comes much nearer, I shall be off.&#x0027;</q> But just then, bang goes the gun and down falls the deer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>With a turkey it is different.--The moment he sees anything which he cannot make out, he cries &#x0027;<rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs>,&#x0027; and is off like the wind.&#x0022;</q> Nevertheless, persons who understand turkey hunting, find it easy to exterminate a whole flock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>It is well known that they have particular ranges, and that they rarely, unless scattered, go beyond them.--Within these ranges, they travel many miles In a day. They must not be followed, for they cannot well be found in that way. The most experienced hunters have a dog trained to the business, who hunts them, and, rushing in among the flock, scatters them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>The huntsman then dismounts, places himself behind a tree or log, and yelps them up. In the fall, when they are young, this succeeds completely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>Later in the season they become more cautious, and are not easily brought within shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>Sometimes an old Gobler will answer the call, at a distance from the blind too great for a shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>If he is let alone, be will collect the whole flock around him, and then they will trot off, without taking leave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>In such a case, as soon as the sportsman finds what sort of a customer he has to deal with, he jumps up, fires off his gun, and thus produces a new scatteration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>Then he removes his blind and trusts to his yelping powers once more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>Yelpers are most commonly made of the bones of a turkey's wing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>Others are formed by driving a nail through a piece of wood hollowed like a bowl.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>The hand is held over the top of the hollow, so as to exclude the air, and a piece of slate is scratched with the nail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>The sound very much resembles the yelping of a turkey, and many have been killed by means of the contrivance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>The turkey has been called the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> <persName n="Buzzard,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00184" reg="mostcommon:Buzzard,nomatch:0"><surname>Buzzard</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>We never saw a bustard; but naturalists say that when seen against a clear horizon, of a cloudless evening, at a long distance, they have been mistaken for soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>The same mistake might be made with regard to a large flock of turkeys, under the same circumstances, so tall are they, and so stately and uniform are their movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>We hope a remnant will be left. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/> The wild goose is a bird which we spent a whole winter in hunting, when we were a boy. Their habits are well known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>They light in a wheat-field early in the morning, post sentinels with the regularity of a regiment on duty, and remain all day, if not disturbed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>It is a very hard matter to get a shot at them in the field, for they usually choose <num value="1">one</num> very large and open, so that they see all movements within the compass of several <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure>. Their sentinels face all points of the compass.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>and nothing escapes their observation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>The best way to get at them in the wheat-field is the stalking horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>Bridle a horse, walk by his side, gradually approach them, keeping the horse between you and them, walk around them, narrowing the circle continually, and you may get almost near enough to put salt on their tails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>This can be done only once, however, with the same flock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>They can never be deceived a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>On the contrary, after having been once tried in this way, they will fly if they see a horse <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a mile off. We tried this experiment once, and only once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>The day was rainy, and we had an old-fashioned, double-barreled, flint-lock gun. We got within <measure n="20yards" type="distance">twenty yards</measure> of a very large flock &mdash; we took a long and deliberate aim &mdash; we bargained for at least half a dozen &mdash; the powder in the pan flashed &mdash; the gun gave a hissing sound, as though it were deliberating about going off-- the geese rose, with a tremendous clamor, and when they were about <measure n="30feet" type="distance">thirty feet</measure> in the air &mdash; shu, slap, bash, bang &mdash; off it went.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>We confess we killed none that day, but we made the feathers fly. Off they went, sailing around and around again, and there we stood in the rain, trying to get off our <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> barrel, which varied a bad habit it had of snapping by only a single flash in the pan, that being the nearest approach it made to firing, on that occasion, at least. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/> The note of the wild goose is exceedingly musical to our ear. When a large flock cry altogether, there is what <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Shakespeare,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00185" reg="mostcommon:Shakespeare,nomatch:0"><surname>Shakespeare</surname></persName></hi> calls a musical discord in the chorus, that Is more enlivening than the cry of a full pack of hounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>During the time alluded to above, we lived near a number of rocks constituting the <rs type="place">Maiden's Adventure falls</rs>, on which the geese used to rest at night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>They came thither from all quarters of the country, within <measure n="50miles" type="distance">fifty miles</measure>. We have very often gone into the midst of the rocks, and waited for them until they came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/>In this way we killed several.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>A more experienced sportsman might have killed dozens of them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/> This is a rambling discourse, but it is a rambling subject, and we hope to be excused on that account. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/> We can easily believe that the most fraternal sentiments towards their countrymen of the <rs>South</rs>, and of every section, animate the officers of the <orgName n="Navy" type="military">Navy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>Many of them are Southern men, and all of them, with few exceptions, are gentlemen of an eminently national character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>They love the name of <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs>, and are proud of that beautiful flag, which has waved triumphantly upon every sea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>Moreover, individually and personally, the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> sailor is the most generous and sympathizing, as he is the most enterprising and heroic of men, and therefore we can easily understand that few of our naval officers, whatever their political ideas, view with composure the prospect of being employed to coerce any portion of their own countrymen into submission, with the award.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>Nor is this peculiar to the officers in our own service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>Even in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, accustomed as it is to bloody revolution and bloody oppression, the military chief recoils from the cruel necessity of bathing in the blood of his countrymen that award which was consecrated to their defence, and, no matter how necessary it may be, he is never able afterwards fully to efface the odium of the executioner's office, and write out from his shield that <q>&#x0022;damned spot.&#x0022;</q> </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1564"/> Although <placeName key="tgn,7011731" n="1.000 54" reg="switzerland">Switzerland</placeName> is famous, all the world over, for its lofty mountains, still, in foreign countries, many lads of my age, and in my station of life, may not exactly know that the <name>Jura</name> is a chain of mountains formed by several parallel chains which extend from <placeName reg="Basel,Basel-Stadt,Schweiz,Europe" key="tgn,7007269">Basle, in Switzerland</placeName>, quite up to <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> and a little way into it, running in the direction from northeast to southwest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1565"/>The length of the <name>Jura</name> is about <measure n="170miles" type="distance">one hundred and seventy miles</measure>, and its breadth from <num value="35">thirty-five</num> to <measure n="40miles" type="distance">forty miles</measure>. It contains a great number of deep valleys, and several mountains whose summits are very lofty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1566"/> I mention these dry details at the outset, in order that you may better understand what happened to me; for it is, in great measure, the difference of the height of the mountains which renders them more or less habitable.--The higher they are, the sharper is the cold there, the shorter is the summer, the scantier is the vegetation, and the earlier does the snow cover it. Some of these mountains are even so lofty that the snow on their tops is never entirely and completely melted, but remains in patches in the hollows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1567"/>Nevertheless, all the mountains of the <name>Jura</name> lose their upper garment of snow every year; some sort of herbage springs on the highest summits: at many points they are clothed with magnificent woods of beech, oak, and especially fire; whilst other parts afford excellent pasture-ground on which very fine cattle are reared, and particularly oxen, cows, and goats, Notwithstanding which, these beautiful mountains are scarcely habitable more than <measure n="5months" type="date">five months</measure> in the year, from <dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct> or <dateStruct><month>June</month></dateStruct> until the beginning of <dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1568"/> As soon as the snows are melted and the summits are clothed again with green, our villages, which are all built in the valleys or on the lower slopes, send their herds up the mountain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1569"/>This departure is quite a holiday; and yet we herdsmen have to spend the whole summer away from our families, leading a hard-working life, with many privations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1570"/>We live almost entirely on a milk-and-cheese diet, which we call by a general name, <hi rend="italics">language,</hi> having often nothing else to drink by way of a change but water from the spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1571"/>We spend our time in grazing our herds and in making those large and handsome cheeses which are known as Gruyere. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1572"/> Every herdsman has, up in the mountain, a chalet, which is a wretched place for human habitation, although mostly built of stone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1573"/>It is roofed with small deal planks called <foreign lang="fre"> <hi rend="italics">bordeaux;</hi></foreign> heavy stones, laid in rows upon them, press them down, and prevent the storms from stripping them off. The interior of a chalet is divided into <num value="3">three</num> apartments; a well-closed stable or cow-house, to lodge the cattle at night; a narrow and cool dairy, where the milk is kept in broad wooden bowls; and a kitchen, which also serves as a bedroom, where the herdsman not unfrequently sleeps on a bed of straw.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1574"/>The kitchen is furnished with a vast chimney, in which hangs an enormous caldron, for warming the milk and helping to convert it into cheese.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1575"/>As the chalet is our residence the whole summer long, we are obliged to store it with many little articles of necessity, to save having to go down to the valley to fetch them when wanted unexpectedly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1576"/> Our season hardly finishes before St. Denis's day, the <date value="10-09">9th of October.</date> We then quit the mountain, again making a holiday, delighted to return to cur families.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1577"/>But we do not lead an idle life in the village, any more than we did at the chalet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1578"/>We are accustomed to depend upon ourselves, and are obliged to turn our hands to everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1579"/>We make household utensils, tools, and furniture; we carve wood into fancy articles, which are afterwards dispersed all over <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1580"/>But, what is of the greatest importance, the winter allows us spare time for our education.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1581"/>If the path to the school is not always open, the children are made to learn their lessons at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1582"/>The art of writing is not forgotten; and by reading aloud, we amuse and instruct others as well as ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1583"/>It was a good thing for me that I was so brought up. If I had not had these resources in my trouble, I know not what would have become of me. <num value="1">One</num> thing at least is clear: the journal which follows could not have existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1584"/>Although only a Swiss country-lad, I have been able to write some sort of a history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1585"/>Here it is, as I was able to note it down from day to day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1586"/> <date value="11-22"><hi rend="italics">November</hi> 22.</date>--Since it is the will of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> that I and my grandfather should be imprisoned in this chalet, I intend to record in writing what happened to us. If we are destined to perish here, our relations and friends will learn how our last days were spent; if we are delivered, this journal will preserve the recollections of our dangers and our sufferings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1587"/>It is also my grandfather's wish that I should undertake it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1588"/> The day before yesterday, in the village, we had been expecting my father for several weeks past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1589"/>St. Denis's day was over; all the herds had come down from the mountain, together with their keepers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1590"/>My father alone failed to make his appearance, and we began to ask, <q>&#x0022;What can possibly detain him?&#x0022;</q> I lost my mother <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> ago; but my uncles and aunts assured me that I need not make myself uneasy; that probably there remained some grass to be eaten, and that was why my father kept the herd a little later up the mountain. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1591"/> At last my grandfather became alarmed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1592"/>He said, <q>&#x0022;I will go myself and see why <persName><foreName>Francois</foreName></persName> does not come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1593"/>I shall not be sorry to see the chalet once more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1594"/>Who knows whether I shall be able to visit it next summer?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1595"/>Will you like to come with me?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1596"/> It was the very request I was going to make; for, as I have no mother, we are almost always together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1597"/>We were soon ready to start.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1598"/>We mounted slowly, sometimes following narrow gorges, sometimes skirting the brink of deep precipices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1599"/>About <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a league before we came to the chalet, I was attracted by curiosity to the edge of a very steep rock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1600"/>My grandfather, who had told me more than once that he did not like my doing so, hastened forward to pull me back; but a large stone, rolling backwards as he stepped upon it, caused him to sprain his foot, and put him to considerable pain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1601"/>But in a few minutes he felt better, and we hoped that no bad consequences would ensue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1602"/>With the help of his stout holly stick, and by leaning on my shoulder, be was able to drag himself as far as this place. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1603"/> My father was greatly surprised to see <unclear></unclear> was busy preparing for him <unclear></unclear> that if we had quietly waited at home <unclear></unclear> longer, his arrival would have <unclear></unclear> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> <placeName key="tgn,2097195" n="1.000 10" reg="Fort Pierre, Stanley, South Dakota">Pierre</placeName> was to set off with the remainder of the cheeses. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1604"/> After a short repose, my grandfather asked me, <q>&#x0022;Are you very tired, <persName><foreName>Louis</foreName></persName>?&#x0022;</q> The manner in which he made the inquiry seemed to betray some secret intention, and I did not give a very decided answer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1605"/><q>&#x0022;I was thinking,&#x0022;</q> be added, <q>&#x0022;that it might be prudent to send on the boy with <persName><foreName>Pierre</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1606"/>The wind has changed during the last half-hour, and may perhaps bring us bad weather in the course of the night.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1607"/> My father expressed the same fear, and urged me to follow that counsel. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1608"/> <q>&#x0022;I had much rather wait for you,&#x0022;</q> I said.--<q>&#x0022;Grandfather, with his lame foot, stands in great need of a good night's rest.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1609"/> There hung over the fire a boiler which I regarded with greedy eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1610"/>My father understood the signal, and served us some soup made of maize-flour and milk, which we ate, like soldiers, all out of <num value="1">one</num> bowl.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1611"/>It was agreed that we should all go down together next day, which was yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1612"/>After which I went to bed and fell asleep, without paying much attention to what was said by my father and grandfather, who had a long conversation in an under take after their supper. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1613"/> Next morning I was quite surprised to see the mountain all covered with white.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1614"/>The snow was still falling with unusual heaviness, being driven by a violent wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1615"/>I should have been highly amused, had I not remarked my relations' anxiety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1616"/>I was very uneasy myself, when I saw my grandfather try to take a few steps, and drag himself along with great difficulty, supporting himself by the furniture and against the wall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1617"/>The accident of the day before had caused his foot to swell, and made it very painful. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1618"/> &#x0022;Go,&#x0022; he said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1619"/><q>&#x0022;Lead away the child, before the snow is deeper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1620"/>You see it is impossible for me to accompany you.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1621"/> <q>&#x0022;But do you suppose, father, I can abandon you in that way?&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1622"/> We spent a good portion of the day without coming to a decision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1623"/>We had still hopes that assistance would be sent to us from the village.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1624"/>I said that I was big enough to do without a guide, and to help my father to drive the herd.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1625"/>My representations were of no use; my grandfather persisted in his resolution.--He would not expose us to danger, by becoming a burden on us. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1626"/> My father insisted, almost angrily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1627"/>I wept while I witnessed the painful altercation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1628"/>At last <num value="1">1</num> contrived to put an end to it, by saying, <q>&#x0022;Leave me also in the chalet; you will reach home all the sooner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1629"/>You will come back with sufficient help to fetch us. Grandfather will have somebody to wait upon him and keep him company.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1630"/>We shall take care of <num value="1">one</num> another, and <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> will take care of us both.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1631"/> <q>&#x0022;The boy is right,&#x0022;</q> my grandfather said.--<q>&#x0022;The snow is already so deep, and the storm so violent, that I apprehend more danger from his following you than from his staying with me. Here, <persName><foreName>Francois</foreName></persName>, take my stick, it is a strong <num value="1">one</num> and pointed with iron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1632"/>It will help you down the mountain, as it helped me up. Let the cows out of the stable; leave us the goat and all the provisions which remain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1633"/>I am more anxious about you than I am about myself.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1634"/> When my father was on the point of starting, I gave him a handsome flask covered with fine wicker-work, which was a present from my mother, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time I came up to the chalet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1635"/>It contained wine which I had provided for my grandfather the day before.--He pressed me in his arms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1636"/> We drove out the herd, which appeared much surprised to find the earth covered with snow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1637"/>Some of the cows seemed at a loss to find their way, and kept running in circles round the chalet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1638"/>At last they congregated in a body, and set off in the right direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1639"/>At a very few paces' distance both my father and the herd disappeared, being lost to sight in the whirls of snow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1640"/>When we saw them no longer, my grandfather appeared to follow them with his eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1641"/>He leaned in silence against the window, but his lips appeared to be articulating words; his hands were clasped and his eyes raised to heaven. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1642"/> We were roused from serious thoughts by the increasing violence of the wind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1643"/>We were wrapped round by a curtain of thick black clouds, and nightfall came almost suddenly.-- Nevertheless, our wooden clock had only just struck <num value="3">three</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1644"/>We had been so anxious all day long, that we had never thought of taking food, and I was dying of hunger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1645"/>At that moment, I made grandfather listen how the goat was bleating. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1646"/> <q>&#x0022;Poor Blanchette!&#x0022;</q> he said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1647"/><q>&#x0022;She wants to be relieved of her milk.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1648"/>She is calling us to come and do it. Light the lamp; we will go and milk her, and then we will sup.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1649"/> The wind roared loudly; it forced its way under the bordeaux of the roof, making them rattle; you would have fancied the whole roof was going to be carried away. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1650"/> <q>&#x0022;Don't be alarmed,&#x0022;</q> my grandfather said.--<q>&#x0022;This house has resisted many a like attack.--The bordeaux are laden with very heavy stones, and the roof, with its slight inclination, gives very little hold to the wind.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1651"/> When the goat saw us she redoubled her bleatings; she seemed as if she would break her rope to get at us. How greedily she licked the few grains of salt which I offered in my hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1652"/>She gave us a large pot of milk, I stood in need of it. My grandfather said, as we returned to the kitchen, <q>&#x0022;We must take good care not to forget Blanchette; we must feed her well, and milk her punctually morning and evening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1653"/>Our life depends on hers.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1654"/> After supper, we sat down by the fire; but the flakes of snow which fell down the chimney almost extinguished it. A cold draught of air also descended, and we could only keep ourselves warm by going to bed, after commending ourselves, by prayer, to the <rs>Lord</rs>'s protection. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1655"/> This morning, on waking, I found myself in complete darkness, and at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> supposed that sleep had left me earlier than usual; but hearing my grandfather groping his way about the room, I rubbed my eyes, and saw none the clearer for that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1656"/>The snow had blocked up the window. </p>
