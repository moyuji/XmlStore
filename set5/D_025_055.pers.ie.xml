<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/> What any of these people accomplished we are capable of accomplishing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>With us, in addition to all this, everything precious to the human affections, everything sacred to the human heart, is at issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>I know no language which in that case, could adequately paint the depth of our degradation and extremity of our wretchedness, unless it be those burning lines of an English poet, in which he gave vent to his feelings of horror and indignation when deprecating the iron rule of a vulgar and hypocritical tyranny in his own land: </p>

<p> In the foregoing remarks, it has been assumed that the enemy's forces were, in number, much greater than ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>This has, undoubtedly, heretofore been the fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>But I am firmly persuaded that, notwithstanding the immense difference in the actual population of the <num value="2">two</num> countries, we shall hence forward have an army in the field at all times fully equal in numbers to theirs; and that surely, is all we need desire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>The energies of the <rs>South</rs> are just beginning to be thoroughly aroused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>We already see a proposition in the <name>Legislature</name> of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName> to extend the limits of the military age below <measure n="18years" type="date">eighteen years</measure> to <num value="16">sixteen</num>, and above <num value="45">forty-five</num> to <num value="60">sixty</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>But our circumstances may well justify a recurrence to the ancient rule, so far, at least, as to call out the supplementary classes for local defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>The spirit of the people, there can be no doubt, would nobly respond to such a call, while the demands of the crisis, appealing to the instinctive courage of men, and enforced by the pleading loveliness of woman, will keep our active army full within the limits of the age heretofore prescribed for it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/> The situation of our adversary presents a very different picture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>The popular fervor for the war, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> kindled, and for some time kept up by delusive pretexts, is abated and abating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>The difficulties and general repugnance opposed to their recent draft have converted it into very little more than a barren mockery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>No large accessions to their army, already much reduced by the expiration of enlistments and casualties of war, can now be had by force or by persuasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>The cordial support of public opinion, in the present age of the world, is indispensable to the effective prosecution of every war. Great as has been the amount of prejudice and delusion and bad feeling among the people of the <rs>North</rs> towards us, happily &#x0022;reason has not fled to brutish breasts.&#x0022; Many of them now see that the present war is, almost without disguise, a war for the extermination or degradation of the white race by the installation of the blacks in virtual dominion over them, and in such a war they have no motive of sympathy or interest to engage them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>Others, profiting, at last, of the sagacious lessons of <placeName reg="Chatham, Kent, England" key="tgn,7011586">Chatham</placeName>, <persName n="Burke,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00067" reg="mostcommon:Burke,nomatch:0"><surname>Burke</surname></persName>, <rs n="Fox" type="nativeamerican">Fox</rs>, and that noble band of patriots and <sic>statesmen</sic> in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> who manfully opposed the war upon the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Colonies from the start, begin to see that the triumph of lawless despotism over the independence of the <rs>South</rs> would be equally fatal to their remnant of constitutional liberty at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>From the operation of these and other causes the military, with the moral strength of the <rs>North</rs> in this contest, will go on decreasing, while ours will as certainly increase. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/> On whatever side I look, then, I see no omen of discouragement, but, on the contrary, new grounds of assurance, with regard to the ultimate and certain triumph of the great cause in which we are embarked.

<p rend="nobreak">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/> --Greatly to our astonishment, on a visit to the country lately, we found many persons of whom we had expected better things, disposed to take a gloomy view of our present condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>What there is in it to justify even a shade of despondency we are unable to perceive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>But so it is. A number of farmers, taking their cue apparently from the croakers around and within this city, have become depressed, and, what is the worst feature of the case, communicate their fears to their neighbors. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/> To all such persons we recommend the perusal and reprisal of the powerful letter of <persName n="Rives,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00128" reg="nearbymention:Rives,W.,C.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Rives</surname></persName>, which we republish this morning from the <orgName n="Richmond Whig" type="newspaper">Richmond <hi rend="italics">Whig</hi></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>It is the production of a man who is, like themselves, a farmer, and who is probably the wisest and best informed of their class &mdash; who has been noted all his life for the moderation of his views and the calmness of his temper &mdash; who is of an age when enthusiasm is not apt to lead the judgment astray, and of an experience which enables him to distinguish between the false glare of fallacious dreams and the steady light of well-founded hope &mdash; who has thoroughly studied the whole question and made himself master of all its details &mdash; and who, therefore, is competent to give a reason for the hope that is in him. We ask the farmer in whom is it most proper that he should repose his confidence?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>In such a man as we have described <persName n="Rives,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00129" reg="nearbymention:Rives,W.,C.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Rives</surname></persName> to be, and as everybody knows he is, or in his timid neighbor, who is alarmed by every breeze that sweeps by him from the <rs>South</rs>, and cannot rest contented until he has made everybody around him as wretched and as despondent as himself? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/> What is there in our situation to make any man despond?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>We have gained, since this war commenced, the most astonishing series of victories ever obtained by a people similarly situated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>We have made a name among the people of the earth in <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> such as scarcely any other people ever made in <measure n="3centuries" type="date">three centuries</measure>. We have already fought more battles and gained more victories than <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> has done since the days of <persName n="Clive,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00130" reg="mostcommon:Clive,nomatch:0"><surname>Clive</surname></persName>, although within the period which produced <persName n="Clive,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00131" reg="mostcommon:Clive,nomatch:0"><surname>Clive</surname></persName> and the present time the whole of <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName> has been overrun and conquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>We have done all this, and have lost <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>Even though the enemy had obtained the free navigation of the river by the fall of that place, the blow would not be irremediable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>Nor would it be should <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, <placeName reg="Savannah, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101410">Savannah</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName> fall along with it. When they shall have made all these conquests their labor will have but begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/> --Unless a different system from that now in operation be adopted, this most useful, indeed indispensable, arm of the service seems in a fair way to be broken up entirely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>At present each man furnishes his own horse, and is allowed <measure n="40cents" type="currency">forty cents</measure> a day for keeping him. <measure n="40cents" type="currency">Forty cents</measure> a day make <measure n="146dollars" type="currency">one hundred and forty-six dollars</measure> a year &mdash; that is to say, about <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> part of the sum which it costs to obtain a good, serviceable (not a fine) horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>The cavalry service is very hard upon the horses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>Forage is frequently scarce, and the horses very often compelled to put up with the scantiest possible fare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>Moreover, they are required to be constantly in motion, often after a shoe, or it may be <num value="2">two</num>, has been lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>Under these circumstances it is not wonderful that the destruction of horse flesh is enormous, and troopers often dismounted, and compelled probably for days to follow the wagon trains, rendering no service in their proper sphere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>The Government pays for no horses but such as are killed in battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>When the trooper loses his horse he is compelled to buy another out of his own purse, and as not many of them are rich, it goes peculiarly hard with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>Few of them are able to stand a repetition of the process, now that the most ordinary horse sells for <num value="5">five</num> or <measure n="600dollars" type="currency">six hundred dollars</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/> Government ought to furnish horses to the cavalry, as they furnish swords and pistols.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>The idea is that the trooper will take better care of the horse if it belong to him than he would if it belonged to the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>There may be something in this notion, but the evils of the present system are so enormous as greatly to counterbalance this single good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>It is, moreover, the duty of the officers to see that the horses are properly taken care of, and no officer is fit to command who does not attend to this duty with the utmost particularity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>In every other service, we believe, Government owns the horses, and the men are made to take proper care of them, being liable to severe punishment for failure to do so. Why cannot our cavalry be placed on the same footing with that of other services?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>We hope Congress will take up this question and apply the proper remedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>Otherwise, we see not how it is possible to prevent the dismounting of large bodies of mounted troops. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
