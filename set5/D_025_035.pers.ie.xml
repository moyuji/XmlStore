<head>War inevitable.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> It may be some consolation to a people groaning under the calamities of war to bear in mind that the evil which they endure is <num value="1">one</num> from which their race has never been exempt, and which is as inevitable as suffering and death in any other form.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>What nation is there which has escaped the scourge of war?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Search the records of ancient and modern times, explore the whole habitable area of our planet, and name <num value="1">one</num> country, discover <num value="1">one</num> rood of earth, which has not been visited by this desolating scourge!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Like plague, pestilence, and famine, war is a scourge from which fallen humanity never has escaped and never will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Why should the people of this continent expect exemption from the common curse of mankind?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>It is only in the <name>Millennium</name> that the <name>Scriptures</name> have taught us to look for the conversion of the sword into the plough share and the spear into the pruning hook.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>But we seem to think that <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> was entitled to a Millennium of its own, independent of the rest of the world, and consider it a peculiar grievance that whilst every nation of our fallen race has been punished in this way for its sins we should escape it altogether, for no better reason than that we have been mercifully spared it for the last <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> There are those who say that if the <rs>Union</rs> had not been dissolved there would have been no war, but if that were true, the <name>Millennium</name> would have been established in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> and nowhere else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>For it was a part of the manifest destiny announced by Northern politicians that we should go on annexing other countries, and visiting them with the sword, whilst we ourselves sit in peace beneath our own vine and fig tree!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> does not permit such injustice and inequality as that in his dominions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Moreover the <rs>Union</rs> could not have been preserved, unless the disposition to abuse power on the <num value="1">one</num> hand, and the spirit of manly resistance on the other, had died out from the hearts of men. To these principles may be traced most of the wars which have convulsed society, and these, sooner or later, rendered the violent dismemberment of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>It was impossible to accede to the demands of the party which has overthrown the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">United States Constitution</rs> without such a surrender of manhood and self-respect as to the honor of humanity is rare in its annals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>We must submit to war as a thing that is inevitable; that cannot be escaped by living in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> any more than sorrow and death in any other shape, and console ourselves with reflecting that this great evil was forced upon us against our most earnest prayers and struggles for peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>We have only asked to be let alone; we have stood upon the defensive; we are hunted and shot down in our own fields and at our own firesides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The same has happened to our unhappy race in every age and every clime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Shall we meet our tribulations like men and Christians, or whine like spoiled children because an All wise Father commends to our lips the same bitter chalice which our brethren have drank in all generations? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> To speak of no other nation, <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> alone, our mother country, besides her various civil convulsions and wars with other empires, has had, within a period of <measure n="700years" type="date">seven hundred years</measure>, <hi rend="italics"><measure n="266years" type="date">two hundred and sixty-six years</measure> of desolating war</hi> with <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Some of these wars lasted <num value="20">twenty</num>, <num value="30">thirty</num>, <num value="40">forty</num>, and <num value="1">one</num> over <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure>. The fate of the <rs>Continental</rs> nations has been even worse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>Was the <rs>Western Hemisphere</rs> a part and parcel of Heaven, that we were to expect in it perpetual peace?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>It is not enough to emigrate from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> to <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> to escape war; in order to accomplish that, man must emigrate from himself. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> The Wars of the <name>Roses</name> in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, &#x0022;ate out,&#x0022; as the <orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName> expresses it, &#x0022;the heart of a century.&#x0022; The Reformation found belligerent employment for a whole generation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The Civil War, from the raising of the standard at <placeName reg="Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, England" key="tgn,7012006">Nottingham</placeName> to the final reduction of <placeName reg="Scotland" key="tgn,7002444">Scotland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Eire" key="tgn,7001181">Ireland</placeName>, lasted <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure>. It matters not what the form of Government &mdash; whether despotism, constitutional monarchy, or republicanism,--the earth has no covert or shelter from war, except the grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>There alone &#x0022;the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> The <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> <rs n="Unionist" type="political">Unionists</rs> would build up in a colossal Union another <persName n="Tower,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00004" reg="mostcommon:Tower,nomatch:0"><surname>Tower</surname></persName> of Babel against which the floods and storms of War should beat in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Idle, impracticable enterprise!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> has but to utter his voice, and there is a dispersion of the tribes, leaving <num value="0.5">a half</num> finished monument to attest the weakness and the misery of man. The very magnitude of the project was the source of its failure.--For, as has been already shown in this paper, it is impossible to hold together immense territories having conflicting sectional and social interests and feelings, and inhabited by populous and civilized communities, by any means short of despotic force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Unless the people become as degenerate as the cohesive power is despotic, resistance and disintegration are inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The Old World is full of illustrations of the fact, and the history of the Old World is now repeating itself in the <rs>New</rs>. In whatever light, therefore, we look at it, we must reverently recognize the hand of <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>We must submit to this infliction as we do to Plague and Pestilence, which, in <num value="1">one</num> respect, are lighter evils, because they cannot be resisted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>But this invasion, cruel and bloody as it is, we may rob of its crowning agony, our subjugation, if we but meet it in the spirit of men and Christians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Let us learn to prefer death to degradation, and we shall convert an inevitable evil into the source of security and happiness to ourselves and our posterity. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/> The vast expectations which have been built upon the events of the past few weeks in the <rs>Southwest</rs> will now receive the test of fulfillment or non fulfillment.--The opening of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> has been looked forward to as the consummation of all the hopes of Western men. With that great artery of commerce once more navigable, the old prosperity was to have returned, and the blessings of peace were to have fallen upon us as plentifully as rain drops in a summer shower.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>It is now in the possession of the <rs>North</rs>, from its source to the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs>, and what are the prospects?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>We have <measure n="1400miles" type="distance">fourteen hundred miles</measure> of navigable water in an enemy's territory, which we must guard with a constant patrol of gunboats in order to secure the most remote possibility of safety, either of property or life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>These patrol boats can command all permanent obstructions, such as fixed batteries, but the guerilla detachments which fly hither and thither with light field guns, appearing suddenly on the river bank and riddling or capturing a passing boat, and then scampering off to inaccessible swamps and bayous, they cannot control.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>There will hence be no safety, and merchants will find the investment a hazardous <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>Cotton buyers, it is true, will keep up their traffic, for they have become accustomed to hazards, and know well that he who risks nothing makes nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>Ordinary merchants cannot find a profitable market for their goods in an honest way, because they are forbidden to trade with the rebels, and there are no others, unless we except New Orleans, which receive supplies from New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>We have, in point of fact, been as well prepared for legitimate trade ever since the river was opened to <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName> as now. The trade has been confined to such stocks as were needed to furnish the city, and such other stocks as were smuggled through to the rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>So it will be lower down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>The towns occupied by our troops will be replenished, and through them a great quantity of articles will go to the rebels, but all this is outside the pale of legitimate trade, and the majority of merchants will not engage in it. The keen-visaged, hook nosed speculators who swarm up and down the river will do the business, and <persName><roleName n="Uncle">Uncle</roleName> <foreName>Sam</foreName></persName> may look sharply after them, for they will turn a penny wherever the opportunity offers.-- </p> </q><bibl n="Chicago Times"></bibl></cit> <milestone unit="column" n="5"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>That there is already no lack of them the reader may well believe, but that there will be more, none need doubt, for they are created with the occasion, and come as naturally to hand as any of the other peculiar products of war times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>The reply is eminently characteristic of the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>He consents to plead before the committee, as if they had placed him on trial, which virtually they did, and justifies an action which he admits to be extraordinary and unconstitutional on the sole plea of a necessity of which he is the sole judge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>They wound up by declining his propositions, and throwing upon him the responsibility before the public and the world's opinion &mdash; a responsibility which they declare to be aggravated by an intimation in his extraordinary letter that he will, if ever he sees it in the public interests, repeat the illegal acts of which the committee complained.
