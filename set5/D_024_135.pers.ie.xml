<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The heroic garrison has immortalized itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> give up the attempt to take the city by storm, and now talk of a regular siege &mdash; a plan which <persName n="Johnston,General,Joe,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="default:Johnston,Joe,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Joe</foreName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> may possibly interfere with. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>Therefore, in behalf of the Union-loving and law abiding citizens of this State, we repel and denounce the slavish, cowardly, and despotic principles thus put forth by a political assemblage, which appropriately assumes the &#x0022;loyal&#x0022; designation under which the tories of the <name>Revolution</name> proclaimed their unconditional support of the <rs>King</rs> of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>And we charge that many of the active agents in getting up said meeting were influenced by pecuniary and personal interests, in contracts, office, and stocks. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/> <hi rend="italics">Resolved,</hi> That not only the disorganizing principles avowed by the retainers of the <name>Administration</name>, but the arbitrary acts of its subordinates, are calculated to inspire the friends of constitutional government throughout the world with alarm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>The dispersal of conventions of the people by armed force, the suppression of public journals, the arrest of civilians and clergymen for opinions uttered in the forum and the pulpit, and their cruel and unusual punishment, the coercion and falsification of the votes of soldiers, the public removal, with opprobrious stigma, of an officer of a <orgName type="mil" key="NHRegiment">New Hampshire regiment</orgName> for the offence of voting the <rs>Democratic</rs> ticket are acts which run through the whole code of despotic systems, and turn the guarantees of constitutional liberty into a mockery and a snare. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/> <hi rend="italics">Resolved,</hi> That while we do not object to the rightful exercise of military law within the lines of warlike operations, or awed the scenes of insurrectionary strice, we maintain that beyond these limits the civil law is supreme, and that those who seek to prostrate it by force of arms are traitors to the country and the <rs>Constitution</rs>. </p>
