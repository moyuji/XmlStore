<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> The weather here is very stormy, and judging from appearances and the direction of the wind, we shall probably have another storm, which will be specially annoying to the transient visitors to <placeName key="tgn,3000601" n="1.000 10" reg="cape hatteras, dare, north carolina">Hatteras</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>I learn that during the storm that occurred some <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> ago, the cowardly <rs n="Hessian" type="ethnic">Hessian</rs> troops there were nearly washed away, the tide rising several feet over the low and narrow piece of sandy land which they are holding in terrible suspense, until they shall be captured by the dauntless Southerners who are determined to drive them from the sod of the <orgName n="Old North State" type="newspaper">Old North State</orgName> as soon as they are ready to strike a blow that will teach the intruders a lesson never to be forgotten. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> I learn that the soldier who was so severely wounded a few days ago by balls fired from a revolver by an officer, has died; but as I have no direct information from the hospital to which he was taken, the report may not be true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>I believe it is generally conceded here that the shooting was justifiable in this affair, and may be regarded as a case of self-defence, as it is thought the unfortunate man would have made a desperate assault with his bowie knife had he not been so promptly disabled. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> Much concern is felt here about the scarcity of coal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The supply of anthracite having been exhausted some time since, and transporting bituminous coal here from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> or <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName> is attended with considerable expense; besides, the grates and stoves are mostly adapted to the burning of hard coal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Soft coal, as it is called, is selling here at 35a37<measure n=".5cents" type="currency">&#x00BD; cents</measure>. <persName n="Wood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Wood,Robert,,,:1"><surname>Wood</surname></persName>, however, is plentiful &mdash; standing in the forests, if not for sale on the docks; and although the article is rather high, there needs be no great fear that our people will suffer from cold on account of the want of fuel. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> The Independent Grays, of this city, express their sincere thanks to the ladies of the <rs>Episcopal</rs> <orgName n="Soldiers Aid Society" type="society">Soldiers' Aid Society</orgName>, for a much-needed supply of blankets and many other favors unexpected and unsolicited, and <q>&#x0022;bestowed so quietly and with such grace as to make them as forgetful as possible of their indebtedness.&#x0022;</q> In their card of thanks, the <rs>Gray</rs>'s very appropriately add: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> &#x0022;An untold amount of clothing has been made up by them for our volunteers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The sick have been visited and studiously cared for &mdash; all who were in need and have made known their wants, have been provided with every nourishment and comfort that home could afford &mdash; in fact, everything that the greatest exertions could do has been done; and, in return, we can only say that these benefits shall be enshrined in our memory, and if even we are blessed with an opportunity to cope with our implacable and ruthless enemy, and to protect our good friends, we shall then give sure and unmistakable evidence of our gratitude.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="The Gray"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> Verily, the efforts and valuable assistance rendered by the ladies of the <rs>South</rs> in behalf of those who are battling for liberty cannot be over-estimated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Their labors, personally and assidously, for the comfort of the soldiers, their words of encouragement, and the genial influence of their smiles upon our brave troops, in their struggles in the holy and righteous cause of freedom, will form many a thrilling chapter in the history of the present war, and descend far down the track of time, to be remembered by generations to come, to live in song wherever the voice of civilization shall be heard, or deeds of love, mercy, and heroism shall receive the award of merit and praise by the enlightened, the good, and the brave. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> A flag of truce came up yesterday from <placeName reg="Old Point, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2557597">Old Point</placeName>, and probably no other communication will be had between our city and <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 64" reg="fortress monroe, hampton, virginia">Fort Monroe</placeName> for some time to come. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> War matters are unusually quiet hereabouts at this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The discharge of great guns is but seldom heard, and all the preparations for conflict are going on with but little noise or excitement. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> There are some rumors here of extraordinary arrangements and extensive preparations going on at the <rs>North</rs> for the hopeless work of subjugating a great nation, such as building ships, collecting troops, concentrating forces, provisions, equipments, horses, &#x0026;c., &#x0026;c. Meanwhile, the indomitable and vigilant men of the <rs>South</rs>, here and elsewhere, are getting ready for any emergency or any attempt of the enemies of liberty and civilization to carry out their iniquitous designs upon those who only desire an honorable and peaceful separation, and the enjoyment of those rights and privileges to which they have asserted a just and well-established claim. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The gentlemen who arrived here on Saturday were solely prompted to the voyage, which they have so successfully accomplished, by the desire to do what so many had talked of, and which was pronounced an impossible journey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>At present considerable bets are pending in <placeName key="tgn,2067213" n="1.000 6" reg="mesilla, dona ana county, new mexico">Mesilla</placeName> on the result of the undertaking, and many promises of reward will have to be fulfilled by the public-spirited citizens of that place towards the successful voyagers. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Thus fitted out, the party started upon their novel trip.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>They floated along with the current, using the paddles but little, and directing the course of their raft with a rudder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>They travelled during the day only, always making fast to the shore and camping on terra firma at night to avoid accidents in the river. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/> It is unnecessary to specify examples from the wars of the <rs>French Revolution</rs>; the whole history of these wars is <num value="1">one</num> continued proof of the superiority of fortifications as a maritime frontier defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The <name>French</name> navy was at this time utterly incompetent to their defence, while <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> supported a maritime force at an annual expense of near <hi rend="italics"><num value="90000000">ninety millions</num> of dollars.</hi> Her largest fleets were continually cruising within sight of these seaports, and not unfrequently attempting to cut out their shipping.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>Sitting around the fire an officer read a letter from home which said that flannel was scarce, and very dear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>Considering this, the ladies, who would remain in the warm <rs>South</rs>, had determined to cut up their flannel skirts to make warm shirts for their <q>&#x0022;dear boys&#x0022;</q> in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.
