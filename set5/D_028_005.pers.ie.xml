<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>He tells <persName n="Wheeler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Wheeler,nomatch:0"><surname>Wheeler</surname></persName> that, according to the statement of <persName n="Brown,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Brown,James,,,:1"><roleName n="Governor">Governor</roleName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>, his own (<persName n="Wheeler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Wheeler,nomatch:0"><surname>Wheeler</surname></persName>'s) soldiers have been in the habit of depredating upon the families of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, and that he cannot expect his (<persName n="Kilpatrick,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Kilpatrick,nomatch:0"><surname>Kilpatrick</surname></persName>'s) men to behave any better, being avowed enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>In the opinion of this <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> General, then, <num value="2">two</num> wrongs make a right, and because a man has been cuffed by a friend, an enemy has a perfect right to murder him outright.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The morality of this conclusion is peculiarly <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>, and such as was to have been expected from a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Because a Confederate regiment burns a citizen's fence, or steals his turnips and potatoes, a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> regiment is justifiable in burning all the houses, mills, barns and provisions in his neighborhood, besides violating the females and beating and murdering the old men and children. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The war which the people of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> were made to feel is more terrible than the war which the <rs n="Cherokee" type="nativeamerican">Cherokees</rs> and <rs n="Seminole" type="nativeamerican">Seminole</rs> waged in bygone days.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Murder and conflagration have been the principal weapons with which it was fought, and by means of these weapons the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have sought to do that which they have become aware they cannot do by fair fighting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>We know of no man so well qualified to lecture on the horrors of war as a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> brigand transformed into a major-general. &#x0022;Had the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>,&#x0022; (continues this plundering emissary of the &#x0022;best government on earth,&#x0022;) &#x0022;and especially those of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, ever known and felt what the people of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> now know and <sic>feeel,</sic> no hostile shot would ever have struck the sacred walls of <placeName key="tgn,2096786" n="1.000 14" reg="sumter, sumter, south carolina">Sumter</placeName>.&#x0022; He is mistaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, including the people of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, knew well enough that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were not more than half civilized, and that they would wage the war like barbarians long before they began it. They have not been disappointed in a single instance, because they expected nothing but such treatment as captives receive from brigands; and, whenever they have fallen into the hands of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, they have received it. They are well aware, too, that no country was ever conquered by any such process as this, and <persName n="Kilpatrick,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Kilpatrick,nomatch:0"><surname>Kilpatrick</surname></persName>, were he anything else than the brigand he is, would know it too. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>He indignantly repels the insinuation that his soldiers had been allowed to depredate on the inhabitants. &#x0022;They have been taught,&#x0022; he says, &#x0022;to despise and spurn the cowardly instincts which induce low men to frighten, abuse and rob defenseless women and children&#x0022;; and, he adds, &#x0022;the history of no war, however bar- <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> barous, can tell of atrocities equal to those daily and hourly committed by your troops.&#x0022; </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> It was not alone the splendid courage of <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> which attracted the eyes of the world, for courage in the <rs>Confederacy</rs> is as common as among the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Romans</rs> of the <rs>Republic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The coward is the exception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/><num value="99">Ninety-nine</num> out of every <num value="100">hundred</num> of the <orgName n="Stonewall Brigade" type="brigade">Stonewall Brigade</orgName> were worthy in this quality of their leader.--It was not the evidences of his superior military ability alone, great as that undoubtedly was; but it was the combination of genius in his profession, with tremendous <hi rend="italics">energy,</hi> a quality which is to a soldier what &#x0022;action, action, action,&#x0022;is to an orator, that composed the broad foundations of his fame.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Nor was this all. The <rs>English</rs>, who are pre-eminently a nation of methodical industry, and who have attained their present greatness by being so, were delighted to find in this illustrious warrior a man who was not afraid to work, who gave as systematic and patient attention to the details of duty as to the operations of the battle-field, and who neither lost a battle nor lost a wagon train.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>It is a fact, that if any <num value="1">one</num> wanted to find <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, he was as likely to find him among his wagons as anywhere else, and that the loss of a few old wagons, which, on <num value="1">one</num> occasion, got stalled in crossing the <rs>Potomac</rs>, and which, we understand, were the only wagons he ever lost, gave him a distress which, according to the account of an eye-witness, was almost ludicrous. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> The <rs>English</rs> saw at a glance what this man was made of; that he was no dashing soldier of buttons and embroidery, of fuss and feathers; that he was, on the contrary, a thoroughly sincere and honest man, not thinking of himself, but of the business he had in hand, and that, in going about that business, he was as prompt, persistent and practical as he was skillful and courageous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>If anything was to be done by <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> it must be done at once, and done in a workmanlike manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Whilst his grand figure occupied the foreground in the public eye, it occupied the background in his own. If his name shall survive that of his country, it will be because she had so few such humble and laborious servants; few who, like him, were not only ready to sacrifice their lives, but their ease and all thoughts of self upon her altar. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> Would that the spirit of <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> might live among all our military aspirants!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>In his courage, great as it was, he has had many equals, but in his forethought, his practicalness, his rapidity, how few!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>There is a good deal too much talk about cavaliers, and chivalry, and all that.--<orgName n="Common Sense" type="newspaper">Common sense</orgName> and hard work are the things needed now. <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Stonewall,,,"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> understood the enemy we are dealing with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>He knew their patient, pains-taking, indefatigable habits of labor, and that these must triumph in the end unless met by corresponding qualities on our part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>He has left us a memorable example of those qualities, as well as of the skill, daring and energy of a great soldier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> Our <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName> correspondent states that an English officer who was with <persName n="Napier,Sir,Charles,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="default:Napier,Charles,,,"><roleName n="Sir">Sir</roleName> <foreName>Charles</foreName> <surname>Napier</surname></persName> in the <rs>Baltic</rs>, and who was also at <placeName reg="Sebastopol, Luzerne, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2650582">Sebastopol</placeName>, says that the fire of the <orgName n="Federal Fleet" type="fleet">Federal fleet</orgName> upon <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName> on the <dateStruct value="--24"><day reg="24">24th ultimo</day></dateStruct> exceeded anything he <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> had ever seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>If all our fortifications had been in such hands, the <rs>Confederacy</rs> would be spared many a humiliating page in its history. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> If anything is now clearly demonstrated by the progress of this war, it is that ships are no match for forts properly constructed and defended with determination.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>The <rs>New-Year</rs>'s dinner has come and gone; or, rather, gone without coming.--Some of the troops from the <rs>South</rs> seem to apprehend the <rs>Virginia</rs> troops, being nearer home, may have gotten the best of them in the distribution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>I think that, by stating the case of our regiment (the <orgName type="regiment" key="VA1">First Virginia</orgName>, and enlisted in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>,) this misapprehension may be relieved. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/> I presume <num value="1000">thousands</num> of rebels, like myself, expected really a good treat to the inner man, and plenty of it, basing their expectations upon the colossal preparations in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, the great number of Confederate dollars contributed by worthy and patriotic citizens, the glaring articles in the newspapers, and the names of the gentlemen who composed the committee, satisfied all of them that it would be a good thing; and, laboring under these impressions, we prepared accordingly, setting our incisors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>The quartermaster and commissary were to have nothing to do with the sumptuous feast, nor were they invited to partake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>Well, on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> notice was received at regiment headquarters to send a detail of men, with an officer, to brigade headquarters to receive our quota.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>[None of the committee have, as yet, made their appearance.] They soon returned with <measure n="2barrels" type="mass">two barrels</measure>, holding the dinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>The contents were soon made visible by knocking in the heads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>I will give you a list of the contents for the entire regiment, numbering <num value="260">two hundred and sixty</num> men and officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/><num value="32">Thirty-two</num> ordinary-size loaves of bread; <num value="2">two</num> turkeys, <num value="1">one</num> of them a very diminutive specimen of that species of fowl, (some swore that it was a chicken); <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of lamb and a horse-bucketful of apple butter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>Well, of course this immense weight of provender had to be divided out to the various companies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>After our company had received its due proportion, the whole lot was, by unanimous consent of the company, (numbering <num value="30">thirty</num> men,) condensed into <num value="6">six</num> parts, and by a species of lottery, all <num value="30">thirty</num> participating, the <num value="6">six</num> &#x0022;piles&#x0022; fell to <num value="6">six</num> men; so <num value="24">twenty-four</num> received <hi rend="italics">nothing,</hi> and <num value="6">six</num> <hi rend="italics">all.</hi> I was on picket at the time, but found, upon my return to camp, that I was <num value="1">one</num> of the successful <num value="6">six</num>, and got the leg of a turkey and <num value="0.5">a half</num>-pound of mutton, which I soon disposed of, with some fried bacon, red pepper, salt, water, and flour to thicken, making a French dish, which I leave for you to name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>So ended our New-Year's dinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>No blame is attached to any <num value="1">one</num>.
