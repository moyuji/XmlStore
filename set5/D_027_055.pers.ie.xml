<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> Everything continues quiet in front of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The enemy, after fiercely shelling the city on <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>, throwing missiles at times at the rate of <num value="100">one hundred</num> per hour, suddenly calmed down on <dateStruct><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct>, and during the whole day not a single shell annoyed the inhabitants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The <hi rend="italics">Express</hi> describes the scene after nightfall on Monday as &#x0022;somewhat dangerous to behold, though in the highest degree attractive, and approaching the sublime.&#x0022; We think that is a sort of &#x0022;attraction&#x0022; possessing few charms, but rather calculated to create a nervous desire to get away from it by the earliest opportunity. &#x0022;Away in the distance,&#x0022; continues the <hi rend="italics">Express, </hi> &#x0022;could be seen mortar shells ascending and descending in every direction, thicker far than ever shooting meteors showed themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Some of them seemed to ascend almost to the very regions of the stars, and, gracefully curving, would descend with inconceivable rapidity, their blazing fuses emitting a brilliant light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Others, less ambitions, would shoot up an <num value="100">hundred</num> or <measure n="2feet" type="distance">two feet</measure> and quickly disappear below the horizon, lighting the heavens with the blase of their explosions.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> All of which makes a very pretty picture on canvas or paper, but rather more pleasing in the imagination than in the reality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>It is gratifying to state that during all this shelling no personal injury was sustained, and the damage to property was comparatively slight. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> An impression has got abroad that the enemy is weakening his force on the <orgName n="Weldon Railroad" type="railroad">Weldon railroad</orgName>; and some have gone so far as to assert that he is preparing to abandon his position altogether.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>It is hardly necessary to state that there is no foundation whatever for this belief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>In his official report of the battle on <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct>, while he admits a defeat, he puts down his loss at <num value="12">twelve</num> to <num value="1500">fifteen hundred</num>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Now, we know that over <measure n="2000" type="prisoners">two thousand prisoners</measure> have been received here as the fruits of that engagement, and we have undoubted authority for saying that it took the. <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> details, under flag of truce, <measure n="2days" type="date">two days</measure> to complete the burial of their dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Their losses on that occasion certainly number several <num value="1000">thousand</num>; but exactly how many we shall probably never know.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/> On the <date value="1863-07-22">22d of July, 1863,</date> the <name>Cartel</name> of Exchange was agreed upon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>The chief, if not only, purpose of that instrument was to secure the release of all prisoners of war. To that and, the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> article provides that all prisoners of war should be discharged on parole in <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> after their capture, and that the prisoners then held, and those thereafter taken, should be transported to the points mutually agreed upon at the expense of the capturing party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>The <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> article also stipulates that &#x0022;all prisoners, of whatever arm of service, are to be exchanged or paroled in <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> from the time of their capture, if it be practicable to transfer them to their own lines in that time; if not, as soon thereafter as practicable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/> From the date of the cartel until <dateStruct value="1863-07-"><month reg="07">July</month>, <year reg="1863">1863</year></dateStruct>, the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities held the excess of prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>During that interval, deliveries were made as fast as the <rs>Federal Government</rs> furnished transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Indeed, upon more than <num value="1">one</num> occasion I urged the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities to send increased means of transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>As ready as the enemy always has been to bring false accusations against us, it has never been alleged that we failed or neglected to make prompt deliveries of prisoners who were not under charges when we held the excess.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>On the other hand, during the same time, the cartel was openly and notoriously violated by the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Officers and men were kept in cruel confinement, sometimes in irons or doomed cells, without charges or trial. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/> In <date value="1863-07">July, 1863,</date> the enemy, for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> time since the adoption of the cartel, held the excess of prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>As soon as that fact was ascertained, whenever a delivery was made by the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities they demanded an equal number in return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>I endeavored frequently to obtain from the <rs>Federal</rs> <rs type="role" reg="Agent of Exchange">Agent of Exchange</rs> a distinct avowal of the intentions of his Government as to the delivery of prisoners, but in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/> More than a month ago I asked your acquiescence in a proposition, that all officers and soldiers on both sides should be released in conformity with the provisions of the cartel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>In order to obviate the difficulties between us, I suggested that all officers and men on both sides should be released unless they were subject to charges; in which event, the opposite Government should have the right of holding <num value="1">one</num> or more hostages, if the retention was not justified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>You stated to me, in conversation, that this proposition was very fair, and that you would ask the consent of your Government to it. </p>
