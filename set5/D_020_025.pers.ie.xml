<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Not less than <num value="3000">three thousand</num> persons were attracted to the <rs>Union Course</rs> yesterday, and the greatest excitement prevailed before and during the race. </p> </q><bibl n="a New York paper, of the 16th,"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> The match was for <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">$1,000</measure>, mile heats, best <num value="3">three</num> in <num value="5">five</num>, to wagons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The odds yesterday were heavily in <persName n="Flora,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:Flora,nomatch:0"><surname>Flora</surname></persName>'s favor, a great-deal of money having been invested at <num value="100">100</num> to <num value="60">60</num>, <num value="50">50</num>, <num value="40">40</num>, and even <num value="30">30</num>, against the double team.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>McMann's known determination, never to let the bay male be beaten if he could prevent it, gave <persName n="Flora,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Flora,nomatch:0"><surname>Flora</surname></persName>'s friends every assurance that <persName><foreName>Ethan</foreName></persName> would not win the match unless he made better time than was ever heard of before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>And yet it was only apparently a sale thing for the mare, for in reality she was contending at tearful odds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The running mate of <persName><foreName>Ethan</foreName></persName> really pulled all the weight, and left him free to do his beat; whereas <persName n="Flora,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Flora,nomatch:0"><surname>Flora</surname></persName> had the whole weight of her wagon and driver to drag. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/> <persName><foreName>Ethan</foreName></persName> never looked better in his live than he did yesterday, and his mate, Socks, showed splendid condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Socks is a fine <num value="8">eight</num>-years old day, well ribbed up, and has a very powerful arm and a pretty head. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> <hi rend="italics"><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> Heat</hi>--The double team drew the inside, and after ones core the horses got off very nicely together.

After passing the half mile, <persName><foreName>Ethan</foreName></persName> broke again, but caught nicely and made a brush, keeping well ahead of <persName n="Flora,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00031" reg="mostcommon:Flora,nomatch:0"><surname>Flora</surname></persName>, who was going at a towering pace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>The advantage was kept by <persName><foreName>Sam</foreName></persName>, who urged his horses to a most terrific speed, and shouted to <persName n="Flora,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00032" reg="mostcommon:Flora,nomatch:0"><surname>Flora</surname></persName> like a wild <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> As the horses wheeled into the home stretch every eye was strained to see the race, and the utmost excitement prevailed in the crowd.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>There was a great cloud of dust, looking like gold powder in the slanting sunshine, and out of it loomed the forms of the <num value="3">three</num> splendid horses rushing down the course as if swept along by a whirlwind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>As they reached the stand the wildest cries were uttered, and short, nervous cheers given by those who saw their favorites ahead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Then in an instant the horses came up with the pickets passed the score, and in a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> had swept by like a dream.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>As they rushed past the stand and the flag fell, the multitude cheered to the echo, and many a hat was flung into the air. Everybody knew that great time had been made, and those who had bet that nothing better than <num value="2.23">2.23</num> and <num value="2.27">2.27</num> would be made, looked chopfallen enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>There was a rush of the crowd toward the judge's stand, a moment of breathless silence, and then a great on burst of applause as it was announced that the double team won the heat in <num value="2.22.5">2.22&#x00BD;</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Then there was a buzz of excitement, and every tongue seemed going at once; for the time <hi rend="italics">was <measure n="2seconds" type="date">two seconds</measure> better than was ever made to wagons before</hi>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/> <hi rend="italics"><num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num> and <num value="3" type="ordinal">Third</num> Heats</hi>--The horses did not get off for the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> heat for nearly an hour, since <persName n="McLaughlin,,Sam,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00033" reg="default:McLaughlin,Sam,,,"><foreName>Sam</foreName> <surname>McLaughlin</surname></persName> perversely prevented a send-off by not keeping his team in hand for <persName n="Flora,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="mostcommon:Flora,nomatch:0"><surname>Flora</surname></persName> to get a fair start with him &mdash; At last they got the word, and went off well together, the team a trifle ahead if anything Sam. went at his old trick again, and made <persName n="Flora,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00035" reg="mostcommon:Flora,nomatch:0"><surname>Flora</surname></persName> break at the turn, and whether McMann could not catch her up in time or not we do not know, but the team got <num value="2">two</num> lengths ahead at the quarter post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>An advantage was kept until they reached the home stretch, but <persName n="Flora,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00036" reg="mostcommon:Flora,nomatch:0"><surname>Flora</surname></persName> made <num value="1">one</num> of her fire bursts as they neared the <num value="3">three</num>-quarter post, and gained about half the distance back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The trotting throughout the heat was as magnificent as in the previous <num value="1">one</num>, especially down the stretch, where the horses went in a style that we never saw equalled. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/> <persName><foreName>Ethan</foreName></persName>'s gait was really splendid, more even easy and unchanging than any horse ever showed before, we think.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/><persName><foreName>Sam</foreName></persName> yelled at <persName n="Flora,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00037" reg="mostcommon:Flora,nomatch:0"><surname>Flora</surname></persName> all the way down the stretch as if he had escaped from Bedlam, but she did not break until just as she neared the score, when, his purpose being accomplished, <persName><foreName>Sam</foreName></persName> turned complacently to rein in his own flying team.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>The half mile of this heat was made in <num value="1.11.5">1.11 &#x00BD;</num>; the mile in <num value="2.22">2.22</num>--still better than the preceding <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>The team won this heat by about a length, and it was as clear as could be that <persName n="Flora,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00038" reg="mostcommon:Flora,nomatch:0"><surname>Flora</surname></persName> had no chance of saving the race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>So apparent was it, that the betting virtually ceased, although there were a very few investments at more reasonable rates than before the commencement of the race. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/> There was no scoring for the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> heat, the horses getting off at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> attempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/><persName n="Flora,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00039" reg="mostcommon:Flora,nomatch:0"><surname>Flora</surname></persName> broke at the turn as before, but caught soon, and the double team gained an advantage which they kept throughout.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>The quarter was made in <measure n="37seconds" type="date">37 seconds</measure> the half <num value="1.12.5">1.12&#x00BD;</num>, and the mile in <num value="2.23.5">2.23 &#x00BD;</num>--<persName n="Eilen,,Ethan,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00040" reg="default:Eilen,Ethan,,,"><foreName>Ethan</foreName> <surname>Eilen</surname></persName> and his <persName n="Socks,Mate,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00041" reg="mostcommon:Socks,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mate">mate</roleName> <surname>Socks</surname></persName> winning the race, after a contest which will be memorable in sporting circles for all time, not only as the fastest of the kind thus far made but <num value="1">one</num> of the most prettily conducted throughout.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>No <num value="1">one</num> who has not seen a Russian droschky drawn by its triple team of <num value="2">two</num> running horses and <num value="1">one</num> trotter yoked together, can imagine how exciting it is to see such a race as that of yesterday &mdash; Socks, the runner, flew over the ground like a thoroughbred in the <name>Derby</name>, stretching out his head in front, and leaping like a greyhound, while Ethan Alien, undisturbed by his companion's gait, kept up his magnificent trot from score to score, his legs moving squarely under him and his long tail and mane streaming like black banners in the air. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/> Since his great double team race with Lantern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/><persName><foreName>Ethan</foreName></persName> has done nothing, and his fame was in a fair way of being forgotten, while Patchen had been taking the cream of the stud business, at high prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>But yesterday's race has redeemed the past, and made him for the time the most celebrated trotting horse in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>It is said that the preliminaries of another match between <persName n="Flora,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00042" reg="mostcommon:Flora,nomatch:0"><surname>Flora</surname></persName> to harness, and <persName><foreName>Ethan</foreName></persName> and his mate as before, have been arranged, and that the race will be trotted on Union Course next <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>In case it should be announced, we advise all interested in trotting horses to attend, for, undoubtedly, it will be the most remarkable trotting match on record. </p>

Nobody can be more calmly indifferent than he &mdash; only <num value="1">one</num> party consists of <q>&#x0022;native anarchists guided by foreign murderers&#x0022;</q> </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>Both nations will be the stronger and the better for it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/> This separation must have come; and there is no use in exciting or distressing ourselves about it. The <num value="2">two</num> sections of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> have long read the <rs>Constitution</rs> in <num value="2">two</num> different senses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>Holding incompatible principles as to the rights both of person and property, it was only by equivocations they could pretend to be living under <num value="1">one</num> Government.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/> <q>&#x0022;Fabricious&#x0022;</q> states the present issue with perfect accuracy; and I adopt it without altering a word: <q>&#x0022;The simple principle involved in <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00051" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s election was this --Shall the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> not yet admitted as States into the <rs>Union</rs> be preserved free from the state of slavery, or shall the slaveholders be at liberty to drive their slaves there, as they would their cattle, and make them slave States?&#x0022;</q>--Precisely so; there are vast territories for settlement, belonging equally to all the citizens of the late Confederacy; and the election of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00052" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> affirms the principle that Northern men may go in there with their property and settle, but that Southern men may not. It involves the <q>&#x0022;principle&#x0022;</q> that negro slavery is a stain, and slaveholders sinners, or rather indeed a species of lepers --not to be meddled with where they are, (being incurable,) but to be inclosed within a ring fence shut up at home with a plague mark upon their door, last they should infect sound and wholesome citizens. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/> The very idea of a Confederacy implies equality before the law; but this new principle establishes the most insulting kind of inequality; it enables the stronger party not only to thrust the weaker out of a portion of their inheritance, but to do it on the express ground that they are loathsome sinners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>This would never do Apart from the right or wrong of slavery, (which I do not here argue,) you could hardly expect that Southern men, who are the most high-spaded of all men, would acquiesce in a <q>&#x0022;principle&#x0022;</q> which brands them as malefactors. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/> We were greatly entertained with an article of the <orgName n="New York Tribune" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi></orgName>, written before the great battle of the <num value="21" type="ordinal">21st</num>, in which the eminent philosopher and saint who conducts that civilized and philanthropical journal proposes that the <name>North</name> and <name>South</name> should have a big battle, and that the section which is whipped should no longer continue the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/> We have not soon the <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi> since the battle, but take it for granted that it has backed out from its proposition more rapidly than the invading army from <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>.--When it proposed its terms, it had no more doubt that the <rs>South</rs> would be whipped at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> than it has of the sun's rising tomorrow; but, now that the <rs>North</rs> is the vanquished party, we shall have no more peace propositions from that quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>It was edifying to see the main ground on which the humane and benevolent <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi> wanted the matter left to the decision of a great battle; and that was, to demonstrate the manhood of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>Well, although numbering more than <num value="2">two</num> to <num value="1">one</num>, and having that incentive to valor in their favor, we concede, on the statements of Southern officers in the battle, that the <rs>North</rs> fought bravely and obstinately, and therefore, having demonstrated its valor, the <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi> is bound in justice to go for peace, to inform the <rs>North</rs> that the point of <q>&#x0022;honor&#x0022; </q> is satisfied, and therefore there is nothing else left to fight for. The gigantic duel has taken place; both combatants came up to the scratch; <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><foreName>David</foreName></persName>,</hi> with his sling and stone, whipped <hi rend="smallcaps">Goliath</hi> to death, and took away his spear and his sword, and we think that, according to all the laws of <q>&#x0022;honor,&#x0022;</q> <hi rend="smallcaps">Goliaths</hi> friends ought to be satisfied, and cease henceforth to disturb the people of <placeName key="tgn,1000119" n="1.000 3" reg="yisra'el">Israel</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/> Of course, every <num value="1">one</num> perceives that the <hi rend="italics">Tribune's</hi> solicitude to demonstrate Northern valor is a miserable piece of hypocrisy, in keeping with its uniform system and design of irritating and provoking the <rs>North</rs> to bloodshed, by holding up before it the fear of being considered a race of cowards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>Most of the regiments are within the entrenchments on <placeName reg="Arlington Heights, Monroe, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2086064">Arlington Heights</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>The condition of those who remain in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> is deplorable in the extreme &mdash; many of them hatless, coatless, shoeless, and in some instances without pantaloons &mdash; mostly unarmed, having flung away everything in their flight &mdash; standing, limping, lying or waiting upon the corners of streets, or the stoops of houses, and appealing to the charity of passengers for means to buy food and tobacco --Much blame is attached to their officers for not making greater efforts to collect these disorganized wrecks of the <q>&#x0022;Grand Army,&#x0022;</q> but the difficulty in many cases is that the officers themselves are among the missing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/> Army officers of capacity and intelligence do not hesitate to pronounce the present army demoralized beyond the possibility of successful reorganization, and express the conviction that the attempt to supply its place with another, will prove an utter failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>The rank and file of the new army, they say, will be worse than that of the old <num value="1">one</num>, which comprised nearly all the uniformed volunteer corps of the <rs>Northern</rs> cities, and was consequently of the best material, so far as intelligence and some previous knowledge of tactics went, that the country could afford --and as for the officers, they ask, How does the <rs>Government</rs> expect to find better?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>To fill the new regiments with the same class of incapables, who received commissions before, is to incur the certainty of similar defeat, while, if Government proposes to appoint none but educated military men to positions in its new army, it will have to wait for a few years until <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName> can furnish them; for, at present, there is not a sufficient number of such in the country to officer properly an army of <num value="100000">100,000</num> men.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>To such an extent has this feeling arisen, especially among the <rs>Federal</rs> soldiers, that apprehensions were felt that the few Confederate prisoners who were in the city would be massacred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>A violent assault was yesterday made by a mob upon a party of <measure n="4" type="prisoners">four prisoners</measure>, who were brought into the city under an escort of soldiers, and after a hearing before <persName n="Mansfield,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00125" reg="mostcommon:Mansfield,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Mansfield</surname></persName>, were being taken to the old <rs>Capitol</rs> building, which is now used as a guard-house.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/> Beyond additional lists of the killed and wounded, and Munchausen-like stories of the feats of valor performed by individuals during the battle, the <rs>Washington</rs> papers of this morning contain absolutely nothing; in regard to the present and future plans of the <name>Administration</name>, they are ominously silent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>As an illustration of the means which are used to inflame the popular passions, and create another war-fever at the <rs>North</rs>, we may quote the statement of the official paper, <q>&#x0022;The <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs>,&#x0022;</q> that the <rs>Confederates</rs>, in the late battle, used balls coated with a substance <q>&#x0022;supposed to be of a poisonous nature,&#x0022;</q> of which large numbers were found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>In like manner the <rs>Associated Press</rs> lends itself to the same infamous purpose, by giving currency to the story of a Zouave about the cruelties practised upon his comrades-- whom he pretended to have seen tied to tress, as the <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indians</rs> used to serve their captives, and tortured with bayonets in lieu of arrows. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/> A deception of a different kind and of a less revolting nature is that attempted to be practiced on the people in regard to the amount of the <rs>Federal</rs> loss in the late battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>It having been found that the capture of <orgName n="Battery"><persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00128" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s Battery</orgName>, on account of the <hi rend="italics">prestige</hi> which has always attached, in this country, to that particular arm of the service, was having a peculiarly depressing effect, <num value="6">six</num> pieces of artillery, which had not been in the battle at all, were produced and are now exhibited on <placeName key="tgn,3000920" n="1.000 3" reg="capitol hill, washington, district of columbia">Capitol Hill</placeName> as <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00129" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s guns, to satisfy the people that they have not been taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>It is impossible for such a paltry piece of deception to countervail the concurrent statement of every correspondent who witnessed the battle, or has been at any pains to ascertain the facts, that the guns were among the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> that fell into the hands of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>In addition to the foregoing, gleaned chiefly from private but altogether reliable sources, we subjoin the following, which appeared in part of our last edition yesterday evening, not having been received in time to appear in the entire edition, part of which had already been worked off. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>The comments of the <rs>Northern</rs> <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> press upon the great <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">Battle at Manassas</rs> develop some further views of the inglorious flight of the <q>&#x0022;Grand Army;&#x0022;</q> but the most graphic account of that event that we have seen is furnished by the <rs>Washington</rs> correspondent of the <orgName n="New York World" type="newspaper">New York World</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>The endeavor to smooth over their defeat by re-presenting that the <q>&#x0022; Rebel&#x0022;</q> force numbered <num value="90000">90,000</num> men, will hardly <q>&#x0022;go down&#x0022;</q> with readers on the other side of the <rs>Atlantic</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>The world's correspondent says: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/> Near <time value="4oclock">4 o'clock</time>, I rode forward through the open plain to the <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs> where the abattis was being assailed by our engineers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>The Ohio Connection and <orgName type="mil" key="MNRegiment">Minnesota Regiments</orgName> were variously posted thereabout; others were in distant portions of the field; all were completely exhausted and partly dissevered; no <rs type="role" reg="General">General</rs> of division, except <persName n="Tyler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00218" reg="mostcommon:Tyler,nomatch:0"><surname>Tyler</surname></persName>, could be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>Where were our officers?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>Where was the foe?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>Who know whether we had won or lost? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>The question was quickly to be decided for us. A sudden swoop and a body of cavalry rushed down upon our columns near the bridges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/>They came from the woods on the left, and infantry poured out behind them.--<persName n="Tyler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00219" reg="mostcommon:Tyler,nomatch:0"><surname>Tyler</surname></persName> and his staff, with the reserve, were apparently cut off by the quick man&#x0152;uvre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>I succeeded in gaining the position I had just left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>There witnessed the captures of <placeName reg="Carlisle, Cumberland, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7013550">Carlisle</placeName>'s battery in the plain, and saw another force of cavalry and infantry pouring into the road at the very spot where the battle had commenced, and near which the <rs>South</rs> <rs n="Carolinian" type="group">Carolinians</rs>, who manned the battery silenced in the morning, had doubtless all day been lying concealed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>The ambulances and wagons gradually advanced to the spot, and of course and instantaneous confusion and dismay resulted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>Our own infantry broke ranks in the field, plunged into the woods to avoid the road, and got up the hill as best they could, without leaders, every man saving himself in his own way. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/> By the time I reached the top of the hill, the retreat, the panic, the heedless, headlong confusion, I was now beyond a hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>I was near the rear of the movement, with the brave <persName n="Alexander,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00220" reg="mostcommon:Alexander,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Alexander</surname></persName>, who endeavored, by the most gallant, but unavailable exertions, to check the on ward tumult.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>It was difficult to believe in the reality of our sudden reverse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/><q>&#x0022;What does it all mean?&#x0022;</q> I asked of <persName n="Alexander,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00221" reg="mostcommon:Alexander,nomatch:0"><surname>Alexander</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/><q>&#x0022;It means defeat,&#x0022;</q> was his reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/><q>&#x0022;We are beaten, it is a shameful, a cowardly retreat!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>Hold up, men,&#x0022;</q> he shouted; <q>&#x0022;don't be such internal cowards&#x0022;</q> and he rode backwards and forwards, placing his horse across the road and vainly trying to rally the running troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>The teams and wagons confused and dismembered every corps. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/> We were now cut off from the advance body by the enemy's infantry, who had rushed on the slope just left by us, surrounded the guns and settler's wagons, and were apparently pressing up against us. <q>&#x0022;It's no use, <persName n="Alexander,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00222" reg="mostcommon:Alexander,nomatch:0"><surname>Alexander</surname></persName>,&#x0022;</q> I said, <q>&#x0022;you must leave with the rest.&#x0022;</q> <q>&#x0022;I'll be d &mdash; d if I will,&#x0022;</q> was his sullen reply, and the splendid fellow rode back to make his way as best he could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>Meantime I saw officers with leaves and eagles on their shoulder straps, <rs type="role2">Majors</rs> and <rs type="role2">Colonels</rs>, who had deserted their comrades, pass me galloping as if for dear life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>No enemy pursued just then; but I suppose all were afraid that his guns would be trained down the long, narrow avenue, and mow the retreating <num value="1000">thousands</num>, and batter to pieces army wagons and everything else which crowded it. Only <num value="1">one</num> field officer, so far as my observation extended, seemed to have remembered his duty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/> <persName n="Speidel,Lieutenant-Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00223" reg="mostcommon:Speidel,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieut. Col.</roleName> <surname>Speidel</surname></persName>, a foreigner attached to a <orgName type="mil" key="CTRegiment">Connecticut Regiment</orgName>, strove against the current for a league.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>I positively declare that with the <num value="2">two</num> exceptions mentioned, all efforts made to check the panic before Contraville was reached were confined to civilians.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>I saw a man in citizen's dress, who had thrown off his coat, seine a musket and was trying to rally the soldiers who came by, at the point of the bayonet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>In reply to a question for his name, he said it was <persName n="Washburne,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00224" reg="mostcommon:Washburne,nomatch:0"><surname>Washburne</surname></persName>, and I learned that he was the member by that name from <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>. <rs type="role" reg="the Honorable">The Hon.</rs> <persName n="Kellogg,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00225" reg="mostcommon:Kellogg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Kellogg</surname></persName> made a similar effort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>Both these Congressmen bravely stood their ground till the lost moment, and were serviceable at <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName> in assisting the halt there ultimately made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/>And other civilians did what they could. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/> But what a scene!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>and how terrific the on set of that tumultuous retreat!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>For <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> hosts of Federal troops &mdash; all detached from their regiments, all mingled in <num value="1">one</num> disorderly rout --were flecing along the road, but mostly through the loss on either side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>Army wagons, sutlers' teams and private carriages, chocked the passage, tumbling against each other, amid clouds of dust, and sickening sights and sounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>Hacks, containing unlucky spectators of the late affray, were smashed like glass, and the occupants were lost sight of in the <hi rend="italics">debris.</hi> Horses, flying wildly from the battle field, many of them in death agony, galloped at random forward, joining in the stampede.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>Those on foot who should catch them rode them bareback, as much to save themselves from being run over as to make quicker time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/> Wounded men lying along the banks &mdash; the few either left on the field or taken to the captured hospitals, appealed with raised hands to those who rode horses, begging to be lifted behind; but few regarded such petitions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="448"/>Then the artillery, such as was saved, came thundering along, smashing and overpowering everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="449"/>The regular cavalry, I record it to their shame, joined in the melee, adding to its terrors, for they rode down footmen without mercy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="450"/><num value="1">One</num> of the great guns was overturned, and lay amid the ruins of a caisson, as I passed it. I saw an artilleryman running between the ponderous fore and after wheels of his gun-carriage, hanging on with both hands and vainly striving to jump upon the ordnance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="451"/>The drivers were spurring the horses; he could not cling much longer, and a more agonized expression never fixed the features of a drowning man. The carriage bounded from the roughness of a steep hill leading to a <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>; he lost his hold, fell, and in an instant the great wheels had crushed the life out of him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="452"/> Who ever saw such a fight?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="453"/>Could the retreat at <placeName reg="Borodino, Onondaga, New York" key="tgn,2068136">Borodino</placeName> have exceeded it in confusion and tumult?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="454"/>I think not. It did not slack in the least until <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName> was reached.--There the sight of the reserve &mdash; <orgName n="Miles' Brigade"><persName n="Miles,Brigade,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00226" reg="mostcommon:Miles,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Brigade"></roleName><surname>Miles</surname></persName>' Brigade</orgName> &mdash; formed in order on the hill, seemed somewhat to reassure the van. But still the teams and foot soldiers pushed on, passing their own camp and heading swiftly for the distant Potomac, until for <measure n="10miles" type="distance">ten miles</measure> the road over which the grand army had so lately passed southward, gay with unstained banners, and flushed with surety of strength, was forevers with the fragments of its retreating forces, shattered and panic-stricken in a single day. From the branch rout the trains attached to <orgName n="Division"><persName n="Hunter,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00227" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><surname>Hunter</surname></persName>'s Division</orgName> had caught the contagion of the flight, and poured into its already swollen current another turbid freshet of confusion and dismay. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="455"/> Who ever saw a more shameful abandonment of munitions gathered at such vast expense?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="456"/>The teamsters, many of them, cut the traces of their horses, and galloped from the wagons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="457"/>Others threw out their loads to accelerate their flight, and grain, picks and shovels, and provisions of every kind, lay trampled in the dust for leagues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="458"/><num value="1000">Thousands</num> of muskets strewed the route; when some of us succeeded in rallying a body of fugitives, and forming them in a line across the road, hardly <num value="1">one</num> but had thrown away his arms.--If the enemy had brought up his artillerists and served upon the retreating train, or had intercepted our progress with <num value="500">five hundred</num> of his cavalry, he might have captured enough supplies for a week's feast of thanksgiving. --As it was enough was left behind to tell the story of the panic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/>The rout of the <rs>Federal</rs> army was complete. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/>The sight of <orgName n="Miles' Reserve"><persName n="Miles,Reserve,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00228" reg="mostcommon:Miles,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Reserve"></roleName><surname>Miles</surname></persName>' reserve</orgName> drawn upon the hills at <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName>, supporting a full battery of field-pieces, and the efforts of the few officers still faithful to their trust, encouraged many of the fugitive infantry to seek their old camps and go no further.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>But the majority pushed on to a point near the late site of <placeName reg="Germantown, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,2099260">Germantown</placeName>, where <persName n="Brisbane,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00229" reg="mostcommon:Brisbane,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenant</roleName> <surname>Brisbane</surname></persName> had formed a line of <orgName n="Artillery"><persName n="Hunt,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00230" reg="nearbymention:Hunt,Philip,T.,,"><surname>Hunt</surname></persName>'s Artillery</orgName> across the road, and repulsed all who attempted to break through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>I particularly request attention to the service thus rendered by this loyal young officer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/> While he was thus engaged, a courier arrived with the news that <persName n="Montgomery,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00231" reg="mostcommon:Montgomery,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Montgomery</surname></persName> was advancing with a <orgName type="mil" key="NJBrigade">New Jersey Brigade</orgName> from <placeName reg="Fails Church">Fails Church</placeName>, and that the retreat must be stopped, only the wagons being allowed to pass through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>Some <num value="1000">thousands</num> of the soldiery had already got far on their way to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>These were those from whom the details of the repulse were gathered this morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>Poor fellows!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>who could blame them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>Their own <rs type="role2">Colonels</rs> had deserted them, only leaving orders for them to reach <placeName reg="Arlington Heights, Washington, Ohio" key="tgn,2137138">Arlington Heights</placeName> as soon as they could. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/> A few miles further, I met <persName n="Montgomery,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00232" reg="mostcommon:Montgomery,nomatch:0"><surname>Montgomery</surname></persName> swiftly pressing to the rescue, and reported the success of <persName n="Brisbane,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00233" reg="mostcommon:Brisbane,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut.</roleName> <surname>Brisbane</surname></persName>'s efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/>And so I rode along, as well as my wearied horse could carry me, past groups of straggling fugitives, to <persName n="Fairfax,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00234" reg="mostcommon:Fairfax,nomatch:0"><surname>Fairfax</surname></persName>, where <persName n="Woodbury,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00235" reg="mostcommon:Woodbury,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Woodbury</surname></persName> was expecting and guarding against a flank movement of the enemy, and on again to <placeName reg="Long Bridge, Onondaga, New York" key="tgn,2070284">Long Bridge</placeName> and the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/>But the van of the runaway soldiers had made such time that.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="472"/>I found a host of them at the <rs>Jersey</rs> entrenchments, begging the sentinels to allow them to cross the bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>To day we learn of the safe retreat of the main body of the army; that they were feebly followed by the rebels as far as <placeName reg="Fairfax, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,7014159">Fairfax</placeName>, but are now within the <rs type="place">Arlington lines</rs>, and that <persName n="McDowell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00236" reg="mostcommon:McDowell,nomatch:0"><surname>McDowell</surname></persName>, a stunned and vanquished General, is overlooking the wreck of his columns from his old quarters at the <name>Custis</name> mansion. </p> </q><bibl n="The world's correspondent"></bibl></cit>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="477"/> This town has been to day the theatre of events and spectacles, the like of which have never before been witnessed on this continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="478"/>The Grand Army of the <rs>Union</rs>, which so lately left here in all the pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war, with drums beating, colors flying and ranks dressed as if for a holiday parade, returned to-day, but in such a plight that it was taxing credulity to the utmost to believe that these were the same men. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="479"/> It is impossible to conceive of a more deplorable spectacle, to say nothing of the repulsive and harrowing appearance of dead and wounded bodies; the living and unwounded men themselves were fit objects of nothing but compassion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="480"/>Exhausted with fatigue and hunger, fear and dismay upon every countenance, with torn clothing, covered with dust and blood, many without shoes or hats, they were to be seen in all quarters of the town, lying upon the pavements, cellar-doors, or on my other spot that offered them a place for the repose which nature demanded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="481"/>Many of them had not their arms, knapsacks, &#x0026;c., and had nothing of the appearance of soldiers left except their besmeared and tattered uniforms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="482"/>They did not pretend to observe any order, nor did their officers seem to exercise the least authority over them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="483"/>They went where they pleased, happy, apparently, that they had scraped even, if but temporarily, from the disgusting tasks which their leaders had vainly sought to accomplish by their hands. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="484"/>The inhabitants of this city who, when these soldiers were here in all their arrogance and pride, had refused to countenance them or to treat them otherwise than intruders and enemies, were now touched with compassion it their altered condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="485"/>Food was freely served to them from their houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="486"/>Some of the more exhausted and wearied were taken in and cared for, and drink and refreshments were sent to them by the servants of men and women whom they had come to despoil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="487"/>The Virginia heart opened itself to the distresses of those whom it refused to countenance when they came to demand permission and impose terms at the point of the bayonet. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="490"/>There is still great excitement, uneasiness and apprehension in this city, though apparently decreasing in fervor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="491"/>Many of the troops who fled in dismay to the woods are now coming in like frightened sheep returning to the fold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="492"/>They are scattered about the city &mdash; the more desperate ones marauding upon the citizens' purses and provender for their daily sustenance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="493"/>I do not desire to intimate that highway robberies are frequent, but that the soldiers who are without money ask in such a peremptory manner that it is almost impossible to deny their requests without being in most instances insulted, to place the matter in the mildest possible form. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="495"/>Guns have been mounted and given to artillery companies, and the public informed that they have been recovered from the battle field, the enemy not having followed sufficiently far to capture them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="496"/>They do not seem to reflect that, if this be true, that it only adds to the over whelming disgrace of the fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="497"/>What excuse can be made for a man calling himself a soldier who would abandon his guns when the foe was not even in sight? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>There is no doubt about the extent of the <rs>Federal</rs> loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>It has not been exaggerated in your accounts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/>Government officials now pretend to say that it is only <num value="1200">1,200</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>The assertion is a reflection on the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> name.--The fact that an army of <num value="20000">20,000</num> men, splendidly equipped, should abandon all their artillery and war equipped, should abandon all their artillery and war equipage, and retreat in such utter disorder before an enemy whom they but a few hours before affected to despise, after sustaining a loss of only <num value="1200">1,200</num>, would affix a lasting stigma which no subsequent heroism could wipe out.

<head>The great Fire in <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/> The huge pile of ruins caused by this fearful disaster continues as unapproachable as ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>Even with all the assistance afforded by the late heavy rains, and the continuous streams of water which are poured on them on all parts from the mains by night and day, the heat they give off is so intense that it is impossible to penetrate beyond a few yards in side the blackened walls from the land side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>Nothing dare approach them from the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/>In the centre several large cellars of oil and tallow are blazing as furiously as ever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>The glare of these flames, which are unseen during the day, shines out as brightly as before with night fall when, of course, the alarm is spread that the fire has again started on a fresh career of destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/>There is, however, we are happy to say, not the least danger of such additional loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>All the ruins on the outskirts (except, as we have said, those next the river) are not only cold, but well saturated with water. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="788"/> The burning cellars in the centre, which cannot be reached must burn themselves out, and, from what is known of their contents, a long time must elapse before this takes place, if they are left to themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="789"/>The chiefs of the brigade, however, are of opinion that in a day or <num value="2">two</num> more they will be able to get the hose sufficiently forward to reach even these centres of <num value="5">five</num>; and if so, we may soon hope to see the last embers of this tremendous configuration extinguished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="790"/>The cellar full of tallow, beneath the warehouses, which lean so fearfully over the spot where <persName n="Braid,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00325" reg="mostcommon:Braid,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Braid</surname></persName> wood's body was discovered, has almost burnt itself away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="791"/>Since <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time> the nose of <num value="3">three</num> engines has been pouring in streams at <num value="1">one</num> end, and driving the greatest mass of fire it contains out at the other, in the centre of the ruins, where it is important for further mischief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="792"/>So great has been the quantity of water poured in here, that the vaults have been almost flooded, and an immense quantity of the melted tallow floated completely out. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="793"/> The body of flames at this point is now so much reduced that the firemen have been enabled to advance far enough to reach with water the walls at the end of the vault, through the aperture of which the mass of flame has been pouring since <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> <time>afternoon</time>, and which are therefore almost white with heat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="794"/>Tremendous clouds of steam are thrown off here as the jets of the hose fall upon the brick work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="795"/>Unfortunately, however, this side of the warehouse is as much out of the perpendicular as the front, and is still certain to become so as the mass of brick work contracts in cooling; so that, even when the fire is entirely extinguished, the imminent danger will prevent the spot being used as a base of operations for penetrating further towards the centre, where the great vaults still boil and flame unchecked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="796"/>Adjoining the cellar which has thus been partially extinguished is another, stored entirely with lard and bacon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="797"/>This has never been on fire, though to judge from the hot jets of steam that have been issuing from the loopholes since <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, the contents must have been as effectually overdone as if the flames had actually found their way in--<hi rend="italics"><orgName n="London Times" type="newspaper">London Times</orgName>,</hi> <date value="07-09">July 9.</date> </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
