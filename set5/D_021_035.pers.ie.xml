<head>Who are <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs>?</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> It was a very easy thing a few years ago to say who were and who were not <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>In those days, when the admonition of <persName n="Washington,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName>, <q>&#x0022;<unclear>P</unclear> none but <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> on guard to-night,&#x0022;</q> was the watch word of a formidable <orgName n="Political Party" type="party">political party</orgName>, the only <q> &#x0022;<persName n="Americans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Americans,nomatch:0"><surname>Americans</surname></persName>&#x0022;</q> were members of the <name>Know</name>-Nothing order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>They did not, however, long maintain the monopoly of that comprehensive and patriotic title, and after their early decease it reverted to its original proprietors, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> at large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Since the secession of the <rs>Southern States</rs> the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, with their accustomed modesty, have appropriated the old national name of <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Having previously appropriated the territories, the army and navy, the military stores, the flag, the common <rs>Capitol</rs>, Hail Columbia, and the public Exchequer, it is not to be wondered at that they assume also a monopoly of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs>, name, and that foreign nations, with their customary discrimination, have accorded to them that title.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>What justice there is in <unclear></unclear> appropriation of the name of <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs>, it would be hard to show; nor is there any equity or <unclear></unclear> in the <rs>South</rs> surrendering her claim to at least some share of Americanism. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> In the first place, it was in accordance with the swelling and beautiful spirit of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <unclear></unclear> to assume such a name even for the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> at large.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>When, in point of <unclear></unclear> A constituted so small a part, territorially and numerically, of the continent of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Still more <unclear>ridinlons</unclear> is its assumption by the fragment of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> States broken off by recent political convulsions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>As a description of race, the term is vastly more approvable to the people of the <rs>Southern</rs> than the <rs>Northern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The former are, with <unclear>le</unclear> exception, of pure <name>English</name> descent, a <unclear>mogeneons </unclear> people, identified in interests, institutions, and descent, and never having reserved more than a local visitation from the <unclear>nds</unclear> of immigration, except the hostile elements which have visited us in the lightnings and thunders of war. The <rs>North</rs> and the <rs>West</rs>, on the contrary, have been the vortex into which enormous sides of all the populations of the earth have been pouring for the last <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure>. The principal cities of the free States contain a population in many cases of <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num>, and in others, almost half, of foreign immigrants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>In the cities of New York, <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName>, <num value="1">one</num> may hear each a jargon of foreign tongues as has not been paralleled since the dispersion at the <unclear>wer</unclear> of Babel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Nor is it the cities alone, but some rural districts, comprising large portions of the best land in the country, are inhabited by colonies of <rs n="European" type="group">Europeans</rs> who still retain their old language and customs, have no knowledge of constitutional liberty, and <unclear>sympathy</unclear> with anything <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> except that which is connected with their means of living.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The Northern army now invading the <rs>South</rs> is not an <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> army, but contains at least a <num value="150000">hundred and fifty thousand</num> <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> and <rs n="German" type="group">Germans</rs>, whilst not a few even of the officers are men of foreign birth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>For such a conglomeration as this to monopolize the name of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs>, is the most barefaced piece of impudence and dishonesty which that shameless pack has ever exhibited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>When, a few years ago, the <rs>Thames</rs> was gorged and almost driven from its bed by the sewerage of <placeName reg="London, Madison, Ohio" key="tgn,2080432">London</placeName>, it was about as near the once pure and classic river of a former age as that which is now called <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> is to the <rs>America</rs> of <dateStruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></dateStruct>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> In other and even more important respects, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have no longer a claim to the name of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>; still less to the monopoly of that name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>What liberty won by our fathers; what right, franchise, or prerogative of freemen is now left that unhappy people?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>They have shivered to atoms the <rs>Union</rs> which gave <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> all its glory; they have trampled the <rs>Constitution</rs>, which was the bond and life of that Union, in a perfect tempest of passion under their feet, and <sic>dansed</sic> upon its torn fragments like so many howling dervishes; they have erected a colossal military despotism upon the ruins of <rs n="Republican" type="political">republican</rs> liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>They do not seem to be the same men, intellectually and morally, any more than politically.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Not a single statesman is left within their whole borders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Instead of the <name>Clintons</name>, Spencers, <persName n="Grosvenor,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Grosvenor,nomatch:0"><surname>Grosvenor</surname></persName>, <persName n="Livingston,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Livingston,nomatch:0"><surname>Livingston</surname></persName>, Van Nesses, and <persName n="Renselaers,,,,,Van" id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Renselaers,nomatch:0"><nameLink>Van</nameLink> <surname>Renselaers</surname></persName>, of New York, there is that miserable scrub, <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName>, combining a <persName n="Glossin,,Gilbert,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="default:Glossin,Gilbert,,,"><foreName>Gilbert</foreName> <surname>Glossin</surname></persName> and Oily <persName n="Gammon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Gammon,nomatch:0"><surname>Gammon</surname></persName>, an educated blackguard &mdash; of all blackguards, the most disgusting &mdash; a fellow without birth, <unclear>reeding,</unclear> or any of the ideas or feelings of a gentleman, and whose whole career has never exhibited <num value="1">one</num> single example of sagacious and comprehensive statesmanship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Instead of the spirit of Americanism which many years ago animated the <rs>Northern</rs> masses, there has risen that vile spirit of section which, in the choice of <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, declared that the <rs>North</rs> should be master of the <rs>South</rs>; an infamous declaration, which the <rs>South</rs>, with her drawn sword and her stout right arm, has made null and void.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Even those men of the <rs>North</rs> who once claimed to be <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> and conservatives &mdash; the <name>Events</name> of the <rs n="Whig" type="political">Whig</rs> and the <name>Dickinson</name> of the <orgName n="Democratic party" type="party">Democratic party</orgName>--have thrown themselves into the very front of the sectional crusade, and stripped themselves of every attribute of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs>, as well as every quality of the gentleman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>What magnificent assurance, then, in the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation to monopolize the once proud name of <hi rend="smallcaps"><rs n="American" type="group">American</rs>!</hi> As well might the brigands who infest the mountains and plunder the villages of modern <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName> <unclear></unclear> kindred with the demigods who have made the name of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName> immortal, or the <unclear>tteroni</unclear> who beg and steal under the shades of the eternal city, claim to be <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Romans</rs>, and the noblest <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Romans</rs> of them all. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> Nothing very interesting had transpired since my last letter to the <hi rend="italics">Dispatch </hi> until yesterday, when the people were much exercised to know the reason of a heavy and long-continued cannonade on the <rs>Carolina</rs> side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The flashes of the guns and the smoke could be distinctly seen from the battery, and it appeared so far from.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/><placeName reg="Wall's Cut">Wall's Cut</placeName> that all conjectures centered upon the little fort at <placeName reg="Red Bluff, Tehama, California" key="tgn,2013534">Red Bluff</placeName>, on <placeName reg="New River, West Virginia, West Virginia" key="tgn,1125392">New River</placeName>, as the point of attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The difficulty of receiving any authentic reports from the other side of the river rendered it useless to guess at the cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Nevertheless, a <num value="1001">thousand and one</num> reports were soon in circulation, some purporting to be reliable, and detailing circumstantially the burning of a Federal gun-boat. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> I have just been enabled to learn the truth in regard to the affair, <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure> after its occurrence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The enemy's gun-boats advanced up <placeName reg="New River, West Virginia, West Virginia" key="tgn,1125392">New river</placeName>, and for <measure n="3hours" type="date">three hours</measure> expended a large quantity of ammunition in shelling the site of the fort and adjacent woods, and after having most thoroughly satisfied themselves that no <q>&#x0022;masked battery&#x0022;</q> or rebel force lurked in the neighborhood, they landed and burnt the remnants of the camp which the <orgName n="Beaufort Artillery" type="artillery">Beaufort artillery</orgName> had evacuated on the <rs>Friday</rs> preceding.--After having achieved this feat they abandoned the position, and retired to their gun-boats, which soon after returned down stream, but have come up again to-day.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The object of the attack it is difficult to determine I cannot think it any more than a desire to drive us from a position which prevents all possibility of marauding upon the plantations in the vicinity, and which are within easy reach of their small steamers. </p>

<head>Our volunteer army notice be disbanded.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/> The appeals of the country to the volunteers now in the service, are making a profound impression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/>It could not be otherwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>The men in the field are the choice spirits of the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>They came forward at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> call of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>Their patriotism was prompt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>They rushed into the breach at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> note of alarm, and they have withstood the hardships and trials of the service with a patience and cheerfulness never witnessed before.--More than <num value="1">one</num> of our General have borne testimony to the uncomplaining temper of their troops under long and trying hardships.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>No country in the world has ever possessed a nobler or braver army of men than ours.--Their victories over the enemy are the least of their triumphs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>Their military career has been a continued series of victories over worse foes to the soldier than an armed enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/> They had been reared in the comforts and luxuries of our abundant and wealthy country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>They had been strangers to hardship and privation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>They had been little used to labor, and had known nothing of discipline and restrain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>They left comfort, wealth, luxuriant homes, and habitual case, to encounter the labor, fatigue, privation, discipline, disease, and danger of the camp; and they have not only proved to be brave men, but obedient, patient, and uncomplaining soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>They have served their country efficiently and faithfully, and they have done honor to patriotism and the name of Southern volunteer. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/> Much as the country desires to obtain a continuation of their services, every suggestion that has been made to secure this end by compulsion has met with universal remonstrance and rebuke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>To the natural indignation that has been expressed by the volunteer himself, has been added the universal protest of the country, which resents every indignity to the heroic men who came forward last <rs type="season">spring</rs> and <rs type="season">summer</rs> to enlist under the <rs>Confederate</rs> banners with so much alacrity, and who so bravely drove back the invader with loss and disgrace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>It is clear that compulsion will not be tolerated either by the army itself or by the country, which loves its volunteers as a mother her <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> born.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>The safest and surest compulsion to employ in this case is that of the volunteer's own patriotic impulses and reflections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>The case of the country was submitted to the same noble monitors last spring, and the country was saved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>A similar appeal now will meet a like response; for it is not in the nature of the <rs>Southern</rs> patriot to become lukewarm in a cause in which his kindred and country have so great a stake, and to betray all by forsaking the post of duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are capable of disbanding in the face of an enemy; but that shame has not yet disgraced the <orgName n="Southern Volunteers" type="volunteers">Southern volunteers</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/> Upon the volunteers of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> are all eyes now turned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>The question will soon be put to them in their camps, what example the men of this Commonwealth will set to their compatriots of the other States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>It is easy enough for <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to draft from her militia an army of raw recruits double as large as that of her trained and veteran volunteers now in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>The question is not as to the number of men our Commonwealth shall place in the field, but as to the kind of troops it most behooves the country to have in face of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>A very large additional force will be brought into the service, whatever the volunteers may do. A man will be found for every gun in possession of the <rs>Government</rs>, and another man be held in readiness to take it in case of sickness or accident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>It is not a question of numbers; but it is, whether our present organized, drilled, and well tried army shall be disbanded, and a new, undrilled unorganized multitude put in its place at a critical period of the campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>That is the question which the volunteers of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> will be called on to decide. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/> They have been long enough in the service to know the superiority of the trained veteran and the organized army, to the raw recruit and the crudely formed mass and multitude.--They know their own value as soldiers too well to believe that raw recruits would do as well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>Even if this conviction of superiority did not prevail, their pride would insist that an army of <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> trained men is better than a mob of a <num value="150000">hundred and fifty thousand</num> raw recruits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>Seeing these facts so plainly, it is not to be supposed that the volunteers will disappoint the hopes of their country in the present critical juncture of affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>To abandon the post of duty now, would bring a worse stain upon their reputation than if they had never volunteered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>In all after time it would be recollected with regret and spoken of with reproach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>Under all these circumstances, we are not surprised to hear of the growing feeling in the camps in favor of another long pull, strong pull, and pull altogether, for the country. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/> It is now apparent that where our forces in the field have been sustained by lines of railway reaching to them, they have over-matched the enemy; and where they have had to rely for their transportation on dirt roads, they have been driven back by the well-prepared and outnumbering force of their adversaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>It is no fault of generalship that disasters have happened under such conditions, but of the roads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>The Republic has been prodigal of the lives of her sons on these lines, but has been stingy of the means of sustaining them in their remote positions, and therefore has failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>It is notorious that the <rs>Pierpoint Government</rs> exists in Trans <placeName key="tgn,7013272" n="1.000 6" reg="allegheny, pennsylvania, united states">Allegheny</placeName> to-day, only because the <rs>State</rs> has neglected to provide access for her troops to her own frontier, to which an active and intelligent enemy has uncontested transit by land and water.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/> An effort is now being made in the <name>Senate</name> of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to awaken the <rs>State</rs> on this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/>The parsimonious member is told that the appropriation is so much of the appropriation already made to that road, and does not increase the debt of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>The anti-internal improvement member is told that the improvement is not for local benefit and welfare; but for the general defence and State existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>Demonstration is made of the fact that we cannot successfully meet the enemy, except in the <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> mountains, with the climate, diseases, and difficulties as our allies, and that we cannot maintain ourselves there without adequate transportation in the rear. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>This disadvantage the enemy is increasing by using the winter to mend the roads on his side, while we delay or hesitate to do the same on ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/> The only economical and certain defence of that country and those roads, is to keep the enemy in the mountains if we cannot drive them beyond the <rs>Ohio</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>To keep him there, or to drive him westward, we must increase our means of transportation and economize in its cost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>This can only be done successfully by pushing the railroad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>The cost of transportation for an army of <num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num> men, by wagons, from <placeName reg="Covington, Kenton, Kentucky" key="tgn,7014762">Covington</placeName> to the <rs>White Sulphur</rs> for <measure n="9months" type="date">nine months</measure>, will pay for the building of a temporary railroad on the same route.

During last summer each <orgName type="regiment" key="4Cav">four-horse</orgName> team hauled only <num value="4">four</num>-barrels of flour and its own forage between those points, and took <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> to make the round trip of <measure n="23miles" type="distance">twenty-three miles</measure> and back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>Such a team as subsistence, and driver, cost the <rs>Government</rs> not less than <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">$10</measure> per day.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/> When the transportation is so great and succedent as it is for a large army, the cost is inversely proportioned to the value and thoroughness of the road or other means used.
