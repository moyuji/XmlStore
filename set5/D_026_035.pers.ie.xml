<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> In the long and bloody war in which your country is engaged, you have achieved many noble triumphs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>You have won glorious victories over vastly more numerous boats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>You have cheerfully borne privations and toil to which you were unused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>You have readily submitted to restraints upon your individual will, that the citizen might better perform his duty to the <rs>State</rs> as a soldier.--To all these you have lately added another triumph, the noblest of human conquests &mdash; a victory over yourselves. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/> As the time drew near when you who <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> entered the service might well have been expected to claim relief from your arduous labors and restoration to the endearments of home, you have heeded only the call of your suffering country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Again you come to tender your service for the public defence &mdash; a free offering which only such patriotism as yours could make &mdash; a triumph worthy of you and of the cause to which you are devoted. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/> I would in vain attempt adequately to express the emotions with which I received the testimonials of confidence and regard which you have recently addressed to me. To some of those <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> received, separate acknowledgments were returned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>But it is now apparent that a like generous enthusiasm pervades the whole army, and that the only exception to such magnanimous tender will be of those who, having originally entered for the war, cannot display anew their zeal in the public service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>It is, therefore, deemed appropriate, and it is hoped, will be equally acceptable, to make a general acknowledgment, instead of successive special responses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>Would that it were possible to render my thanks to you in person, and in the name of our common country, as well as in my own, while pressing the hand of each war-worn veteran, to recognize his title to our love, gratitude, and admiration. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/> Soldiers: By your will (for you and the people are but <num value="1">one</num>) I have been placed in a position which debars me from sharing your dangers, your sufferings, and your privations in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>With pride and affection my heart has accompanied you in every march; with solicitude it has sought to minister to your every want; with exultation it has marked your every heroic achievement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>Yet, never in the toilsome march, nor in the weary watch, nor in the desperate assault, have you rendered a service so decisive in results as in this last display of the highest qualities of devotion and self-sacrifice which can adorn the character of the warrior- patriot. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/> Already the pulse of the whole people beats in unison with yours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Already they compare your spontaneous and unanimous offer of your lives, for the defence of your country, with the halting and reluctant service of the mercenaries who are purchased by the enemy at the price of higher bounties than have hitherto been known in war. Animated by this contrast, they exhibit cheerful confidence and more resolute bearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Even the murmurs of the weak and timid, who shrink from the trials which make stronger and firmer your noble natures, are shamed into silence by the spectacle which you present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Your brave battle cry will ring loud and clear through the land of the enemy, as well as our own; will silence the vainglorious boastings of their corrupt partisans and their pensioned press; and will do justice to the calumny by which they seek to persuade a deluded people that you are ready to purchase dishonorable safety by degrading submission. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>The flash of the guns and the report of musketry had aroused the soldiers on shore, and they were now witnesses of the scene, but determined not to be inactive ones; for, regardless of their own prisoners on board, they fired a shell into us, which, striking the upper machinery and exploding on the deck, produced a terrible shock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>I was in the cabin at the time, and thinking the vessel had been blown up, rushed on deck like others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>Another shell exploding over the deck explained the cause of the commotion, and told us the shore batteries had opened fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>There was no halting, no cowardice; every man stood at his post and did his duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>When on board they obeyed their orders promptly, and, forming on the hurricane deck, not even the explosion of the monster shell among them could break the ranks or turn a man from his post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>The steamer was boarded very handsomely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>The enemy had sufficient notice to arm themselves, and the boarders had to fight their way upon the decks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>Worst of all were the land batteries which turned their guns upon us. In the whole history of naval warfare, cutting a steamer from under land batteries has been considered the most daring and hazardous achievement that could be accomplished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>A heavy storm came up, the rain poured down in torrents, wetting us to the skin, and half filling the boats with water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>As we round a point of woods we take a last look at the burning ship, now completely enveloped in flame, the lurid light flaming in the sky and flashing for miles across the water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>Although hidden from our view, we could see by sudden flashes up the sky, and by the dull, heavy, booming sound which come to us upon the night air that the shell room was reached and that the explosion had begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>It is right to burn up the <rs n="agricultural implements" type="product">agricultural implements</rs> of the country, so that there shall be no more planting, no more harvesting, and the people shall die of Famine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>It is right to rob the private dwellings in mid winter of all the clothing and all the bed covering of the people inhabiting them.
