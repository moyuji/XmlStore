<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Their infantry was no doubt advancing in the fear ready to support them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Their force is variously estimated at from <num value="10000">10</num> to <num value="25000">25,000</num> men Opinions are much divided as to the object of this expedition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>Some suppose the design is actually to attack the city; but to us, that seems preposterous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Others think with more appearance of probability, that it is intended merely to keep up an excitement and draw off men from <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Gen,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName>.

Nevertheless, we can imagine a very good apology for such an order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>It is no doubt the object of the <rs>General</rs> to make war support war &mdash; that is to support his army in the enemy's country.--Should he allow his soldiers to pillage and burn indiscriminately, he would defeat the end in view, for the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> finding there was no hope for them would retire, and burn the country as they went before them &mdash; besides nothing is so fatal to the discipline of an army as a habit of plundering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>He cannot afford to let the discipline of his army be relaxed, especially at this time, when he has a powerful army of the enemy to fight and that too in that enemy's own country. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Some suppose that he means to attack <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, some that his object is <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> come that he merely means to make a raid into <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, and return, and some again that be intends to carry on the war on the enemy's soil, and make it support itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> The surprising genius who presides over the <unclear></unclear> at <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName> tells us that &#x0022;<unclear></unclear> staff officer who left <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> on <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> (last week) reports the garrison closely besieged.&#x0022; We had heard something of the kind before, but the report of the staff officer places the matter beyond question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>He tells us further that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>. &#x0022;admit that our tire was very destructive, and the accuracy of our guns unequalled. &#x0022; This was very candid in the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and the confession is worth its weight in gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>It would have added greatly to the interest of the story had the reporter been pleased to tell how this <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> confession was gotten at, how it came to be made, and who was the happy man that received it.--The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are generally very reticent in such matters, and much more prone to underrate then exaggerate the losses on their side and the <unclear></unclear> of their enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>If we have extorted the truth (and such a truth) from them at last they must have been awfully punished indeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>We should say they were scarcely a degree this side of annihilation. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> Vicksburg at my rate, still holds out &mdash; the wonder and the example of the whole Confederacy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>That she will ever be reduced by <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> we cannot find it in our hearts to believe it is true his mines are advancing, but the garrison is countermining, and the chances are at least even that the engineer will be &#x0022;hoist with his own petard&#x0022; before he reaches the rampart he designs to blow into the air. Should he even make a breach by means of his mines, yet many a breach has been kept, and many an assailant repulsed, before to-day by a brave and devoted garrison such as that which defends <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>There will be desperate fighting at the breach, and hundreds of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> will bite the dust before they are permitted to take possession of the city. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> Besides the noble example which the heroic defenders of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> and their noble commander have act to the whole Confederacy, they have done great service in convincing a large party in the <rs>Northwest</rs> that the best and safest plan to obtain the navigation of the <rs>Mississippi</rs> is not by force of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>They see that they cannot obtain it in this way, and as they went to war for that and nothing else, they will be clamorous for peace, as the only means of gaining their object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The leaven already begin to work &mdash; the new draft is universally abhorred, and in some places openly resisted.
