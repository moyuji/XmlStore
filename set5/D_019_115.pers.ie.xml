<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The wheat promises finely, and there never was a more flattering prospect for good crops in <persName n="Nelson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Nelson,nomatch:0"><surname>Nelson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The county is fully aroused to her sense of duty, and has formed several fine volunteer companies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The ladies are lending a helping hand, like the patriotic <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> ladies everywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Among the volunteers in <placeName reg="Nelson, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002175">Nelson county</placeName> is a young lawyer who gave up a lucrative practice and handsome property in <placeName reg="Kansas" key="tgn,7007254">Kansas</placeName>, (the latter will probably be confiscated,) and came home to help on the glorious cause of his mother State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> A letter from our regular <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName> correspondent, (which arrived somewhat behind time,) says that the <name n="United Kingdom">British</name> <term type="ship">barque</term> <rs type="ship">Volant</rs> and the <rs type="ship">Swedish</rs> <term type="ship">brig</term> <rs type="ship">Tyres</rs>, which were stopped by the blockade in <placeName key="tgn,2374406" n="1.000 34" reg="hampton roads, hampton, virginia">Hampton Roads</placeName>, and afterwards reported by <persName n="Pendergrast,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Pendergrast,Jerome,A.,,:1"><surname>Pendergrast</surname></persName> to have sailed for New York, are probably lying at anchor in <placeName reg="Lynnhaven Bay, Virginia Beach, Virginia" key="tgn,2477267">Lynnhaven Bay</placeName>; sent there, no doubt, in order to be out of sight of those whom the <hi rend="italics">blockheads</hi> expected would be sent to look after them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The letter also alludes to the fact that the troops at <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName> have taken possession of wells of water in the neighborhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The writer believes the real object is-- </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> A Fincastle correspondent recommends that town as a pleasant, safe and healthful retreat to all who, during our difficulties, would make it a home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The society is good, religious advantages ditto, and there are <num value="2">two</num> excellent hotels &mdash; all of which we can endorse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> A large number of the convicts employed by <persName n="Rosser,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Rosser,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosser</surname></persName>, and working on the <rs>Covington</rs> and <orgName n="Ohio Railroad" type="railroad">Ohio Railroad</orgName>, escaped a few days ago. <num value="2">Two</num> were re-captured on the same road, and at the same time some <num value="12">twelve</num> or more hirelings made off.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>I am credibly informed that only a guard of <num value="4">four</num> men had charge of the convicts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>They were not manacled, or in any way secured against escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Thus, by a dereliction of duty in your city, we have some <num value="90">90</num> or <num value="100">100</num> desperadoes turned loose in our county.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>At this time why not send the convicts on <placeName key="tgn,7017623" n="1.000 8" reg="york, virginia, united states">York River</placeName> to aid in putting up batteries?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>They would be under a strong guard, and of service to the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>I have just learned that <num value="1">one</num> convict and <num value="1">one</num> slave were brought in and lodged in jail last night. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The former will compare with any similar corps of the <rs>State</rs>, both as regards fine looking men, and their proficiency in the manual exercise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>These <num value="2">two</num> companies, with <num value="2">two</num> others, are now rendezvoused at <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName>, but we have heard there is a probability of <orgName n="company"><persName n="Richardson,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="nearbymention:Richardson,James,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Richardson</surname></persName>'s company</orgName> being transferred to some other point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>We have a splendid corps of Cavalry, to which your correspondent has recently had the honor of attaching himself.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> The wheat, as far as we have observed, promises more than an average yield.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>But little of it was killed by the cold weather last winter, consequently there is a fine growth, and that exceedingly luxuriant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The farmers have finished planting corn, and the most of it is up and growing prettily. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>In most cases, <num value="1">one</num> dose stops it instantly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/> The reserve shoes should be strapped on the outside of the knapsack--<num value="1">one</num> on each side; if these they have on get torn or lost, it is much easier for the soldier to ask the comer's <unclear>out</unclear> his side to unbuckle them, than to have to take down the knapsack and open it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/> It would be a great advantage for the soldiers to know how to drill by the bugle or drum, at least; also, how to display the drill, fire, advancing or retreating, in column of attack, form in groups against cavalry, and also how to form the square.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>The officers have bad plenty of time, since they have been in camp, to instruct their men. The advice is good for them to commence at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>They will find it of the greatest advantage in a conflict with the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>The cavalry will find that must of the horses will be so much frightened as to become unmanageable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>Each horse should have a piece or band of iron, with teeth, to fitches over the nose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>When they will not obey the bridle, just bring the iron in close contact with the nose of the horse, and he will obey.

The men spread through the town, and almost in the twinkling of an eye the people were in arms, and waiting for the foe. There was no gasconading, no vaporing, and no pale cheeks or trembling knees were seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>That exalted and resolute courage, which the defenders of their own firesides alone can feel to its fullest extent, was depicted in the face of every man and every boy &mdash; for boys were there, too, with guns on their shoulders, by their grandfathers' sides. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="845"/> The Stock Exchange brokers of New York it is said, are nearly all Abolitionists, and some resort to all kinds of tricks to bolster up <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00358" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s insane civil war. <num value="1">One</num> of these devices is, that whenever <persName n="Chase,,John,Brown,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00359" reg="default:Chase,John,Brown,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>Brown</foreName> <surname>Chase</surname></persName> wants a new loan, they make fictitious sales, <num value="1">one</num> with another, of <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> bonds, at advanced prices, which never change hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="846"/>This is done to bring bidders for the new loan at high rates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="847"/>The money spent on account of the war is recklessly wasted; everything is conducted in a loose and extravagant manner, and sticks in fat lumps to the palms of <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> jobbers, spoilsmen, camp followers and contractors, of course all for the sake of the <orgName n="Stars and Stripes" type="newspaper">Stars and Stripes</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="848"/>The terrorism proclaimed by Abolition mobs has subsided somewhat, both here and in New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="849"/>Commonsense people begin to reflect upon things, and look at what is going on in its true light, now and for the future. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="851"/>The truth is, that they are short of arms, and cannot supply those already called out.
