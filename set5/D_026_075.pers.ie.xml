<head>A Grant Fallacy.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/> The steady refusal of the <rs>Palmerston Ministry</rs> to form a treaty with the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>--although the independence of at least <num value="5">five</num> of them was separately and distinctly acknowledged by <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> <measure n="80years" type="date">eighty years</measure> ago &mdash; is perfectly consistent with the traditional policy of that Government.--That Government, long before the secession of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, had felt the dependence in which it had been placed upon us for the main staple of its manufactures to be a grievous and intolerable arrogance, and had made gigantic exertions to get rid of it.--With that view it had expended enormous sums in its dependencies all over the world &mdash; in <placeName key="tgn,7001242" n="1.000 120" reg="africa">Africa</placeName>, in <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName>, and in <placeName key="tgn,2140674;tgn,7000490" n="0.020 000000.6735	placename;tgn,2140674;australia island, madison, louisiana,Madison,Louisiana,United States,North and Central America;0.010 000000.3296	placename;tgn,7000490;australia,Oceania" reg="australia island, madison, louisiana,Madison,Louisiana,United States,North and Central America;australia,Oceania">Australia</placeName> &mdash; to encourage the cultivation of cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>With that view it undertook the last war against <placeName key="tgn,1000111" n="1.000 120" reg="zhonghua">China</placeName>, and promoted the culture in <placeName reg="Egypt, Chickasaw, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056358">Egypt</placeName> and <placeName reg="South America" key="tgn,1000002">South America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>As long, however, as peace continued these exertions were of no avail, for the article produced in other quarters was almost driven out of the market by the superior staple produced in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>The disruption of the <rs>Union</rs>, the war which ensued, and the blockade which followed as a consequence of the war, by putting a period to the further production of cotton in these States, were so many Godsends to <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>She could now force her own staple, from <placeName reg="Bharat" key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName>, <placeName reg="Africa" key="tgn,7001242">Africa</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Australia" key="tgn,7000490">Australia</placeName>, or the foreign staple, from <placeName reg="Misr" key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> and <placeName reg="Zhonghua" key="tgn,1000111">China</placeName>, upon the manufacturers, who were compelled to accept them or altogether abandon their factories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>True, that when peace came the certainty was that the <rs>Confederate</rs> staple would drive all the others out, and once more assume the place it had temporarily lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>But then there was the chance that, by destroying the system of labor in the <rs>South</rs> the production might be destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>Everything hung, and continues to hang, upon that chance, and for that reason the <rs>British Government</rs> chooses to encourage the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> in the bloody war which they are waging against us.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/> And yet were we to be subjugated tomorrow, so far from subserving the ends of <name>British</name> statesmen, it would utterly subvert them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/><placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, in order that she may continue to rule the seas and to possess the sources of modern wealth &mdash; that is, all the cotton in the world &mdash; is willing to encourage this war to the utmost, and thereby to leave us to the risk of subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>We are not going to be subjugated &mdash; no thanks to her; but if we were, there can be no plainer proposition than that <hi rend="italics">she</hi> would lose the dominion of the seas, every foot of land she continues to hold on this continent, and every settlement in which a pound of cotton can be reared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>She would become dependent on her rivals in manufactures and commerce for the staple on which her existence depends, and they would dole it out to her in such minute quantities, and under such heavy duties, that she must inevitably be ruined.--Any man who will reflect a moment will be convinced of this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>Suppose the old <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> re-established to morrow, with their <num value="30000000">thirty millions</num> of population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>As that population doubled every <measure n="23years" type="date">twenty three years</measure>, by the beginning of the next century it would amount to <num value="100000000">100,000,000</num>--the mightiest nation the world ever saw, thirsting for conquest, and animated with the most deadly hatred to <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, consumed by avarice, and determined that no nation should grow cotton but herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>With such a navy as she would have, how long could <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> expect to hold any of her foreign possessions?
