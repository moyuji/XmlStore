<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">1</num>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> The <rs>Judge</rs> gave his decision against the petitioners in all <measure n="3cases" type="mass">three cases</measure>. We copy the concluding portion of it: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> It appears, therefore, that the petitioner has been called out for local defence, and is held for that duty only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>And although the militia to which the petitioner belongs has been placed under the command of <persName n="Jenkins,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Jenkins,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jenkins</surname></persName>, the <orgName n="Confederate Officer" type="org">Confederate officer</orgName> commanding at <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, he has no right to employ them, and has not attempted to employ them, and does not claim the right to employ them in any other service than that for which they were called out by the <rs>State</rs> authorities. </p> </q><bibl n="The Judge"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> It follows from the views which have been presented that the militia to which the petitioner belongs have not been &#x0022;turned over to the service of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>,&#x0022; in the sense of the <name>Act</name> of <date value="02-05">February 5.</date> The troops called out by the proclamation of <date value="01-10">January 10,</date> were to be turned over to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> by being mustered into their service, and thereby passing under the exclusive control of the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities, losing the character of State militia, and becoming, for the term of their enlistment, a part of the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>, for as was said by the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> in <placeName reg="Houston, Harris, Texas" key="tgn,7013727">Houston</placeName> vs. <persName n="Moore,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Moore,James,E.,,:1"><surname>Moore</surname></persName>, after a detachment of militia have been called forth and have entered into the service of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, the authority of the <rs>General Government</rs> over such detachment is exclusive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/><num value="5">5</num> <persName n="Wheaton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Wheaton,nomatch:0"><surname>Wheaton</surname></persName>, <num value="17">17</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>It was to similar proclamations thereafter, calling for troops to be, in like manner, turned over to the exclusive control of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, that the <name>Act</name> of <date value="02-06">February 6</date> alone applied. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> By the act of the <orgName n="Provisional Congress" type="congress">Provisional Congress of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName></orgName>, passed <date value="1863-03-06">March 6, 1863,</date> it is provided that the militia, when called into service under that act, or under any other act, may be compelled to serve for a term of <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> after they shall be mustered into service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Thus, according to the views taken by the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName> in <placeName reg="Houston, Harris, Texas" key="tgn,7013727">Houston</placeName> vs. <persName n="Moore,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Moore,James,E.,,:1"><surname>Moore</surname></persName>, it would seem that the militia, when called into the service of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, are not regarded as entering that service, or losing their character of State militia until &#x0022;mustered into service.&#x0022; &#x0022;That,&#x0022; in the language of the <rs type="place">Court</rs> in that case, &#x0022;is the <hi rend="italics">terminus a quo</hi> the service, the pay, and subjection to the articles of war, are to commence and continue, &#x0022; <ref n="page 17">pp. 17</ref>, <ref n="page 30">30</ref>. And so the act of assembly of <date value="1862-02-10">February 10, 1862,</date> providing for raising troops to meet the requisition on <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, clearly contemplated the mustering into the service of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> as the means by which the troops were to be turned over to that Government--<num value="11">11</num>: The same is true of the <name>Act</name> providing for the transfer of the <rs>State</rs> troops to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, passed <date value="1863-02-18">February 18, 1863.</date> As far as I am informed, that is the only mode recognized by law by which State troops can be turned over to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> In the present case the militia have not been so turned over, and it does not appear that they are to be. The order to report to <persName n="Jenkins,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Jenkins,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jenkins</surname></persName>, and the command assumed by him in pursuance of it, may be accounted for by the <num value="98" type="ordinal">98th</num> Article of War. Embarrassing questions arose during the war of <dateStruct value="1812--"><year reg="1812">1812</year></dateStruct>, as to the mode in which State troops serving with National troops shall be commanded, but I see no reason why, independent of that Article of War, the <rs>Governor</rs> might not, independent of that Article of War, put the direction of the <rs>State</rs> troops under command of a <orgName n="Confederate Officer" type="org">Confederate officer</orgName> holding chief command in the place for whose defence those troops were called out. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> The supply of rations by the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities is explained by the fact that, as these troops were called out by the <rs>Governor</rs> at the request of the <rs>President</rs>, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> would be bound to reimburse all expenses to the <rs>State</rs>, and it was thought best to advance them in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Act of Congress, <date value="1818-04-20">April 20, 1818,</date> (<num value="3">3</num> St. at Large, <num value="444">444</num>.) Opinion of <persName n="Gilpin,Attorney-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Gilpin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Attorney-General">Attorney General</roleName> <surname>Gilpin</surname></persName>, <date value="1840-05-01">May 1, 1840.</date> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> The view which I have taken of the case makes it unnecessary to consider the objection taken by the <rs type="role" reg="Attorney-General">Attorney-General</rs> to my Jurisdiction, founded on the <orgName type="regiment" key="2Section">2d section</orgName> of the act of <date value="1863-02-05">February 5, 1863.</date> I incline to think, however, that if the proper authority fail or refuse to organize a Board of Exemption the party claiming his exemption would be entitled to have the question tried upon <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus, </hi> without being obliged to await the result of a mandamus to compel the organization of a board. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> Something has been said in the argument about the authority for putting the militia into camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>I think it was competent to the <rs type="role" reg="commanding-Officer">commanding officer</rs> to order the men into camp, if, in his judgment it was necessary to proper discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>And I may remark, that this objection confesses that the men have not been turned over to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> and incorporated into their army, for if so there is no room for doubt that their proper place is in camp. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> I, therefore, remand the petitioner to the custody of <persName n="Davenport,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Davenport,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Davenport</surname></persName>, and adjudge him to pay the costs of the proceedings. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> I dismiss the writ against <persName n="Jenkins,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Jenkins,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jenkins</surname></persName>, and adjudge the petitioner to pay the cost of the proceedings in that case. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> Common'lth for <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, <lb/> <hi rend="italics">ve,</hi> <lb/> <persName n="Davenport,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Davenport,nomatch:0"><surname>Davenport</surname></persName>, <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Corpus,,Habeas,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="default:Corpus,Habeas,,,"><foreName>Habeas</foreName> <surname>Corpus</surname></persName>.</hi> </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> In the argument this case was considered as standing on the same ground with <persName n="Raines,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Raines,nomatch:0"><surname>Raines</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>But counsel were mistaken in supposing that <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> furnished a substitute in the <rs>Confederate</rs> service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>His substitute was put into the <rs>State</rs> service on the <date value="1862-04-04">4th April, 1862,</date> before there was any law of Congress allowing substitutes in the <rs>Confederate</rs> service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> This substitution appears from the papers to have been a good <num value="1">one</num>, under the laws of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, the substitute being a non-resident of the <rs>State</rs>, a native of <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName>, and never authorized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>I know our army needs recruits, and for this and other reasons I regret a decision which stands in the way of a prompt and cheerful movement to fill up the thinned ranks of our regiments. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> New York never paused in her efforts to send volunteers to the assistance of our gallant soldiers in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Active exertions are now being made to organize new and fill up the old regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>These exertion will be more successful if the draft is suspended, and much better than reluctant conscripts will be in the armies. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>I answered accordingly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>In doing so I laid down the principle to which I purpose adhering, which is to proceed with the draft, at the same time employing infallible measures to avoid any great wrong. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/> Again we are brought to the conclusion that the main and final contest must be between the <num value="2">two</num> capitals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>What else can they attempt?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>And of course they are not going to give up the contest without making yet a last grand desperate effort to save themselves &mdash; not without exhausting <hi rend="italics">all</hi> of their resources, physical and strategic. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/> * * * * * </p>
