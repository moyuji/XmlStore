<head>Attempt to cross the <rs>Rapidan</rs> &mdash; the enemy driven back.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> Yesterday morning a report was received by the <rs>Central</rs> cars that <orgName n="army"><persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><surname>Meade</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> had crossed the <placeName key="tgn,1129009" n="1.000 31" reg="rapidan, virginia, united states">Rapidan river</placeName> at <placeName reg="Morton's ford">Morton's</placeName>, <placeName reg="Somerville ford">Somerville</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Raccoon Ford, Culpeper, Virginia" key="tgn,2113825">Raccoon Fords</placeName> in large force.--This report subsequently proved untrue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>By the train yesterday evening we get the following facts of the affair, which gave rise, doubtless, to the report mentioned: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> about daylight the enemy appeared in large force at <placeName reg="Morton's Ford">Morton's Ford</placeName> and commenced crossing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>They crossed a considerable body of men and then stopped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>As they apparently intended to send over no more just then, our forces attacked those already across, and after a short fight drove them back to the other side.--The affair was a short and almost bloodless <num value="1">one</num>, our loss being reported at <measure n="1" type="killed">one killed</measure> and <measure n="3" type="wounded">three wounded</measure>. It was of such short duration that the troops engaged in it were back in their old camp by <time value="4pm">4 o'clock P. M.</time>, preparing supper. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> At the same time that the demonstration was made at <placeName reg="Morton's Ford">Morton's Ford</placeName> the enemy appeared at <placeName key="tgn,2113825" n="1.000 35" reg="raccoon ford, culpeper, virginia">Raccoon Ford</placeName> and planted a battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>A brisk fire was opened, which was replied to by the <rs>Confederates</rs>, and in a short time the fire from the other side of the river ceased. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> <num value="5">Five</num> or <measure n="6" type="prisoners">six prisoners</measure>, captured in the skirmish at <placeName reg="Morton's Ford">Morton's Ford</placeName>, were brought down on the <rs>Central</rs> train last night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>They speak of <orgName n="army"><persName n="Meade,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Meade,nomatch:0"><surname>Meade</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> having been much strengthened, and say that he has a &#x0022;big lot&#x0022; of men with him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> Up to <time value="11oclock">11 o'clock</time> <time>yesterday</time> there had been no renewal of the attempt to cross by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> and no further fighting. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> The <orgName n="New Orleans Era" type="newspaper">New Orleans <hi rend="italics">Era</hi></orgName>, of the <num value="4" type="ordinal">4th</num>, states that the <rs>Confederates</rs> attacked <persName n="Washburn,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Washburn,nomatch:0"><surname>Washburn</surname></persName>'s advance on the <num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num> inst, driving it towards the main body.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The Confederates were soon checked, it is said, and in turn were driven back, with the loss of <measure n="200" type="prisoners">200 prisoners</measure>. The Federal loss was <measure n="40" type="killed">forty killed</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> The good weather continues, and the roads have improved very much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The nights are cold and frosty, and the days bright and sunny, with just enough of sharpness in the atmosphere to render exercise pleasant and to make <num value="1">one</num> feel as if he would enjoy a march of <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <measure n="20miles" type="distance">twenty miles</measure> over the frozen roads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>It is not probable that <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName> and <persName n="Thomas,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName> will fall to avail themselves of the good weather, if either of them contemplates active operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>We know that <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, Who commands the <rs>Federal</rs> auxiliary <orgName n="Army of the Tennessee" type="army">Army of the Tennessee</orgName>, has reached <placeName reg="Huntsville, Madison, Alabama" key="tgn,7013732">Huntsville</placeName>, on his way to join the <orgName n="Army of the Cumberland" type="army">Army of the Cumberland</orgName>, at <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>He undertook to repair the <orgName n="Memphis and Charleston Railroad" type="railroad">Memphis and Charleston Railroad</orgName> as he advanced; but the destruction of the track by <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s and <orgName n="cavalry"><persName n="Roddy,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Roddy,nomatch:0"><surname>Roddy</surname></persName>'s cavalry</orgName>, who fell back before him, was so complete that he finally abandoned the work, crossed the <placeName key="tgn,2715022" n="1.000 335" reg="tennessee river, united states, north and central america">Tennessee river</placeName> at <placeName reg="Florence, Lauderdale, Alabama" key="tgn,7013767">Florence</placeName>, and marched across the country to <placeName reg="Huntsville, Madison, Alabama" key="tgn,7013732">Huntsville</placeName>, where he had arrived at our last advices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>By adopting this plan he will be able to reach <placeName reg="Bridgeport, Cocke, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098103">Bridgeport</placeName> sooner than was anticipated at the time I last referred to his movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Indeed, it is now believed that he will succeed in forming a junction with <persName n="Thomas,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="nearbymention:Thomas,George,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName> by the end of the present month, soon after which it is not improbable that a forward-movement will be undertaken, with the hope, it may be, of occupying the country lying <name>north</name> and <name>west</name> of the west branch of the <rs>Chickamauga</rs>, preparatory to an invasion of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> early next spring. --Should such be the expectation of the enemy we have no fears that <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> will be able to join in the movement this winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/><persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName> has already taken steps to completely checkmate the <rs>Federals</rs> in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>This they know by this time quite as well as we do. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> Reference was made in my last letter to the condition of the horses in this army, and to the accessibly of exercising care and economy in the use of them, especially in view of the large numbers that have been destroyed during the war and of the present limited supply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>This necessity grows stronger every day, being in proportion to the loss of animal in the service, the further contraction of our available territory, and the rapid deterioration of our railways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Every possible effort should be made, therefore, to preserve the horses we have and to increase the stock; and, to this end, teamsters, artillerists, cavalrymen, and all those persons having horses in the service, should be required to take as good care of them as possible, while all broad mares should be exempted from impressment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>If necessary, orders to this effect should be issued from the <orgName n="War Office" type="office">War Office</orgName>, and all mounted officers instructed to see that they are obeyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>In the meantime, every facility should be extended to farmers and others who may desire to engage in the business of raising horses and mules. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> An impressment of horses for this army was recently ordered in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The horses were much needed at the time, but could not the demand have been supplied from other sources, and that, too, without increasing the number of horses to be fed?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The custom prevails in this army of allowing all general officers above brigadiers to have escorts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>There is <num value="1">one</num> <rs type="role" reg="Major-General">Major General</rs> who is reported to have an escort of <num value="40">forty</num> mounted men, and another <num value="1">one</num> an escort of <num value="125">one hundred and twenty-five</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>A <rs type="role" reg="Lieutenant-General">Lieut.-General</rs> who was lately here is said to have had an escort twice as numerous as the latter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Some have <num value="1">one</num> number, and some another, according to their fancy or vanity, as you please.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>In other words, we have Bashaws with <num value="1">one</num> tail, and Bashaws with <num value="2">two</num> talls, and Bashaws with <num value="3">three</num> talls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>These cavalcades have their regular officers, and consequently we hear of &#x0022;<rs type="role" reg="Major">Majors</rs> of Horse&#x0022; and &#x0022;<rs type="role" reg="Captain">Captains</rs> of Horse&#x0022; --officers wholly unknown to the law. Indeed, so universal has this practice become that <num value="1">one</num> seldom meets an officer riding alone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Nearly all of them have <num value="1">one</num> or more orderlies following after them, including captains and majors of artillery, quartermasters, commissaries, &#x0026;c. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> The <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs> is entitled to and requires an escort, especially in time of battle, when it is necessary for him to communicate frequently with all parts of the field; but no other officer not exercising a separate command does need an escort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Why then should not these kites be shorn of their talls, these gentry dismounted, and trusty muskets placed in their hands, and their horses turned over to the artillery companies and the <orgName n="Quartermaster Department" type="department">Quartermaster's Department</orgName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>Such caudal appendages are of no sort of use, either to the officers who fly them or to the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>On the contrary, the horses have to be fed, and their riders subsisted and paid, just as at they rendered the most valuable service; while wagons and teams, which might otherwise be profitably employed, are required to transport their supplies and camp equipment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Indeed, they are an offence in the eyes of the brave men who for nearly <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> have carried their muskets, and our cause itself, upon their heroic shoulders &mdash; a scandalous exhibition of military vanity, which, though pardonable under some circumstances, is wholly out of place at a time like this. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> Instead, therefore, of ordering the late impressment of horses, it would have been wiser to have dismounted these gentry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Such escorts are unknown in the <orgName n="Army of Northern Virginia" type="army">army of Northern Virginia</orgName>. <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen'l</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> alone in the army has an escort &mdash; a small <num value="1">one</num>--which never goes with him except in battle, when the men are used as couriers; all other <rs type="role" reg="General-Officer">General officers</rs> are restricted to the legal number of orderly, or couriers as we call them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>If the reform were carried still further, and officers were restricted to <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> horses at most, it would be all the better; not merely because the number of horses is rapidly diminishing, but on account of the limited supply of forage and means of transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>It is no longer a matter of choice but necessity. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> I am glad to add, upon the authority of <num value="1">one</num> likely to be well informed, that the matter of the supply of horses is already engaging the attention of <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName>. </p> <closer> <signed>Nellroe.</signed> </closer> </div3> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> papers are raising a great outcry over the reported plot of the &#x0022;rebel&#x0022; sympathizers in <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName> to capture <placeName reg="Buffalo, Erie, New York" key="tgn,7013463">Buffalo</placeName>, release the <rs>Confederate</rs> prisoners, and burn the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>For our own part, we do not believe <num value="1">one</num> word of the story, although attested by <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Lyons</foreName></persName> in his official capacity, and taken for granted by <persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00257" reg="mostcommon:Stanton,nomatch:0"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>We believe it to be a mare's nest, existing only in the weak fancy of the <rs>British</rs> ambassador and his informants in <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>It afforded a rare opportunity, however for <persName n="Lyons,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00258" reg="mostcommon:Lyons,nomatch:0"><surname>Lyons</surname></persName> to manifest his zeal for the cause of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Doodle, and his hatred of the &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">so-called</hi>&#x0022; <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States of America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>The tool of <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00259" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName>, as <persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00260" reg="mostcommon:Russell,nomatch:0"><surname>Russell</surname></persName> himself is the tool of <persName n="Adams,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00261" reg="mostcommon:Adams,nomatch:0"><surname>Adams</surname></persName>, there was every temptation for him to give easy faith to, if he did not actually <hi rend="italics">invent,</hi> the whole story.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>Our opinion is, that he <hi rend="italics">invented</hi> it for his own purposes, and those of his Government, which just now is completely under the control of the <rs>Government</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>The existence of such a plot is an improbability so monstrous that scarcely any degree of proof would be sufficient to establish it, and as yet we have seen no proof worthy of the name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/><placeName reg="Johnson Island, Ottawa, Ohio" key="tgn,2424997">Johnson's Island</placeName> is in <placeName reg="Lake Erie, United States" key="tgn,2318573">Lake Erie</placeName>. <placeName reg="Lake Eric">Lake Eric</placeName> is navigated by a vast number of armed <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> vessels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>If such a plot actually existed, and should succeed in liberating the captives, the <name>States</name> of New York, <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>--a crowded and hostile country swarming with soldiers &mdash; lie between them and the nearest State of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>How could they possibly make their way through such a country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>Should they, in despair of reaching their own country, turn to <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>, they know well enough that they would not be protected there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>Far from it, the <rs>British Government</rs> would make a merit of delivering them up, let the law upon the subject be what it might.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>It would be a most acceptable offering to <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00262" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName>, and would probably have the effect of diminishing the number of distributes in which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> papers habitually indulge with regard to <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> and her Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>The whole story is incredible, and is, we firmly believe, a mere figment of <persName n="Lyons,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00263" reg="mostcommon:Lyons,nomatch:0"><surname>Lyons</surname></persName> and his correspondents. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/> The English Foreign <rs type="role2">Secretary</rs> could not have fallen upon a man better suited to his purposes than the present <rs type="role" reg="Minister Plenipotentiary">Minister Plenipotentiary</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>His hatred of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> is on a level with his sycophancy to <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00264" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00265" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>A narrow understanding and a cold heart peculiarly fit him to play the tool of a despotism, and he plays it with a zest which shows that he is in his element, and feels it. By this pretended exposure of a plot he aggravates immeasurably the hardships which our unfortunate countrymen are enduring in their terrible captivity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>He knows that well enough, but he does not shrink from the task before him. Had the case been reversed &mdash; had the prisoners been <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and the prison a Confederate prison &mdash; doubtless his ears would not have been so acute, or his tongue so ready to denounce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>But the prisoners are mere rebels in his eyes &mdash; his Government, or the head of it, or the <rs>Minister</rs> who writes the <rs>Queen</rs>'s speeches, has already called it a &#x0022;civil war, &#x0022; in spite of all the information furnished by <persName n="Yancey,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00266" reg="mostcommon:Yancey,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Yancey</surname></persName> and <persName n="Slidell,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00267" reg="mostcommon:Slidell,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Slidell</surname></persName>, thus taking the decision of the question into its own hands &mdash; and therefore no mercy was to be expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>It may have been his miserable duty to denounce the plot and the plotters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>But would it not have been a little more consistent with humanity to have <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> ascertained its existence?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>In the meantime, we do not maintain that a plot laid by Confederate prisoners in the middle of <placeName reg="Lake Erie, United States" key="tgn,2318573">Lake Erie</placeName>, surrounded by <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> ships of war, in conjunction with persons in <placeName reg="Canada, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName> &mdash; disclosed by <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Lyons</foreName></persName>, and punished by <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00268" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> &mdash; has more the air of an ill-gotten up farce than anything that even the unassisted genius of Yankeedom has yet brought out. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>For <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure> have the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> been hurling upon its fortifications a hurricane of the most tremendous missiles ever used in warfare, and for <measure n="4months" type="date">four months</measure> have they been met and baffled by a devotion and heroism which they cannot equal nor overcome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>The failure of their combined military and naval operations to accomplish their object covers them with humiliation and disgrace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>We believe they have done their worst, and whether they have or not, <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> bids them defiance and laughs them to scorn.
