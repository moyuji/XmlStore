<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The route taken by the writer was the old <address><street n="Warrenton Turnpike">Warrenton Turnpike</street></address>, over the ford at <placeName reg="Cub Run, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2270910">Cub Run</placeName>, the identical spot where the famous <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> stampede look place <date value="07-21">July 21st,</date> last year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> The ambulances, preceded by the white flag, and accompanied by an unarmed cavalry escort, wound deviously down the broken slope into the <rs type="place">Run</rs>, overlooked by a platoon of Southern cavalry &mdash; the pickets of their army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>But a short distance from the river large bodies of their horsemen came in sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The <orgName type="regiment" key="VA1">1st Virginia</orgName> was halting alongside the road &mdash; a fine body of men, evidently all of the better order of Southern society, well mounted, well armed, handsome, resolute looking fellows, their gray dress in better condition than that of the infantry, but very much varied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Some were in citizens clothes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Besides these, the road was filled with their straggles, among whom the <name>North</name> and <name>South</name> <rs n="Carolinian" type="group">Carolinians</rs> were decidedly the worse looking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The signs of battle were here painfully evident, dead soldiers lay stark in the road and along side the bank; dead horses filling the air with carrion smell added to the horror of the place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>At the stone-house used at the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> as well as this battle as a hospital, was a large pile of muskets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>In the neighboring fields, strewed with dead horses, were also stray caissons, limbers, and cannons, here a Parrot gun, there a blither, while away to the right a battery of <num value="5">five</num> <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Napoleon,nomatch:0"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> twelves was pointed out as having been taken in the last fight. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> Soon the battle-field could be seen thickly dotted with carcases of horses and bodies of men. Not less than <measure n="2500" type="killed and wounded">2,500 killed and wounded</measure> were lost here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>In the rear of these fields, in a little orchard where the enemy took the <placeName reg="Napoleon, Henry, Ohio" key="tgn,2080924">Napoleon</placeName> battery, the flag of truce halted. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> After a little delay the citizens, to the number of <num value="30">30</num>, formed a line by themselves, and the soldiers who had been detailed to accompany the expedition to bury the dead, made up another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The latter went off in details to perform their duty, and the civilians, in squads of <num value="8">eight</num>, accompanied the ambulances, carrying stretchers, upon which they have placed the wounded as fast as they found them, and carried them to the ambulances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Attracted by the red bags of <orgName n="Duryca's ZouaveVolunteer"><persName n="Duryca,ZouaveVolunteer,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Duryca,nomatch:0"><roleName n="ZouaveVolunteer"></roleName><surname>Duryca</surname></persName>'s Zouaves</orgName> we proceeded to the field where they lay &mdash; nearly a <num value="100">hundred</num> of them &mdash; sheltered, torn, and bloody, in every conceivable stage of misery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Exhaustion had been the cause of death with some whose wounds were not otherwise mortal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/><num value="1">One</num> man still clutched the earth as in the last struggle for breath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Another, a tall, square browed, <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> faced hero, prone on his back, had his face turned to the sky in marble repose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>By his side a mere boy laid, as if in death he had sought the protection of the stalwart arm which had befriended his weaker nature in life. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> All this was very sad; but some of the horrors of that place are almost nameless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The blackened, shattered corpses it is horrible even to think of. As for the wounded, their case was infinitely worse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Away from help, on the bloody ground where they fell, dying by inches, to many recovery was impossible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Although the stragglers of the rebel army had taken shoes and clothing from the dead, and even from the living, none had been ill-treated; on the contrary, all spoke with gratitude of the manner in which they had been supplied with water, and even with a little corn bread, when their victors, half starved themselves, could spare it &mdash; They had even had a number of them collected at different spots to facilitate their attendance and removal, and when called upon to help, never refused, but voluntarily came forward and expressed a desire to do all they could for us. The ambulances were soon filled and started for the orchard rendezvous; not, however, before a violation of the flag of truce by some Southern men who look <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> colored drivers off their scats. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> An <name>English</name> gentleman, present as a volunteer, made a strong remonstrance in the case of a free colored man of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, whom a scoundrel in citizen's clothing, with a <rs type="role2">Major</rs>'s star on the collar of his greasy coat, had claimed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>This man, dismounting from his horse, after remarking that he did not care whether the negro was a slave or no, took him by the collar, and, with the words <q>&#x0022;I'll make a slave of you, and a slave you are from this moment,&#x0022;</q> dealt him a flat handed blow on the cheek, which drew a rush of tears from the eyes of the trembling wretch. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> The rest of the rebels looked on approvingly, and the fellow turned to the <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishman</rs> and asked him what he had to say to that?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The reply that the flag of truce recognizes as sacred all beneath its folds, and that he had grossly violated it, made not the least impression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Other officers of the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>, to whom remonstrance was made, utterly disclaimed such proceedings, and said that <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, to whom they would report the outrage, would doubtless return the negroes, <hi rend="italics">if he could find them.</hi> Several of the civilians were robbed and others made prisoners; but this last was their own fault, as they straggled away on their individual responsibility in search of trophies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> On returning to the headquarters, in the orchard, we found the doctors hard at work, operating on the wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>It was noticed that some of the surgeons, not being appointed on the amputation detail, looked with contempt on minor wounds, and walked about doing nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/><num value="1">One</num> of them sported a black eye, gained in a quarrel over the wounded, and <num value="1">one</num>, at least, was tipsy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The best management did not prevail, but it is considered a standing rule in the army for correspondents to wink at all shortcomings, as otherwise it might tend to throw odium on those who deserve it and are responsible for failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The afternoon passed, and no arrangements were made for carrying the wounded within the lines, but blankets were not wanting to cover them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Large fires were made, around which the party, now tired out, was soon grouped, wondering how they should pass the night without blankets or shelter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>It soon began to rain heavily; the wounded were crowded inside some barns and a farmhouse near by till no more could be got in, and the rest had to pass the night on the ground, rolled in blankets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Till a late hour the doctors continued their work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The body of a dead man, shot in <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>'s fight, which laid on the porch, and smelt offensive, was buried by <num value="3">three</num> citizens by the light of candles, under some trees alongside the house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>A miserable night &mdash; rain and then a strong, cold <name>North</name> wind, was finally succeeded by dawn, when work began again; fetching water for the wounded, dressing and amputating, filling into the carriages, and distributing the few spoonfuls of beef soup in camp.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Not staying for the main body, a small party of us started for <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName> by way of the <rs type="place">Stone Bridge</rs>, seeing very little of the <name>Secession</name> army, now well on its way by the <rs type="place">Guilford</rs> and <address><street n="Gum Spring road">Gum Spring roads</street></address> to the <rs>Upper Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>On reaching <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName>, we found only <num value="1">one</num> company of the <orgName type="regiment" key="50GAVolunteer">50th Georgia volunteers</orgName> present, acting as <orgName n="Provost Guard" type="guard">Provost guard</orgName> in the village.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>They were making themselves happy with the liquors and other medical steres left in the place; and were a lank, lean, hard looking set of half starved fellows, in light flannel colored dress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Their <rs type="role2">Captain</rs> gave us passes to the <rs>Union</rs> lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>He looked a cunning fellow enough, and bad more whiskey in him than appeared at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sight; still he was decidedly in good temper with himself, his position, his dirty gang, and all the world.--While waiting, we had an opportunity to see the operation of relieving guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>It would have made a Northern soldier open his eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>The <rs>Sergeant</rs> brought the relief up <num value="1">one</num> at a time, and would say, <q>&#x0022;<persName n="Brown,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="nearbymention:Brown,John,,,"><surname>Brown</surname></persName>, <persName n="Jones,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Jones,nomatch:0"><surname>Jones</surname></persName> relieves you now, and is to stay here till the <rs>Captain</rs> send, some <num value="1">one</num> else.&#x0022;</q> <persName n="Brown,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="nearbymention:Brown,John,,,"><surname>Brown</surname></persName>, apparently uncertain, remains on post.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/><rs type="role2">Sergeant</rs> takes his arm and leads him off a little distance, but seeing a man relieving another on his own hook, leaves B. to go and look into it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/> We also left, and esteemed ourselves in luck to find some crackers, thrown down and wasted by the retreating Union army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>From these we selected the cleanest, and again went on, the <rs>Georgian</rs> pickets demanding our passes a short distance from <placeName reg="Centreville, Fairfax, Virginia" key="tgn,2111026">Centreville</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>When about <placeName><distance reg="4miles">four miles</distance> from <persName n="Fairfax,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Fairfax,nomatch:0"><surname>Fairfax</surname></persName></placeName> we met <persName n="Clark,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Clark,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <surname>Clark</surname></persName>, of the <orgName type="regiment" key="MA21">21st Massachusetts</orgName>, and <num value="4">four</num> privates, all unarmed, seeking to get within the <rs>Union</rs> lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>It would have been easy to have added his name to the list with the flag, but honor forbade the use. The best that could be done was to direct him as nearly as could be judged in what position the rebel force was least likely to be found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>His regiment had been surprised by the <name>Georgians</name>, who approached the guards declaring their intention to surrender, till they were close enough for their purpose, when they suddenly attacked and dispersed the <rs>Massachusetts</rs> men, making a number prisoners and cutting up the rest badly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>The <rs>Colonel</rs>, hungry, tired, and in want of sleep, was, as well as his men, determined not to give up if possible, and left us making his way rapidly southwards, previously accepting the offer of <num value="2">two</num> crackers from <num value="1">one</num> of the party, which was all we had. It is not yet Known whether <persName n="Clark,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Clark,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Clark</surname></persName> finally escaped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>His chances were certainly very doubtful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>It was a sad spectacle in its way to see the proud commander of a <num value="1000">thousand</num> men reduced to the society of <num value="4">four</num> poor followers, without any distinction but what habit gave, and all equally hunted and forced back at every turn by the counting enemy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/> After this, to our great relief, we soon fell in with the last of the rebel soldier &mdash; a picket of cavalry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>They seemed somewhat astonished at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and <num value="2">two</num> of them rode out towards us. As usual with their <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> mounted men, they were ulterior follows, physically, much more so than the infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>The passes were examined, the men grouped about quietly with <persName n="Sharp,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Sharp,nomatch:0"><surname>Sharp</surname></persName>'s carbines, in rest &mdash; probably taken from our cavalry, who, <hi rend="italics">en passant,</hi> are too prone to throw their arms away. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/> The officer of the picket declared us correct, and remarked that we should find our lines about a <measure n="1000yards" type="distance">thousand yards</measure> from us, adding that they had been exchanging shots all day. </p> </q><bibl n="The New York Tribune"></bibl></cit> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/> What must be the feelings of a man who is fighting the battiest of his country, surrendering all the comforts and endearments of home, submitting to all the sufferings and sacrifices of camp life and active military duty, when he (receiving, but <measure n="11dollars" type="currency">$11</measure> per month) is informed that a sack of salt costs <measure n="50dollars" type="currency">$50</measure>, or a pair of lady's shoes cost <measure n="16dollars" type="currency">$16</measure>, with every thing else in proportion?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/> There is but <num value="1">one</num> remedy for this evil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>It is to increase the quantities of the articles upon which the extortion operates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>The general law of trade, that the supply must equal the demand, is the only law by which trade can be regulated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>When the supply equals the demand, the price will be commensurate with the value of the article.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="415"/>When the supply is deficient, the price will be immediately enhanced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>It becomes necessary, then, to turn attention to the means requisite for increasing supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>This can be accomplished, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, by prohibiting the agents of the <rs>Government</rs> who have control of the lines of transportation from receiving remuneration for giving preferences in transporting articles, by which the extortioners who pay the largest douceurs are these only who are accommodated; and secondly, by obtaining an order from the <rs>Government</rs> authorizing the transportation of produce to the exclusion of other things, at least <num value="1">one</num> day in each week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="418"/>If this were done, the equilibrium so necessary in trade would restore prices to their natural standard. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="419"/> Whatever can be done by the <name>Legislature</name> for the relief of the people from the evils visited upon them by the extortioners, I feel persuaded will be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>The evil has become more serious and alarming, and is increasing daily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>I hope the <name>Legislature</name> will direct their attention to this matter, and see whether their combined wisdom cannot devise some measures that will give relief to a suffering people. </p> </div4>
