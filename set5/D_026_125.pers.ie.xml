<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> Many rumors were in circulation yesterday, of an exaggerated character, concerning an affair with the enemy in <placeName reg="Charles City, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1002257">Charles City county</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>On application at head quarters last night we learned the following facts: On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time> a portion of <persName n="Lee,General,Fitz,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="default:Lee,Fitz,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <foreName>Fitz</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s <orgName n="cavalry">cavalry</orgName> moved into <placeName reg="Charles City, Charles City, Virginia" key="tgn,2111055">Charles City</placeName> on a reconnaissance and found the enemy, negroes and whites, under command of <persName n="Wild,Brigadier-General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Wild,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Brigadier-General">Brigadier General</roleName> <surname>Wild</surname></persName>, <num value="1">one</num> of the most infamous of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> commanders, near <persName n="Kennon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Kennon,nomatch:0"><surname>Kennon</surname></persName>'s, shout <placeName><distance reg="40miles">forty miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName></placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>They were strongly entrenched, having a wide ditch in front protected by abattis, and for cavalry to attack them in such a position, was, to say the least of it, a hazardous experiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>In the skirmish which ensued, our men lost some <num value="16">sixteen</num> or <measure n="18" type="wounded">eighteen wounded</measure>, and, finding that the enemy had every advantage, retired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Probably the <rs>Northern</rs> journals will raise a great shout over this affair, as an evidence of the &#x0022;valor&#x0022; of the negro troops, who, in fact, have only distinguished themselves in <placeName reg="Charles City, Charles City, Virginia" key="tgn,2111055">Charles City</placeName> thus far by the outrageous excesses committed on the defenceless inhabitants. </p> </div4> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>For our own part, we cannot seriously entertain any fears about the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>Anxiety we certainly feel &mdash; we should be the most callous of mortals if we did not &mdash; but, as for any serious doubt, we have none.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>This is the pervading sentiment among our citizens at this moment, who, while they necessarily feel the pain of suspense on an occasion so momentous, yet place the firmest confidence in the army and in <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00266" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Filz,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, and do not believe it within the power of the enemy to prevail against them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/> From a number of concurring circumstances, from the testimony of many eminent officers, and intelligent soldiers, from the issue of the battles in <placeName reg="Spotsylvania, Spotsylvania, Virginia" key="tgn,2114316">Spotsylvania</placeName>, and the explicitly declared opinion of <num value="1">one</num> whom we are not at liberty to mention, but whose judgment, were his name known, would be pronounced decisive, we are induced to believe that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00267" reg="nearbymention:Grant,F.,M.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s enormous losses have brought his force down to a numerical equality with those of our own army. --<persName n="Stanton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00268" reg="mostcommon:Stanton,nomatch:0"><surname>Stanton</surname></persName>, we are told, telegraphs the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> press that he has sent on reinforcements to the amount of <num value="25000">25,000</num> veterans; but we believe this statement to be a gross exaggeration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>If he had really sent on <num value="25000">25,000</num>, he would have telegraphed that he had sent on <num value="50000">50,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>But where was he to get <num value="25000">25,000</num> veterans?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>He had already stripped <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, and all the <rs>Northern</rs> cities of their garrisons, and their places had been filled by militia.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>He had already drawn from <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248"><rs type="direction">Northern</rs> Georgia</placeName> all the men that could possibly be spared.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>He could get no men from New Orleans, or from any point west of the <rs>Mississippi</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/><persName n="Taylor,,Dick,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00269" reg="default:Taylor,Dick,,,"><foreName>Dick</foreName> <surname>Taylor</surname></persName> has laid an embargo upon the whole <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> force in that quarter, and will not let them come on. By abandoning <placeName reg="New Bern, Craven, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014197">Newbern</placeName>, he might relieve a brigade or <num value="2">two</num>; but he could hardly obtain <num value="23000">23,000</num> men. In our opinion, if he has added <num value="10000">10,000</num> <hi rend="italics">veterans</hi> to <orgName n="army"><persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00270" reg="nearbymention:Grant,F.,M.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> since the battle, it is the most that he has done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/><measure n="90days" type="date">Ninety days</measure> men and raw militia &mdash; the sweepings of the streets of the great cities &mdash; he may have sent onto the tune of <num value="25000">25,000</num>; but they will prove a poor reliance in the hour of danger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>We know nothing of the numbers sent to <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00271" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Filz,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, but we do know that, be they as great or as small as they may, they are good troops, worthy to stand side by side with any that over drew a ramrod. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/> The numbers of the <num value="2">two</num> armies, then, we take to be nearly equal; but they are unequal in everything else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are cowed, broken spirited, and hopeless, from the result of the late battles, in which they saw that no superiority of numbers could prevail over the superior valor of our troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>The Confederates are buoyant, hopeful, eager for the fray, confident of victory, and anxious to begin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="375"/>They have been in the habit of beating the boasted <orgName n="Army of the Potomac" type="army">army of the Potomac</orgName> when they numbered <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> to <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/>They feel no doubt of their ability to beat them now when they are not greatly more numerous than themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>It is for these reasons that we entertain no fears of the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/>On the contrary, we feel assured that it will be in our favor, and if <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00272" reg="nearbymention:Grant,F.,M.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> is badly defeated here he is a lost man.
