<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/> The operation of the various laws now in force for raising armies, has exhibited the necessity for reform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>The frequent changes and amendments which have been made, have rendered the system so complicated as to make it often quite difficult to determine what the law really is, and to what extent prior amendments are modified by more recent regulation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/> There is also embarrassment from conflict between State and Confederate legislation.--I am happy to assure you of the entire harmony of purpose and cordiality of feeling which has continued to exist between myself and the <name>Executives</name> of the several States; and it is to this cause that our success in keeping adequate forces in the field is to be attributed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/> These reasons would suffice for inviting your earnest attention to the necessity of some sample and general system for exercising the power of raising armies, which as vested in the <rs>Congress</rs> by the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>But there is another and more important consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>The vast preparations made by the enemy for a combined assault at numerous points on our frontier and seaboard have produced the result that might have been expected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>They have animated the people with a spirit of resistance so general, so resolute, and so self-sacrificing, that it requires rather to be regulated than to be eliminated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>The right of the <rs>State</rs> to demand, and the duty of each citizen to render, military, service, need only to be stated to be admitted.--It is not, however, wise or judicious policy to place involve service that portion of the force of a people which experience has shown to be necessary as a reserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>Youths under the age of <measure n="18years" type="date">18 years</measure> require further instruction; men of matured, experience and needed for maintaining order and good government at home, and in supervising preparations for rendering efficient the armies in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>These <num value="2">two</num> classes constitute the proper reserve for home defence, ready to be called out in case of emergency, and to be kept in the field only while the emergency exists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>But in order to maintain this reserve intact, it is necessary that in, a great war like that in which we are now engaged, all persons of intermediate ages not legally exempt for good cause, should pay their debt of military service to the country, that the burthens should not fall exclusively on the most ardent and patriotic. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/> I therefore recommend the passage of a law declaring that all persons residing within the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, between the ages of <num value="18">eighteen</num> and <measure n="35years" type="date">thirty five years</measure>, and rightfully subject to military duty, shall be held to be in the military service of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, and that some plain and simple method be adopted for their prompt enrollment and organization, repealing all of the legislation therefore enacted which would conflict with the system proposed. </p> </q><bibl n="The President"></bibl></cit>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/> --Dear Sirs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>The emergencies of the present hour demand that every fact and probability, bearing upon the unequal contest in which the <rs>Confederacy</rs> is now engaged, be thoroughly considered, in order that the greatest possible economy may be attained in the use and disposition of the comparatively scanty resources of the country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/> The ever whelming numbers which the <rs>Federals</rs> can, and do throw rapidly upon any given point of attack, must be met not by corresponding numbers, but with weapons of defence which will make the few of the <orgName n="Confederate Forces" type="org">Confederate forces</orgName> equal if not out balance them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>This may be accomplished by the use of the small breech-loading gun lately exhibited on the <rs type="place">Capitol Square</rs> by a refugee from <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="523"/>It find a vacuum hitherto existing between <orgName n="Field Artillery" type="artillery">field artillery</orgName> and the infantry weapons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="524"/>This gun is capable of being used as a mounted rifle to destroy artillery horses at great distances, or, with smooth bore, to throw buckshot in the face of an assaulting party at the rate of from <num value="20">twenty</num> to <num value="30">thirty</num> discharges per minute, spreading them some <num value="30">thirty</num> to <measure n="50feet" type="distance">fifty feet</measure> at the distance of some <num value="2">two</num> to <measure n="300yards" type="distance">three hundred yards</measure>. And I ask what assaulting party could face the continued stream of buckshot that <num value="3">three</num> of these small guns, which had been properly planted in each battery, could pour upon them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="525"/>Depend upon it, sir, each of these guns are equal to <num value="1000">one thousand</num> muskets, though they be handled by the most brave and thoroughly disciplined troops. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="526"/> Again: These guns can be manufactured at small cost, and very rapidly, which is a very important consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="527"/>They require only a <num value="2">two</num> wheeled carriage, and are manned and managed thoroughly by jour men. In a retreat they are the most effective weapon that can be used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="528"/>for they can be fired in the face of the pursuer without halting at all, and quite as rapidly as if in battery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/> I hope the ladies of the <q>&#x0022;National Defence Association&#x0022;</q> will consider whether they would not more effectually accomplish their most desirable object by devoting their contributions to the building of these guns, and <hi rend="italics">thus increasing the effective force of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> <num value="100">one hundred</num> fold by the time they can get the keel of a gunboat laid.</hi> Remember, you must whip the enemy on land, and take your time to equal him on the water. </p>
