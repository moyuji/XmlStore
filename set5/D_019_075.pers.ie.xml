<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>They thus acted as mediators, and saved the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The point he made, as the reporter understood it, was that if wise counsels could prevail, a similar result would follow the present efforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>He preserved the line of argument and illustration with which all are familiar who have listened to his campaign speeches. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/> A reference, he said, had been made to his gestures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The main-spring of his action was Union, and it was the glory of the <rs>Union</rs> that gave force to his action here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>When he saw a man stand off and carefully arrange a mass of papers before him, and proceed to bring forth a string of abstractions that would craze a philosopher to investigate, he thought that such a man was not the statesman nor the lawyer for him. He proceeded then to argue the question of secession, reading evidence from speeches of <persName n="Rhett,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00031" reg="mostcommon:Rhett,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Rhett</surname></persName> and others in the <orgName n="Southern Convention" type="convention">Southern Convention</orgName>, to show that Southern men had been endeavoring for years to bring about a dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs>.--He would not say that they were pulling with the abolitionists, in couples, but that they were striving for the same object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>He alluded also to the course of <persName n="Wise,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00033" reg="mostcommon:Wise,O.,Jennings,,:4"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName> in battling for the <rs>Union</rs> on that occasion, and he thought it would be well for the people of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, with this record before them, to follow such suggestions and advice now. He would take up the weapons with which the member from <placeName key="tgn,2110227" n="1.000 5" reg="accomac, accomack, virginia">Accomac</placeName> fought disunion in <dateStruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></dateStruct>, and fight it to the very death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>He predicted that the ballot-box would send forth a sound that would strike unmitigated sorrow to the hearts of secessionists in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, if it did not cover them with shame.

He went from this branch of his subject to the consideration of the grandeur of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Republic, and its position before the world, and, among other striking figures of speech, asked if they wanted the icy arms of death to encircle the fair form of the <name>Goddess</name> of Liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>He quoted a considerable portion of the speech of <persName n="Wise,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00035" reg="mostcommon:Wise,O.,Jennings,,:4"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName> in Congress in <dateStruct value="1842--"><year reg="1842">1842</year></dateStruct>, upon the anti-slavery petition, and used it after the manner of seizing an enemy's guns and turning them against himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>He then went on to speak of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>'s hatred of <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slavery, and the probability of her pouncing down upon the slaveholding States, supposing they were to set up for themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>To sustain this position he again brought up the speech of the member from <placeName key="tgn,2110227" n="1.000 5" reg="accomac, accomack, virginia">Accomac</placeName>, which, viewing the subject in a similar fight, said that in the <rs>Union</rs> any such attempt would be repelled by the united strength of the <rs>Republic</rs> &mdash; the sailor from New Bedford would stand by the sailor from <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.-- </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>He asked if <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> would sanction this act of rebellion on the part of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>? </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/> He said it was his object to close his speech this evening, because he did not want it to be said that he consumed any more time than was necessary for an exposition of his views.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>He then proceeded to examine the existing causes of complaint against the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>With regard to the institution of <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slavery, he said it was very easy for those who did not like it to get rid of their slaves, while those who did like it, sometimes found it very difficult to get them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>He liked it, socially, morally, and politically, and he wished he could get a heap more of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>The election of <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00041" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> had been alluded to as a just cause of the dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>He averred that not <num value="1">one</num> of those who supported <persName n="Bell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00042" reg="mostcommon:Bell,nomatch:0"><surname>Bell</surname></persName> and <persName n="Everett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00043" reg="mostcommon:Everett,nomatch:0"><surname>Everett</surname></persName> ever claimed that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00044" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s election would justify such a proceeding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>He went further, and said that of all the <name>Breckenridge</name> speakers whom he heard in the <name>Presidential</name> canvass, none occupied that position, and <persName n="Hunter,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00045" reg="mostcommon:Hunter,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hunter</surname></persName>, in a speech in the city of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, said, in answer to a question, that he did not think the election of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00046" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> would justify dissolution, and if any State went out, he would be among the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to endeavor to bring her back again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>The withdrawal of Southern <rs type="role2">Senators</rs> and Representatives from Congress was strongly condemned by <persName n="Rives,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00047" reg="mostcommon:Rives,Tim,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Rives</surname></persName>, as giving up a power which the <rs>South</rs> possessed for preventing any objectionable appointments, and restraining any act of Administration hostile to her interests. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/> He was for relying upon the law which had confined all preceding <rs type="role2">Presidents</rs> to the sphere of their duty; but if it was not strong enough, make it stronger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>The violations of the fugitive slave law, by Personal Liberty bills, he unequivocally condemned; but he wanted no better security for the enforcement of the fugitive slave law than was found in the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName>, with the army and navy at his back, had full power to execute it, as <persName n="Fillmore,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00048" reg="mostcommon:Fillmore,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Fillmore</surname></persName> did in the case of <persName n="Burns,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00049" reg="mostcommon:Burns,nomatch:0"><surname>Burns</surname></persName> at <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>If it was contended that negroes were not caught at the <rs>North</rs>, it was equally true that they were not caught in the <rs>South</rs>, for the newspapers were constantly advertising runaway negroes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>He thought a good many masters were to blame for dressing their slaves up in fine clothes, and letting them drive about the country, instead of keeping them down in the cornfield, where they belonged.--It looked too much like equality, and invested the mind of the negro with ideas that did not belong there. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/> The Territorial question next occupied his discourse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>He took the ground that we did not want to take our slaves to the <rs type="place">Territories</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>During the <rs>Kansas</rs> excitement there was a great furore in <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, and a bonus of <measure n="50dollars" type="currency">$50</measure> was offered to all who would emigrate, and <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">$100</measure> to every <num value="1">one</num> who carried a slave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>It was only required that they should stay until after the <dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct> election, when, if they thought proper, they could come back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>Only <num value="25">twenty-five</num> enlisted, and of these, not <num value="1">one</num> was a slave-owner!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>A better illustration than this, he said, could be found in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Not a single slaveholder will be fool enough to remove from his plantation there, to the finest fields that bloom in the great plains and valleys of the <rs>West</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/> After some further consideration of this point, he proceeded to urge upon the <rs>Committee</rs> the report on the subject of Federal Relations, which he thought ought to satisfy every <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>Before his constituents he took the ground that <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> should set forth a catalogue of her wrongs, and the mode and measure of redress, and then say to the <rs>North</rs>, <q>&#x0022;You know you have been guilty of these things, and we ask you for this redress;&#x0022;</q> if they refused, then say to them, <q>&#x0022;Let us part in peace &mdash; you take the public property in the <rs>North</rs>, and we take the public property in the <rs>South</rs>; if we get more than you, we will pay you the difference, and if you get the most, pay us the difference.&#x0022;</q> If they refused to accede to these terms, say to them, <q>&#x0022;Come on!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>we are ready for you!&#x0022;</q> He would not wander through a labyrinth of abstractions to get at the right of secession, but raise the flag of revolution, and fight for what could not be obtained in peace-- If, however, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> mode proved effectual, we could say to the seceded States, we have got all we want, the <rs>North</rs> has agreed to put these things in the <rs>Constitution</rs>, and now we ask you to come back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>He believed it was wrong to endeavor to create the impression that such an effort would not succeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>The majority report, as he understood it, covered all the ground of which the <rs>South</rs> complained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>It demanded everything that could be demanded, and yet gentlemen wanted something else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>It reminded him of a cross and ill-natured child, dissatisfied with everything, and crying for something else; and when the nurse took it to the <rs n="looking glass" type="product">looking-glass</rs> to exhibit to the child its own ugliness, it capped the climax by smashing the glass. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Rives,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00050" reg="mostcommon:Rives,Tim,,,:1"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Rives</surname></persName></hi> discussed the several sections of the report, expressing his concurrence therein.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>With regard to the objection against that portion providing for the remuneration of masters for slaves not recovered by the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> authorities, he made an arithmetical calculation, taking the number of slaveholders at <num value="250000">250,000</num>, and the average value of the runaway slaves at <measure n="1000dollars" type="currency">$1,000</measure>; and the <rs>General Government</rs> having paid this to the master, even should the tax fall upon slaveholders alone, it would come to only about <hi rend="italics"><num value="3">three</num> mills</hi> to each man. But falling upon <num value="28000000">28,000,000</num> of people, what a subject for calculation would each <num value="1">one</num>'s portion be. Arguing at some length upon the question of reconstruction, he expressed his belief that the <rs>Southern States</rs> would come back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>He produced statistics to show that <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> had not slaves enough, and urged a change in the agricultural system in order to retain them in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/> Towards the close of his remarks, in order to disabuse the minds of those who thought his enthusiasm for the <rs>Union</rs> was accounted for by the fact that he was a <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> officer, he said he had made a calculation of the emoluments of his office, and found that since the <date value="12-31">31st of December</date> last he had received, as Collector of the <rs type="place">Port of Petersburg</rs>, the enormous sum of <measure n="25.28dollars" type="currency">twenty-five dollars and twenty-eight cents</measure>!. He threw his keys upon the table before him, and said when any <num value="1">one</num> wanted the keys of his office, there they were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>He had no favors to ask. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/> He alluded to the pestilence that once raged in <placeName reg="Portsmouth, Portsmouth, Virginia" key="tgn,7014278">Portsmouth</placeName> and <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>, and to the pecuniary assistance then rendered by the <rs>Northern States</rs> to their suffering brethren of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> &mdash; sending collectively over <measure n="124000dollars" type="currency">$124,000</measure>.--Upon this manifestation of sympathy he dwelt with much earnestness, and with these considerations he closed his remarks, having spoken about <measure n="7hours" type="date">seven hours</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Flourney,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00051" reg="mostcommon:Flourney,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Flourney</surname></persName>,</hi> of <placeName reg="Halifax, Halifax, Virginia" key="tgn,2112076">Halifax</placeName>, took the floor, but gave way for a motion that the <rs>Committee</rs> rise. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/> The Committee then rose and reported progress. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>In Convention. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/> <placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> having resumed the <name>Chair</name>, the <rs>Convention</rs> proceeded to consider the resolution offered by <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Conrad,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00052" reg="mostcommon:Conrad,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Conrad</surname></persName></hi> this morning, to terminate debate in <orgName n="Whole Committee" type="committee">Committee of the Whole</orgName>, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> next. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/> So serious has been the effect of this rush of trade to <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> that Northern merchants engaged in Southern trade have circulated the report that <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> traders have increased their prices by adding on the duties under the recent tariff charged on all goods from the <rs>Northern States</rs>--in other words, that the business men of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> have determined to take an undue advantage of their customers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>This is manifestly so untrue that it is hardly deserving of notice, and yet it is by such means that the attempt is made to obtain Southern patronage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>Of course, when the merchant pays the duty, it will also be charged to the purchaser, and this is a fair business transaction; but even supposing such to be the fact, which we positively deny, would it amount to a reason why Southern merchants should buy at the <rs>North</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>We think not. Clearly, they would be compelled to pay a duty there, and another duty on bringing their goods across the line.
