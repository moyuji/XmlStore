<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> Upon all sides there seems to be a lull of the battle storm which lately swept so fiercely by upon every breeze.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>What does this betoken?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>What fresh preparations upon either side are being made for a more desperate struggle?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>We are in no mood to find fault with our rulers, for we believe them to be wise and fully adequate for all the emergencies of the times &mdash; Their counsel is well kept, and no development has yet been made of their future action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>This is all well; for, without it, their best schemes might be counteracted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>There is, doubtless, a great deal of impatience among our people and even in the army, at the apparent inaction since the <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">battle of Manassas</rs>.--The cry is, <q>&#x0022;On to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.&#x0022;</q> But why?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Let us look calmly at matters and survey the whole field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>Undoubtedly, if the golden opportunity could have been seized upon the afternoon of the rout, and fresh troops had been at hand to the number of <num value="20000">twenty thousand</num>, we should have entered <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> pell mell with the terror-stricken fugitives, despite of the fresh troops which they had in their fortifications.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>But our troops were extended in line of battle for miles upon <placeName reg="Ball Run, Meigs, Ohio" key="tgn,2146062">Ball Run</placeName>, guarding the various fords to prevent the enemy from crossing during the battle, and it was too late to order them to the pursuit when the victory was won. <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Holmes,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00030" reg="nearbymention:Holmes,L.,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Holmes</surname></persName>'</hi> force could not go, for they had made a forced march from Aquia <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">Creek</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>The golden opportunity for taking the <q>&#x0022;sink of iniquity&#x0022;</q> was thus lost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>We do not know whether it is the intention now even to attack that city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>It is strongly fortified upon this side of the <rs>Potomac</rs>, where immense entrenchments have been thrown up, and named <placeName reg="Fort Corcoran">Fort Corcoran</placeName>, after the <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> <rs type="role" reg="Colonel">Colonel</rs> of the <orgName type="regiment" key="69NYVolunteer">69th New York Volunteers</orgName>, now a prisoner in our hands. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> To storm these entrenchments would involve a serious loss of life upon our part; and then, what should we gain after taking them?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>They are too far distant from the city to do us much good in the way of shelling out <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><foreName>Abraham</foreName></persName></hi> and his gang, and the <rs>Potomac</rs> would have to be crossed before anything could be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>It is well enough for us to look these things in the face calmly, and study out the relative cost and gain of any future movement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>The <rs type="place">Long Bridge</rs> would be burnt, and thus the transit of the river cut off except by boats, or a flank movement to cross much higher up. It would be folly to attempt the crossing in boats, when the <orgName n="Navy" type="military">Navy of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName></orgName> has full sway upon those waters.

From some unaccountable cause, large packages have never reached their destination with any degree of regularity when sent by mail, and, consequently, news dealers were compelled to resort to other means to get their supplies transported.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>These irregularities have now become of more frequent occurrence than ever, and it may well be doubted whether the system will ever be improved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>Had there been any law passed by Congress authorizing this restriction, there still would be room for complaint, as the system is altogether unjust, as it levies an exorbitant tax on a particular branch of trade, altogether unheard of; but, when it is stated that, after a searching investigation, your correspondent, with others better informed, has failed to find a single paragraph authorizing, or that would even justify, <persName n="Reagan,Postmaster General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00046" reg="mostcommon:Reagan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Postmaster General">Postmaster-General</roleName> <surname>Reagan</surname></persName>'s const ruction of the law, surely there is sufficient excuse for bringing this matter before the public. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/> &#x0022;The recent decision of the <rs type="role" reg="Postmaster General">Postmaster General</rs> in relation to the transportation of newspapers and periodicals, does not seem to us to have been warranted by a strict construction of the postal laws of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>We are unable to find in the acts of Congress any laws or parts of laws which prohibit the carriage of newspapers outside of the mails without the payment of postage The law of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> session of Congress provided for a certain rate of postage on letters carried my mail, and then, in order to secure a monopoly in the letter- carrying business, a clause was inserted enacting that no letters shall be carried by the express, or other chartered companies, unless the postage on such letters shall have been prepaid; but the prohibition does not apply to newspapers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/> &#x0022;Had the <rs type="role" reg="Postmaster General">Postmaster-General</rs> merely decided that for all papers sent from the office of publication to actual subscribers the regular rates of postage must be paid, the ruling would not have seemed so entirely arbitrary; but is goes further, and applies to all those purchased by newsmen for sale, as well as those sent to subscribers.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/> <num value="1">One</num> of the greatest obstacles in the way of the establishment of direct trade with foreign countries &mdash; immediately upon the opening of the ports of our Confederacy &mdash; is the fact that our merchants are comparatively unknown in foreign markets, and have no credit established there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>Although the products of the <rs>Southern States</rs> have constituted the basis of credits and exchange between the late <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and those nations for more than <num value="0.5">a half</num> century; in a financial and commercial sense, we are unknown to each other &mdash; our bills of exchange having been drawn by Northern houses, and the vast amount of their productions consumed by us &mdash; imported through the same channel &mdash; so little have we been known in these transactions, that years would be required, in the ordinary course of events, to build up that trade and establish that confidence which is absolutely necessary in commercial transactions, which are founded on a system of credits. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/> It is clear, therefore, that some extraordinary measures must be devised, to enable us to free ourselves from these impediments to our commercial credit and independence, and prevent our falling back into the old channel as soon as our ports are again open.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>It is, moreover, desirable that our products, other than our great staple, should be fully made known to the world, and the great advantage to foreign nations of a direct trade with us, and we should all unite our efforts in the promotion of this great work. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/> We therefore cordially invite the merchants, bankers and others of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, to meet us in Mass Convention, in the city of <placeName reg="Macon, Bibb, Georgia" key="tgn,7013980">Macon</placeName>, on the <date value="10-11">11th day of October</date> next, for the purpose of devising some plan for establishing a system of credits between the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States of America</placeName> and foreign countries, which may be practicable and available to all desiring to use it, and which will also command the hearty support of the citizens of our whole country. </p>
