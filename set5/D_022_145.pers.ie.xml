<head>The lines. &#x0026;c.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> From observations made and preparations apparent on every hand, we surmised that operations of an active nature would have transpired yesterday at the lines, but although the enemy appear in threatening attitude at the front, and have unmasked several new batteries, nothing of real consequence occurred to break upon the dullness of the camps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Concentrated as the enemy appears to be on the <placeName reg="Charles City, Floyd, Iowa" key="tgn,2034496">Charles City</placeName> road, constant picket firing is heard at all times in that direction, which, from its increasing spirit and volume of sound, would seem to indicate that an attack is very probable from that direction, and very soon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Lively and brisk skirmishing, in deed, was the <rs n="General Order" type="misc">general order</rs> of things yesterday along our whole front, but terminated in few casualties, and with no particular results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The cannonading heard early yesterday morning, to the right of the lines, proceeded from Federal gunboats below <placeName reg="Drury's Bluff">Drury's Bluff</placeName>, which were shelling woods on the south bank and dispersing our pickets in that direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The Federals seem particularly vindictive towards our outposts in that direction, and lose no opportunity of shelling them; for the pickets of late have been particularly active and watchful, allowing no movement to escape notice, or boats to land, without firing volleys upon the adventurous crews.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>No attack is anticipated, we learn, from the gunboats at the <rs type="place">Bluff</rs>, their presence in the river being to protect transports and landings at different points lower down. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> In fine, although the enemy daily make demonstrations of some kind along our whole front, their movements seem to be undecided, and characteristic of pusillanimity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Whenever they may determine to advance, so sure will their defeat be inevitable.--Our men seem weary of inactivity, and feel confident that, with proper generalship, they can demolish <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s forces in <num value="1">one</num> day's fair and open fight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>This opinion may be secretly entertained by <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> himself, for no other reasons can be assigned for his backwardness and temerity in not accepting the range of battle tendered him daily for the past month. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head><placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s army.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> It is no longer a secret that heavy reinforcements have been sent to <q>&#x0022;<persName n="Stonewall,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Stonewall,nomatch:0"><surname>Stonewall</surname></persName>&#x0022; </q> <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, in the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>, and that he now has an army sufficiently large to cope with any force that can be brought against him by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>What the exact number of these reinforcements are we are unable to say, as they have all been carried over the <orgName n="South Side Railroad" type="railroad">South-Side Railroad</orgName> from <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, and thence to <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName>, via <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Although just on from the <rs>South</rs>, these men are not raw recruits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Many of them have seen service on the <rs>Southern</rs> coast, and were withdrawn only when their posts were occupied by others taken from the different camps of instruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>They are in a measure veterans, and burning with ardor to join their companions in arms, to share with them the glory of the brilliant campaign in the <rs type="place">Valley</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/><persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> now has as many men as he wants &mdash; as many as can be managed successfully in the mountainous district through which he will have to march in order to reach the territory of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>At last accounts all the reinforcements had reached him, and he was steadily pushing forward after <persName n="Shields,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Shields,nomatch:0"><surname>Shields</surname></persName> and <persName n="Fremont,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="nearbymention:Fremont,Banks,,,"><surname>Fremont</surname></persName>, who were retreating before his advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> must either give him battle or be driven across the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>If they have the courage to make a stand, we shall have an opportunity of recording another victory more glorious than any before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>There is no doubt as to the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>No better comment could be made upon the military resources of the <rs>South</rs> than is shown by the fact that, while our armies at all important points have steadily received accessions, a large body of men have been sent to swell the ranks of the <orgName>army of <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName></orgName>. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The enemy fought bravely, but was defeated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>A telegraphic dispatch received yesterday informs us that our victory was complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="420"/>He will not propose the <hi rend="italics">all possidetis,</hi> as we were fearful he would and as doubtless he would were <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 5" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> to take a hand in the work, and <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName> were allowed to have his way.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="422"/>We should be compelled to set them both at defiance, and, if we were able to do nothing else, at least to destroy all the cotton and tobacco rather than let them have it. This course we have already taken with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and the <name>Allies</name> knowing it, would hardly proceed to extremities, thereby defeating the very object of intervention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="423"/><rs type="role" reg="Emperor">The Emperor</rs> has better sense than this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>He will propose to settle the dispute in the same manner in which he has settled all the quarrels in which he has interfered in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>He will propose to leave the matter to universal suffrage, every State voting, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, whether it is in favor of dissolution, and to what portion of the <rs>Union</rs> it will belong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>Here a difficulty occurs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>If all the <name>States</name> vote upon the question of dissolution, we shall be remanded back to the old Union, for the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> outvote us <num value="2">two</num> to <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>This will never do. The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> will not go back into any sort of political association with the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> on any condition whatever.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/> This can hardly be what the <rs>Emperor</rs> means.--Doubtless he takes it for granted that the <rs>Union</rs> is already at an end, and his object is to leave it to each State to say to what political association it will belong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>This is in strict accordance with his theory as he has practiced upon it in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, wherever he has intervened, as in the <name>States</name> of <placeName key="tgn,1000080" n="1.000 187" reg="italia">Italy</placeName> and in <placeName reg="Cluses, Haute-Savoie, Rhone-Alpes" key="tgn,7009045">Savoy</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>His idea is, that the people ought not to be compelled to live in a political association that they do not like.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>This will suit us exactly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>All the <rs>Southern States</rs> will readily agree to such an intervention, for it establishes the <rs>Confederacy</rs> at once.--Every State in that bond will vote for it &mdash; even <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> and <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>; for the late proceedings of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> with regard to confiscation and negro property has turned the hearts of <num value="9">nine</num>- <num value=".1">tenths</num> of those who betrayed the cause for the sake of the <rs>Union</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="436"/>We suspect not. They are fighting now to restore that very state of things which such an intervention would render impossible forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="437"/>They would be compelled, from the pride of consistency, if nothing else, to reject it. Would <rs type="role" reg="Emperor">the Emperor</rs>, in that case, interpose by force of arms?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="438"/>There can be no doubt that he could, if he would, put an end to the war in <measure n="30days" type="date">thirty days</measure>. He could send over iron-clads enough to sink every <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> afloat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>He could land <num value="200000">two hundred thousand</num> men at New York if he thought proper.
