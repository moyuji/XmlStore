<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The fact that invitations are not issued to this brigade makes no difference, and quite as little does the other fact that they never heard of the parties before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>It is enough to announce that there is to be a wedding, and those active burial parties promptly swarm to the front; those near the altar acting as infantry, and those a little further back mounting the benches and backs of the pews, while a few guerrillas capture the chancel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Some have imagined he was armed with the <rs>Jew Benjamin</rs>'s celebrated circular on &#x0022;<rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Finances,&#x0022; which was to have the effect of utterly ruining <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> credit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>They thought that if the wires flashed over <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> from this great moneyed centre the fact that the news of the election of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00065" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> had raised the price of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> stocks, it would seriously injure Confederate credit and create despondency among their <name>English</name> sympathizers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>The rebels and their friends had long prophesied a great fall in gold after <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00066" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,George,Brinton,,:1"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> should be elected, and that, as a result of his election, we should see a peaceful separation of the <rs>South</rs> from the <rs>North</rs>, and a lasting peace and friendship existing between them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>Some of our bankers here had almost made up their minds that it was better for the country to have <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00067" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,Abraham,,,:1"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> defeated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>They therefore hoped for this result, and that, after his defeat, the <rs>Democratic</rs> cry of an armistice and immediate cessation of hostilities would be realized, and that, as a consequence, <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> stocks would advance greatly in price. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/> Gold had been rising for several days before the election, and now <persName n="Mason,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00068" reg="mostcommon:Mason,nomatch:0"><surname>Mason</surname></persName> and <persName n="Erlanger,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00069" reg="mostcommon:Erlanger,nomatch:0"><surname>Erlanger</surname></persName> determined to show the world that by the election of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00070" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, (a Union or war <rs type="role2">President</rs>), gold would go higher and <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> stocks still lower.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>To the evening session of the <name>Bourse</name>, therefore, <persName n="Erlanger,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00071" reg="mostcommon:Erlanger,nomatch:0"><surname>Erlanger</surname></persName> repaired, and at once went to selling stocks (<num value="5.20">5.20</num>'s).

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>This effort knocked the stocks down about half per cent., but next day they again advanced to where they stood before he depressed them, and, in fact, half per cent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>higher. </p> 
<p> All these efforts, it seems, had no great effect in running down stocks, or in injuring, to any extent, the credit of the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>Whatever may be the object of this movement, it was not developed yesterday, the day, on this side of the river, passing off, like many of its predecessors, in unbroken quiet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>During the morning, a very brisk cannonade was heard to the south of the <rs>James</rs>, the occasion of which has not transpired.

<head rend="italics">The country store.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/> In a small country village, &#x0022;the store&#x0022; is the prominent feature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>It is usually on a corner, built of wood, and may be known by <rs n="dry goods" type="product">dry goods</rs> boxes ostentatiously placed on the front, denoting that the proprietor has heavy transactions with importers and jobbers. --Those boxes are capital loafing places on pleasant summer evenings, and many are the profound topics &mdash; polities, religion, etc.--that have been carried on by the occupants of the &#x0022;box seats.&#x0022; Along the side of the store are exhibited some barrels, a few rakes and forks, a bunch of brooms, a pair of scales, and, in mowing time, a scythe or <num value="2">two</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/> A broad door at the side affords ingress to the cellar for barrels of molasses, sugar, pork, etc., an operation which is greatly facilitated by means of a &#x0022;takel,&#x0022; as the boys call it, depending from a beam which protrudes from the roof.--The <rs type="role" reg="junior-Clerk">junior clerk</rs> and the village boys amuse themselves by swinging on the &#x0022;takel&#x0022; when the proprietor has gone to the city to buy &#x0022;goods.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/> It is called the &#x0022;corner store,&#x0022; to distinguish it from the grocery store of inferior pretensions, across the street.--When the proprietor, by strict attention to business, frugality and economy, gets a little &#x0022;forehanded,&#x0022; he moves the wooden store back and builds a magnificent, <num value="2">two</num>-story structure of red brick, has a new sign painted, and from that time on the store is known as &#x0022;the brick store.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>The wooden store affords storage room for merchandise of various kinds, including flour, fish, feathers, paper and rags, which serve the purpose of money at the store.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>The boys are the principal suppliers of old iron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>They confiscate all superannuated stove-plate or retired &#x0022;andirons&#x0022; they may find about the house, and exchange them at the store for powder and shot in squirrel time, or powder without the shot when the <dateStruct value="-07-4"><day reg="4">Fourth</day> of <month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> is near at hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>Wicked little boys sell old iron at the front door, and after it has been conveyed into the store-house they slip around the back door and steal it over again, thereby giving a cheerful impetus to trade and commerce. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/> In every properly conducted store there is a department devoted to the sale of candy, raisins, figs, nuts, etc., which is the great attraction for the little country boy, whose moth; permits him to accompany her to the &#x0022;village&#x0022; for the purpose of &#x0022;doing a little trading.&#x0022;--The cunning &#x0022;storekeeper&#x0022; (that is the title he is known by) knows that a little candy lavished on the boy will prove a good investment, as the heart of a mother is quickest reached through her child, and he accordingly sweetens up little <persName><foreName>Johnny</foreName></persName>, graduating his liberality according to the number of acres of unencumbered farming land which father possesses, and the consequent value of the family custom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>We remember that the sticks of gratuitous candy which the storekeeper thrust into our juvenile pockets were not only &#x0022;seldom,&#x0022; but exceedingly abbreviated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>Our paternal acre and <num value="0.5">a half</num> did not seem to dazzle the storekeeper to any alarming extent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>The village children believe that everything in the way of comforts or luxuries is kept at the store, and they accordingly look upon the storekeeper's children as the most favored mortals on earth.
