<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> When <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>North</foreName></persName>'s Ministry, after having tried for <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> to subdue the colonies of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, and losing a large army in the attempt, learned that <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName> was undoubtedly on the point of forming an alliance, offensive and defensive, with them, they sent Commissioners to make proposals, such as the colonies would have accepted with pleasure in the beginning of the strife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>But it was too late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The <rs n="Declaration of Independence" type="document">Declaration of Independence</rs> had already been adopted &mdash; the alliance with <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName> had already been secured &mdash; the colonies would not think of going back into vassalage, and were determined that the blood they had shed should not be in vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>So they gave a short answer to every proposal of conciliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>They would accept nothing but unconditional independence, and they would make no treaty separate from <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> Of all newspapers on this continent the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName> is the least reliable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>It is not only utterly unscrupulous, but it indulges constantly in a strain of gasconade so supremely ludicrous that we are always at a loss to know whether its <unclear></unclear> are meant for just or earnest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>We place but in the reliance, therefore, on what it says with regard to <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName>'s plan for pacifying &mdash; that is, for subjugating these <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>But suppose he seriously entertains such notions, it is evident that he is but repeating the history of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> Revolution, and that he is induced to attempt conciliation by the same motive that prompted <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>North</foreName></persName>--namely, the fear of foreign intervention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Let us, then, see what he proposes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/> In the first place, the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> are to remain free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The great object for which the <rs>South</rs> so long contended in the <orgName n="United STATES Congress" type="congress">Congress of the United States</orgName> is to be put beyond their reach forever by a single dash of the <rs>Secretary</rs>'s pen. In the second place, <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> is to be a free State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The scoundrels who have robbed her citizens of their slave property are to triumph in their ruin, and they are to receive no indemnification whatever, but to be told that <placeName reg="Missouri" key="tgn,7007523">Missouri</placeName> &#x0022;has chosen to be a free State.&#x0022; a palpable lie, and a lie which nobody better knows to be such than <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>In the third place, after the other slave States have been scoured from <num value="1">one</num> end to the other by <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s hordes of Abolitionists, after half a <num value="1000000">million</num> of slaves have been stolen from them, the masters are to retain all those in their possession at the end of the war. Wonderful liberality, to be sure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Let it be understood, however, that he is thus liberal only because he thinks slavery &#x0022;has received a blow from which it cannot recover&#x0022;--that is to say, because having accomplished all he aimed at nothing more was to be gained by concession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>In a word, <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName>, fancying that because the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army was not destroyed at <placeName reg="Gettysburg, Adams, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014060">Gettysburg</placeName> he is master of the country, proceeds to treat it as though it were already subjugated forgetting how often he has heretofore exposed himself to the ridicule of the world by foretelling the entire suppression of the rebellion in <measure n="90days" type="date">ninety days</measure>. He and <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> are anxious to &#x0022;settle up&#x0022; the present quarrel, and they offer to a people who have half a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men under arms terms of absolute submission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>We do not believe <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> is such a fool as all this amounts to, notwithstanding his predictions with regard to this war. We believe that he has no idea of proposing any such terms, that they are concoctions of the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> correspondent, and that they are written to order, most possibly in the very office of the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>A proper idea he has of &#x0022;the proper measures&#x0022; to settle the controversy, the <rs>South</rs> to give up her arms and submit to the conqueror!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>What worse can she do after she has really been conquered! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> The inducements held out to us to submit to this ignominious treaty are truly very enticing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>It seems that if we continue obstinate <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> commerce will be ruined by the combined navies of <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, and we owe so much to <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Doodle that we will submit to anything rather than witness that catastrophe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, it seems too, want to conquer <placeName reg="Mexico" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName> and <placeName reg="Canada" key="tgn,7005685">Canada</placeName>, and re-establish the <rs>Monroe Doctrine</rs>, as it is foolishly called, which has been unceremoniously trampled in the mire by <persName><roleName n="Emperor">the Emperor</roleName> <foreName>Napoleon</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>And we are supposed to love the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> so dearly that we will jump at the chance to help them out in their ambitious schemes!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>If the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> man is merely making a fool of himself, for the amusement of his readers, we can understand all this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>But if he be in earnest, then we say he cannot make a fool of himself, inasmuch as nature has already done that job for him. We help <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Doodle to fight <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Why, it would be the delight of nearly every soul in the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> to see all Yankeedom turned into a howling wilderness &mdash; to see every mother's son of them massacred, or sold into slavery &mdash; to see <persName n="Boston,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Boston,nomatch:0"><surname>Boston</surname></persName> and New York (like <persName n="Tyre,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Tyre,nomatch:0"><surname>Tyre</surname></persName> of old) turned into little villages, where the fishermen dried their nets. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> Notwithstanding, however, we are not disposed to place any confidence in anything the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> or its correspondents may say, we deem it certain that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName> will never allow the <rs>Union</rs> to be reconstructed.--In that event <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> cannot fail to foresee the downfall of her maritime supremacy, and <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName> the extinction of all hope of ever obtaining a permanent foothold in <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>As long as we fought on equal terms <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> was anxious to see the strife continue; but she is not anxious to see us overwhelmed, as she will be induced by the enormous lies of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> newspapers to believe we are about to be. <persName n="Napoleon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="nearbymention:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><surname>Napoleon</surname></persName> has long been desirous to recognize the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and now that he has planted the tricolor in <placeName reg="Mexico, Mexico, North and Central America" key="tgn,1001893">Mexico</placeName>, he will no longer be withheld by <persName n="England,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:England,nomatch:0"><surname>England</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>These considerations and nothing that the <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> and its correspondents say, induce us to believe that we shall shortly be recognized, at least by <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName>. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head>The disintegration.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> The convulsion which is to cause a permanent disruption of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> and its division into Governments, embracing smaller areas of territory, is a Providential event.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Its purpose is to adapt this immense country to the condition of things which has been so greatly changed since the formation of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>It cannot be defeated or much delayed in its course. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> Such a vast country, inhabited by a civilized and enlightened people, cannot be controlled by <num value="1">one</num> Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>It was easy, and indeed mutually advantageous to the old <num value="13">thirteen</num> States in their infantile and feeble condition to join in a confederacy for limited purposes and common interests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>But in their present populous condition, with conflicting and hostile sectional and social interests and feelings, which have been developed and strengthened as rapidly as the population itself, it would be impossible to hold them together by any means short of a force superior to the spirit and power which resists the union and struggles for separation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>It is not probable &mdash; nay, we say possible &mdash; that so much force can be brought to <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> resist the inevitable disintegration from these causes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Could it be, the <name>States</name> held by force would no longer be free States, and the <rs>Government</rs> that ruled them would of necessity be despotic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>This would not be all. The subjugated States would soon degenerate, and society in them cease to be what it is. Ruined in their wealth and agriculture &mdash; ceasing to be the producers of staple exports, their people would have neither energy nor spirit, and in the scale of civilization would in time come to a level with the <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexicans</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> The convulsion then is begun which either separates the <rs>Union</rs> or permanently changes the <rs>Government</rs> to a rigid despotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>And as such a Government cannot possibly be maintained over so large a territory, inhabited by a civilized and a manly people, the people themselves must be degraded to bear the yoke.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>As such a change in the <rs>Southern</rs> people, at least, is impossible, then it is plain to every <num value="1">one</num> who thinks so &mdash; and who does not?--that the permanent separation of the <name>States</name> into <num value="2">two</num> or more Confederacies or Governments, is a providential decree which cannot be frustrated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> In the history of the world &mdash; in the progress of events directed by Heaven &mdash; men and generations are but atoms &mdash; incidentals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>We are mare agents and <unclear></unclear>. Our grievances and provocations are the mediate causes of the political and social volcano which is now in grand irruption in this land, and which is to change the face of things altogether.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>But the purpose of this change is for the future, and when the problem is solved we will be with the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Our wrongs will have ended and our acts will have finished &mdash; our part in the drama of our day will have been played and the curtain will have fallen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Our example will be left to posterity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>We shall leave them, however, more we shall leave them a free country, a land of independence, a Government of choice, and a rule based on popular consent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> But we repeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The convulsion now in progress is Providential and irresistible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>We have no fear, no apprehension of the result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>We have perfect faith in the ability of the <rs>Southern</rs> people to achieve their independence, but if they wanted the means and the strength, and were about to be overpowered, a new power would appear &mdash; a new agent would intervene for the consummation of the work begun.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The fortunes of war must vary, and all struggles must have their vicissitudes, but a constant and brave people must finally triumph over their oppressors and achieve their right to govern themselves. </p> </div3>
