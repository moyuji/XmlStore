<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> The Grand Jury of the <rs>G. S. Court</rs> at <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName> recently made a presentment on the subject of abuses by Government officers of the transportation facilities placed at their command, from the positions they hold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>In the presentment it was charged that <persName n="Clither,Mister,George,B.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="default:Clither,George,B.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Clither</surname></persName> all, of <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>, had obtained a permit from <persName n="Ashe,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Ashe,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Maj.</roleName> <surname>Ashe</surname></persName>, <rs type="role" reg="Chief">Chief</rs> of Transportation, for the transportation of &#x0022;public supplies,&#x0022; and perverted it to the carriage of private goods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>It seems that no permit was given to <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> C. at all, but that he was acting as a salaried agent for <persName n="Powell,,J.,E.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="default:Powell,J.,E.,,"><foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Powell</surname></persName>, of <persName n="Montgomery,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Montgomery,nomatch:0"><surname>Montgomery</surname></persName>, to whom <rs type="role2">Major</rs> A. had given a letter requesting the <rs>Quartermaster</rs> at New Orleans to permit <persName n="Powell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Powell,J.,E.,,"><surname>Powell</surname></persName> to ship goods when it did not interfere with the <rs>Government</rs> shipments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/> Since the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> caucus at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> the <orgName n="New York World" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">World</hi></orgName> thinks proofs rapidly thicken that the <name>Radicals</name> intend to close the war in the coming spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>There is only <num value="1">one</num> more experiment they wish to try, and that is to arm the negroes in the denrely populated slave districts, and send them marauding through the country, stirring up a wide- spread and bloody servile insurrection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>In commenting on an article from the <orgName n="New York Tribune" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi></orgName>, the <hi rend="italics">World</hi> says: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> They think <num value="60">sixty</num> or <measure n="90days" type="date">ninety days</measure> will suffice for this internal experiment; if it falls, they are then ready to abandon the contest and dissolve the <rs>Union</rs> on the best terms attainable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>This design is clearly shadowed forth in a remarkable article in yesterday's <hi rend="italics">Tribune,</hi> from which we will quote enough to substantiate these charges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The head organ of the <name>Radicals</name> sets out with the postulate that the rebellion can be extinguished in <measure n="90days" type="date">ninety days</measure>, if ever. &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">We believe that it may be virtually crushed out within the next <measure n="90days" type="date">ninety days</measure> and that it is far more likely to be within that term than ever afterward. &#x0022;</hi> </p> </q><bibl n="The World"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> The fact that the <name>Radicals</name> are ready to give up if <measure n="90days" type="date">ninety days</measure> or less do not finish the business crops out all through the article, as will be seen in the further quotations we will introduce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The financial basis recommended to sustain these brief operations is stated as follows: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> &#x0022;Borrow temporarily, on the best possible terms, <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="400000000">four hundred millions</num>, to be paid in at the rate of <num value="5000000">five millions</num> per day, with a clear understanding that we are to borrow no more &mdash; that the war is to be finished with this amount, and that speedily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>It is the never-ending prospect of loans after loans that discourages lenders&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> <num value="300000000">Three hundred millions</num> paid in (and we suppose also paid out) at the rate of <num value="5000000">five millions</num> a day would last <measure n="60days" type="date">sixty days</measure>; <num value="400000000">four hundred millions</num>, <measure n="80days" type="date">eighty days</measure>. The capitalists who furnish this loan are to receive a distinct assurance &#x0022;that we are to borrow no more &mdash; that the war is to be finished with this amount,&#x0022; or, in other words, the <rs>Government</rs> is to promise to recognize the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> unless it brings them to terms within the brief period required for the expenditure of that sum. In order to spend the money as fast as possible and to make the final blow as vigorous as possible, it is proposed &#x0022;to call out the uniformed militia of the loyal States for <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>, and employ them to garrison <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName>, <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName>, <placeName reg="Louisville, Jefferson, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013915">Louisville</placeName>, &#x0026;c., and to hold the line of the <rs>Potomac</rs> and the <orgName n="Baltimore and Ohio Railroad" type="railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</orgName>, while every soldier now in the service is sent to the front and employed in the active work of the campaign.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> All these arrangements are merely ancillary to the main purpose of arming ad the negroes the <rs>Government</rs> can get hold of, and sending them roving in small bodies through the thickly-settled slave regions, instigating the blacks to rise against their masters, and convert the <rs>South</rs> into a bloody and flaming Pandemonium.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>This purpose is avowed in the following terms: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> &#x0022;Having thus massed our forces and filled our deports and caissons, charge upon the rebels in every quarter &mdash; assailing their ports with iron-clads, their armies with stronger armies, fighting resolutely but warily with intent to capture their strongholds and exhaust their resources &mdash; while expeditions of light-armed black <rs n="Unionist" type="political">Unionists</rs>, carrying only arms and ammunition, traverse those portions of rebeldom most exposed and thickly peopled with slaves, carrying liberty to all who wish it, and arms wherewith to defend it, moving rapidly and evading all fortified points and overpowering forces, while breaking up railroads and telegraph lines, and making trouble generally.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> The Union armies are to be used to concentrate the rebels in defence of their strongholds and important strategic positions, in order that squads of &#x0022;light-armed black <persName n="Unionists,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Unionists,nomatch:0"><surname>Unionists</surname></persName>&#x0022; may have a free field in roaming over the plantations, and inciting the slaves to insurrection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>We charged when the radicals began to clamor for the proclamation, and to hound on the <rs>President</rs> to issue it, that this was the object at which they were aiming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>But little more than <measure n="20days" type="date">twenty days</measure> have passed since the proclamation, and the truth of the charge is openly confessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The intention to bring the war to an immediate close, if the projected servile insurrection does not shatter the strength of the rebellion, is acknowledged with almost equal frankness. &#x0022;If <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure> more of earnest fighting,&#x0022; says the <hi rend="italics">Tribune,</hi> &#x0022;shall not serve to make a serious impression on the rebels &mdash; if the end of that term shall find us no further advanced than its beginning &mdash; if some malignant fate has decreed that the blood and treasure of the nation shall ever be squandered in fruitless efforts--<hi rend="italics">let us bow to our destiny, and make the best attainable peace.&#x0022;</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> In pursuance of this design to bring the war to a close within the ensuing <measure n="90days" type="date">ninety days</measure>, every encouragement is to be given to foreign powers to come forward with proffers of mediation, which, if made, are to be treated &#x0022;with politeness and most distinguished consideration. &#x0022; The Radicals wish to have a pacificator at the door if their grand experiment of a gigantic slave insurrection turns out an abortion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Here is what the <hi rend="italics">Tribune </hi> says on this point: </p> <cit><q rend="break">

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>We cannot be required to arrest the war until we shall have substantially agreed on the conditions of peace; we cannot be expected to consider any proposals of mediation until they shall have <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> been accepted by the rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/><hi rend="italics">It will thus be <dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct> or thereabout before we can be fairly asked to say yes or no to any such interposition,</hi>&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="Tribune"></bibl></cit>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>The context, which says that a faithful and dutiful <name>Christian</name> slave becomes the freedman of his Heavenly Master, clearly proves that a slave who refuses the offer of freedom has a high scriptural argument for his choice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/> The fact that the <rs type="place">Harriet Lane</rs> was carried by boarding is significant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>The account of the battle states, that after pouring a destructive volley among her crow from double barrel shot guns (an other proof of the value off that inestimable weapon) the <rs>Confederate</rs> boarded her, and completed their victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>To get upon an enemy's decks, and whip him on his own dunghill in a hand-to-hand fight, is universally regarded as the best proof of superior pluck which seamen can give.
