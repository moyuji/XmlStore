<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>A month ago it was not believed that he would form a junction with the army at <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> before the <date value="02-01">first of February</date>; whereas the <orgName n="Louisville Journal" type="newspaper">Louisville <hi rend="italics">Journal</hi></orgName>, of the <dateStruct value="--17"><day reg="17">17th inst.</day></dateStruct>, informs us that he has already joined his forces with those of <persName n="Thomas,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Thomas,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Thomas</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>Had he continued to move along the <orgName n="Memphis and Charleston Railroad" type="railroad">Memphis and Charleston railroad</orgName>, and to repair the track as he came, it is not probable that he would have arrived here before early spring.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>It is not believed that his forces have yet come to <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, but have stopped at <placeName key="tgn,2005379" n="1.000 91" reg="stevenson, jackson, alabama">Stevenson</placeName> and <placeName reg="Bridgeport, Cocke, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098103">Bridgeport</placeName>, from which points they conveniently threaten our left flank.--If they have crossed the <rs>Tennessee</rs> at all, they are still in the neighborhood of <placeName reg="Bridgeport, Cocke, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098103">Bridgeport</placeName>, or somewhere on the railroad between that point and <placeName reg="Brown's Ferry">Brown's Ferry</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> The enemy's movements yesterday were just sufficient to justify the suspicion that he intended to throw a force into <placeName reg="McLemore's Cove">McLemore's Cove</placeName> to-day.--If such was his design he has abandoned it, for the present at least; but whether on account of the heavy rains last night and to day, or because he found that the vigilant eyes of the <rs>Confederates</rs> were upon him, it is impossible to say. That he has withdrawn his whole army out of <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> except a few divisions, there can be but little doubt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The chief doubt felt is in regard to his designs, whether he intends to make an assault upon <placeName reg="Lookout Mountain, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100143">Lookout mountain</placeName>, or to repeat the man&#x0153;uvre of <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName>, and move down <placeName reg="Wills's Valley">Wills's Valley</placeName> in the direction of <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome, Ga.</placeName> It is not supposed that the forces withdrawn have yet left the vicinity of <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>; they are probably concealed in the timber on the north side of the river, or in <placeName reg="Lookout Valley, Buffalo, Wisconsin" key="tgn,2469816">Lookout Valley</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Possibly a portion of them have marched up the river to the assistance of <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName>, now beleaguered in <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> The storm has certainly gathered, and the thunderbolt is forged and ready to be launched; but we hope that the movement in <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName> will serve as a conductor, and that if the lightning be not stayed altogether it may at least be diverted from our devoted heads. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> Up to <time value="5oclock">five o'clock</time> this afternoon no intelligence had been received at headquarters of any engagement in the neighborhood of <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName> other than that between <persName n="Wheeler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Wheeler,nomatch:0"><surname>Wheeler</surname></persName> and the <rs>Federal</rs> cavalry, in which we captured about <measure n="300" type="prisoners">300 prisoners</measure>, killed and wounded about <num value="100">100</num>, and drove the enemy from <placeName reg="Maryville, Blount, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100274">Maryville</placeName> back into <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/> This event, which has long been foreseen, has taken, as far as we can learn, nobody by surprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>From the very moment when <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00177" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName>, in the full career of an unparalleled victory, ordered his men to halt in the pursuit, and employ the time that might have sufficed to anuihilate the enemy in picking up the arms that he had thrown away, the very air has been pregnant with augury of the most gloomy descrption.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>Nor were these dark anticipations in any degree disal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>pated by the quarrels among the officers, their distrust of <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00178" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName>, his numerous arrests, and the general dissatisfaction of soldiers and men, followed as it was, and necessarily must have been, by a general relaxation of discipline, and the absence of that vigilance which prevents surprise and is cadential to the very existence of an army.--The public hoped nothing from that quarter and they have not been disappointed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/> We profess not to know anything about military affairs &mdash; certain editors tell us that the art of war is not amenable to the criticism of anybody who has not graduated at <placeName reg="West Point, King William, Virginia" key="tgn,2114999">West Point</placeName>, and that disaster after disaster, bringing in its train unprecedented loss of life, and surrender of territory, affords in proof whatever that a General is not equal to his place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>We are told, moreover, that it is presumptuous in any <num value="1">one</num> who is not a West Pointer to express even an opinion up on military man&#x0153;uvres, although their failure or success involve his life, his property, and his freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>Be it so. We only express the opinion of the unmilitary multitude, when we say that to their unmilitary eyes the campaign before <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> has been a very strange <num value="1">one</num>, and that having looked out daily for a disaster they are enabled to bear it with perfect equanimity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>What farther evil is in store for the country at that point they cannot foresee, but they look forward with faint hope of anything short of evil.--They see that no remonstrance, nor petition, nor prayer, can produce a change, and they fold their hands almost in despair. </p>
