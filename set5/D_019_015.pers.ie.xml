<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> The <rs>Brooklyn</rs> rounded too and was surprised to see that the schooner did not proceed to sea.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The steamer finally went back, and the schooner made her way leisurely into the harbor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>It now occurred to those on board the <rs type="ship">Brooklyn</rs> that the sailors on the schooner wore black <rs n="silk hats" type="product">silk hats</rs>, standing collars, store clothes, &#x0026;c., and the impression soon prevailed that the schooner was <num value="1">one</num> of the guard vessels that had been sent out to intercept the <rs>Brooklyn</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>As for the officers, nothing could be gained from them &mdash; they were perfectly mum on all the various subjects connected with the ship or her cruise, and if they discussed the subject at all, they did so privately.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>That it did not occur in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> is proved by the letters already referred to. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="431"/>You will bear in mind that I am defending <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and not prosecuting New York, or I would have but little difficulty in rendering certain hat which the good manners of His Grace did not wish openly to declare, by showing conclusively that he referred to a man in the crowd at New York, who did make use of disrespectful language towards His Royal Highness the <rs>Prince</rs> of <placeName reg="Wales, United Kingdom, Europe" key="tgn,7002443">Wales</placeName>, within hearing of the <rs type="place">Royal</rs> party in the <rs type="place">Royal</rs> carriage, and this, too, doubtless in the presence of His Honor the <rs>Mayor</rs>, surrounded by his regiment of police in arms,--But what signifies all this; for what city, as large as the <placeName type="city" key="tgn,7007567">city of New York</placeName>, in which a drunken blackguard may not be found who cares not for <placeName key="possibilities=15" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Kings</placeName>, Lords or Commons?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>But I do object to the transfer of this indignity to these distinguished strangers, who were our national guests, from its proper locality to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>We have happily learnt <persName><roleName n="Queen">Queen</roleName> <foreName>Victoria</foreName></persName>'s character, through purer channels than international exchanges of editorial calumny, and certainly, if private, social and domestic virtues constitute the excellence of woman, then the <rs>Queen</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> may well be pointed at as their most illustrious <sic>examplar</sic>; and I am sure that I may speak for <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, and say it is for these that the descendants of the <name>Cavaliers</name> of Old England admire her, and <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> eyes regard her as more brilliant than all the jewels of her crown. </p>
