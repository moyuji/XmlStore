<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>These negroes, it was subsequently ascertained, had run away from that place some <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> previous, and had now come back after their wives and children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>Making fast to the vessel, they endeavored to seize the dog and stop his mouth by sending him to the bottom; but the animal would not allow a stranger's hand to be placed upon him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/> Upon reaching the shore the captain declared that, had be seen his captors approach from the <rs>Southern</rs> bank, the ruse adopted would not have availed, for he had arms aboard, (<placeName reg="Enfield, Hampshire, Massachusetts" key="tgn,2317638">Enfield</placeName> rifles,) and would have only surrendered with his life. </p>
