<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>If it costs blood, so much the better, the price will be dearer and the object secured will be the more highly prized. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> &#x0022;What is the <rs>Governor</rs> about?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>why delay when our honor is at stake?&#x0022; cry out the masses. &#x0022;We fly to arms when called; we endure the vigors of an unusually hard winter; we guard sand hills and cold iron guns; we expose ourselves needlessly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Give us battle, but don't suffer us to waste time in this manner. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> But in the matter of <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> I no longer have doubt, though it may not be wise or prudent for me to give my reasons, notwithstanding I consider that I have full authority to do so. Yesterday quite an unusual scene occurred in the <rs type="place">Senate Chamber</rs>, which, with others in the lobby.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>I had the felicity of witnessing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The subject matter under consideration was an appropriation of <measure n="950000dollars" type="currency">$950,000</measure> for military contingencies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/><num value="1">One</num> of the <rs>Senators</rs> whose name figures pretty extensively in the prints of the city each morning, having probably suffered himself to be led away by the ardor of some young soldier, rose in his seat and violently opposed the appropriation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>He saw no hope of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> ever assuming her independence in fact, as she had in name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>There was a large party he thought in the <rs>State</rs> disposed to allow the usurp of State to be dismantled and submerged, and he was not disposed to tax the people for raising so immense a sum when the <rs>State</rs> was not prepared to carry out her Ordinance of Secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The people were led off with a wrong idea, and unless we had some assurance that this money was to be properly applied &mdash; applied to the taking of <placeName key="tgn,2096786" n="1.000 14" reg="sumter, sumter, south carolina">Sumter</placeName> &mdash; it was no use to raise it.

<head>Pecuniary results of a Southern Confederations.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="376"/> Every great measure has its profit and loss account &mdash; its advantages as well as its disadvantages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="377"/>The <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> colonies, in throwing off the yoke, lost many brave men, many hard-earned dollars, much valuable property, and <num value="8">eight</num> long years of what might have proved most prosperous times; but they gained the priceless jewel of liberty &mdash; they planted themselves on the staunch platform of independence, whereon has been erected our splendid fabric of greatness and power. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="378"/> If the <rs>Union</rs> must be dissolved &mdash; If this glorious fabric must be levelled to the dust, contrary to the wishes of the <rs>South</rs>, and in spite of her last <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> effort to save it, then it becomes her sons to banish as far as possible all useless regrets, and to turn their eyes away from the gloomy aspects of the subject to the contemplation of the bright features which even this picture presents. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="379"/> Magnificent as was this glittering structure of Union, its cost to the <rs>South</rs> was on a scale commensurate with its splendor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="380"/>We shall not stop at this time to prove that its cost to the <rs>South</rs>, through the <name>Tariff</name>, during the last <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure>, has been equivalent to <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of all the revenues collected, amounting to an average of nearly <num value="60000000">sixty millions</num> per annum; for the tariff is levied exclusively upon the foreign commerce of the country, and the <rs>South</rs> furnishes <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of the exports which support this foreign commerce;--although numbering but <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of the population of the <rs>Union</rs>, she pays <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of the federal revenue, or <num value="38000000">thirty-eight</num> to <num value="40000000">forty millions</num> of dollars, whereas she is justly chargeable with only <num value="20000000">twenty millions</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="381"/> Now, the difference between <num value="20">twenty</num> and <num value="38000000">thirty-eight</num> to <num value="40000000">forty millions</num> of dollars a year is a very large sum of money, and, when counted for periods of <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> or more, amounts to an enormous capital for the &#x0022;poor&#x0022; South to lose and the &#x0022;rich&#x0022; North to gain by the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="382"/>To make the matter worse, not even <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> of the public revenue is expended within her limits; but the great bulk of it, though contributed by herself, is disbursed at the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="383"/>Behold in this single fact, which has been in operation on a gradually increasing scale for <num value="3">three</num>-quarters of a century, the real secret of the great preponderance of the <rs>North</rs> in manufactures, shipping and commercial power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/>Some of the public men of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> talk lugubriously of the frightful taxation which will be entailed upon the <rs>State</rs> by dissolution, in war debts and extraordinary war expenditures; but no figures which they can possibly marshal on this account can approximate the enormous drain of Southern capital and wealth which must continue to go on under the <rs>Union</rs> and its tariff. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/> The South exported last year <measure n="250000000dollars" type="currency">$250,000,000</measure> of products to foreign countries, and is supposed to have sent at least <measure n="100000000dollars" type="currency">$100,000,000</measure> more to the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>These exports, or else her returns of <measure n="350000000dollars" type="currency">$350,000,000</measure> of imports taken in exchange for them, present a basis of revenue well calculated to dispel any fears of public bankruptcy which even her most despondent citizens might entertain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>A duty as low as <num value="0.1">10 per cent</num>, upon this trade would give a revenue of <measure n="35000000dollars" type="currency">$35,000,000</measure> for the support of her political system under a <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/> Now, the <rs>Southern</rs> people have felt too bitterly the burden of a &#x0022;splendid government,&#x0022; under the <rs>Union</rs>, to be willing to repeat the expensive folly in a Confederacy of their own. They would eschew the scheme of a complete Federal Government, surrounded with all the costly trappings of imperial power, and content themselves with a mere Federal Agency, such as <hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName key="tgn,2570615" n="1.000 1" reg="patrick henry, charlotte, virginia">Patrick Henry</placeName></hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Mason,,George,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00251" reg="default:Mason,George,,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Mason</surname></persName></hi> esteemed sufficient to answer all federal purposes, and such as the <rs>Government</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> was originally designed to be. Such an agency would be as cheap in its administration as simple in its structure; scarcely costing on a peace footing more than <num value="5000000">five millions</num> a year, and not exceeding more than an average of <num value="15000000">fifteen millions</num> per annum in long periods embracing all the contingencies in peace and war. But even the latter expenditures would leave <measure n="20000000dollars" type="currency">$20,000,000</measure> to spare from the <num value="35000000">thirty-five millions</num> which a <num value="0.1">ten per cent</num>, tariff would produce on the trade of the <rs>South</rs>--a sum which would more than defray all the expenses of her State government, the grand total of which for <dateStruct value="1859--"><year reg="1859">1859</year></dateStruct> was less than <measure n="15000000dollars" type="currency">$15,000,000</measure>. Thus dissolution, so far from being a ruinous loss to the <rs>South</rs>, would prove a splendid speculation, by stopping the exhausting drain of the present continental tariff, and relieving the whole Southern people of the burden of direct taxation for State expenditures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>The <num value="15000000">fifteen millions</num> of general outlay would furnish means for the support of a cordon of customs offices along the border of the <rs>North</rs>, which would serve the double purpose of collecting the tariff due on Northern fabrics, and of apprehending fugitive negroes in their passage along the <orgName n="Underground Railroad" type="railroad">underground railroad</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/> But in order to realize these results, <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> would have to attach herself to the fortunes of the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> States, who furnish nearly the whole of this immense exportation of <measure n="350000000dollars" type="currency">$350,000,000</measure>. It is only by this means that she could reap the double advantage of participating in the revenue based upon these exports, and obtaining release from the burdensome taxation entailed by the <rs>Northern</rs> tariff and the costly Government at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>Nor would she have any reason to fear that her Southern confederates would be unwilling to foster her infant manufactures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>These States have been willing to foster even Northern manufactures, at the enormous cost already shown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>Much more readily will they consent to grant all needful encouragement to the manufactures of a Southern sister State, bone of their bone and flesh of their flesh, if she but promptly bring to their cause all the moral, political, and historical weight, attaching to the name of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>Another example has just occurred of the vigor and spirit with which Northern men defend their property when it is assailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>It would be unfair to condemn him upon the evidence of those who have visited the scenes in which many of his events are laid within the present century, and have thus enjoyed an opportunity of verifying his statements by the evidence of their own eye-sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>It must be recollected that he lived in an age in which intercourse between the existing nations was limited and difficult &mdash; when perils of every description beset the path, and impeded the advance of the traveller &mdash; when traveling was not performed by solitary individuals, but in caravans, and at stated periods &mdash; when the travellers were almost wholly merchants, whom a spirit of enterprise and the hope of large profits allured to the most remote regions &mdash; when nothing but a superstitious dread of their local divinities under whose protection the fancied merchants were taken prevented the inhabitants of the marts in which their journeys terminated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/> <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, and, I doubt not, <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, have seceded from the <rs>Union</rs> as it was, because of the ills inflicted, and the greater ills threatened, by the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republicans</rs> of the <rs>North</rs>; and the great question to be submitted to the <rs>Convention</rs> will be, &#x0022;Shall <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> adhere to the slaveholding States of the <rs>South</rs>, or remain in a Union, which, although broken for all good ends, yet binds her to the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republicans</rs> of the <rs>North</rs>?&#x0022; Upon this question, my opinions were so fully and freely expressed in the late Presidential canvass, that it can hardly be necessary to repeat them now.--But still it may be proper to do so, as I am now before you as a candidate, and there may be some to whom my opinions may not be known.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>My opinion, then, is, that <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> should adhere to the slave States of the <rs>South</rs>, and that her decision should be immediate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>As I have said, <num value="6">six</num> States have already seceded from all connexion with the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republicans</rs>; and I have no doubt that <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">N. Carolina</placeName>, <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>, <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>, <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> and <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> will do likewise; in short, that all the other slave States, except <rs n="Delaware" type="nativeamerican">Delaware</rs>, will do so. Certainly <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> and <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName> will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>If all, or only the <num value="3">three</num> last do, what will be the condition of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>?--She must remain, in <num value="1">one</num> case, the only slave State, and the largest; in the other, <num value="1">one</num> of <num value="4">four</num> slave States, at the feet of the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republicans</rs>, or she must unite herself with the <num value="9">nine</num> slave States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>I can hardly think that any <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginian</rs> would be mad enough to keep her, if he could, in such a hopeless alliance with the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republicans</rs>; for, if she could not protect herself from them (as experience has shown she could not) when all the <rs>Southern States</rs> were co-operating with her, she certainly can not do so after she shall have lost the aid of <num value="9">nine</num> of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/>Of necessity, therefore, as well as from affection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>I hope &mdash; from pride and honor, she must go with the great body of the slave States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/>The only question, then, is, when shall she go?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>I say before the <date value="03-04">4th of March,</date> for the following reasons, viz: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/> I. Because, if <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> remains under the present Government until after <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00412" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00413" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> come into power, she will be involved in civil war, whether she submits to them or not. If she then refuses to submit, the war will be against her, as well as the other seceding States; and if she submits, it will be against the seceding States, and she will be compelled to take part in it, with the <rs>North</rs>, or with the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>I can not conceive that she can ever be so mad and infamous as to fight with the <rs>North</rs> against the <rs>South</rs>, or refuse to fight with the <rs>South</rs> against the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/>The <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginian</rs> who would do so is indeed a &#x0022;traitor knave,&#x0022; fit only to &#x0022;fill a coward's grave;&#x0022; and so <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> has in fact declared, through her representatives in the present <orgName n="General Assembly" type="misc">General Assembly</orgName>, now sitting in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, by their anti-coercion resolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>It is the dictate, then, of prudence, policy, and wisdom, to take without delay the position with the <rs>South</rs> which she intends to take ultimately; and thus, in my opinion, she will prevent civil war, for all the border slave States will go with her, and the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republicans</rs> will never attack a united South. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/> <num value="2">II</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="636"/>Because I believe all the negotiations will do no good, until the <rs>Southern States</rs> have taken their position outside of the <rs>Union</rs>, and organized their government, when, under the law of nations, the flag of the <orgName n="Southern Union" type="union">Southern Union</orgName> will protect the people of that Union from the <name>Smalleys</name> of the <rs>North</rs> and the wretched hemp-rite traitors of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/>If, then, the just men of the <rs>North</rs> shall have the power, as some strangely think they have, and the will, to re-unite with the <rs>South</rs>, upon proper terms, they will so propose, and the <rs>South</rs> will be free to accept, if it chooses to do so. All negotiations in the meanwhile will only have the effect to injure the <rs>South</rs> by delay; and they are designed by the submissionists of the <rs>South</rs>, and will be intended, if entered into, by the <rs>North</rs>, to waste the time until <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00414" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> and <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00415" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> and their party get into power; and then they will cry &#x0022;Treason!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/>and let slip the dogs of war&#x0022; upon you.--The men who advise you to wait until that period arrives, will then advise you to submit to the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republican</rs> rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>He who will not &#x0022;face the music&#x0022; now, will certainly not do it then.--Let the motive for delay be what it may, however, the effect will be the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>As to the idea of a Central Republic, it is even more odious than the idea of remaining as we now are. It is absurd.--It involves, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, disunion from the great <rs>North</rs>, and then re-union with the little <rs>North</rs>, and still the degrading subjection of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> to the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republicans</rs>, with the <rs>South</rs> arrayed, and properly arrayed, against her. What will be her condition with the <rs n="Black Republican" type="political">Black Republicans</rs> pressing on her northern, and a hostile South on her southern border?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/>Let the slaveholders of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> look well to the answer to this question before they allow <num value="2">two</num>-penny politicians &mdash; who are thinking of themselves and not the country, or those who are unable to look the trouble in the face &mdash; to mislead them by this dodge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>My counsel to you, fellow-citizens, is to look the danger full in the face; waste no time in delusive negotiations, with the guns of the enemy bearing upon you, all your forts in his possession, and the halter around your necks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>Take, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, an independent attitude, place yourselves upon an equal footing with him, and then negotiate, if you please.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>Then, and not till then, can you negotiate with honor, or any hope of success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>Then, honorable re-construction may come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>In conclusion, allow me to say that individual hopes and wishes are of small concern at such a moment as the present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>Principle is the great thing to be looked to in choosing a representative, and those who concur with me in opinion will not, I hope, permit my name to be a stumbling block in their path, but wholly disregard it, if it be necessary to do so, in the vindication of our principles and our country. </p> <closer> <salute>With great respect, <lb/> Your humble serv't,</salute> <lb/> <signed><persName n="Lyons,,James,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00416" reg="default:Lyons,James,,,"><foreName>James</foreName>  <surname>Lyons</surname></persName>.</signed> <lb/> Laburnum, <date value="1861-01-26">Jan. 26th, 1861.</date> <lb/> ja <num value="29">29</num>--1t </closer> </div4> </div3>
