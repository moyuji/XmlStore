<head>The Situation.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>The Grecian superstition with regard to the <hi rend="smallcaps">Theme,</hi> or supernatural voice, is familiar to every man at all acquainted with Grecian literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>It was nothing more than that unaccountable inspiration (if it be allowable to use the word in that sense) by which a highly wrought community is enabled to anticipate the common vehicles of intelligence when great events are on the wing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Theme</hi> played an important part in the history of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName> on an occasion mentioned by <persName n="Herodotus,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Herodotus,nomatch:0"><surname>Herodotus</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The battles of Plat&#x0153;a and <placeName reg="Mycale">Mycale</placeName> were fought on the same day &mdash; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in the morning, the last in the evening &mdash; the former in Bolotia, the latter in lonia &mdash; the distance between them being at least <measure n="1000miles" type="distance">one thousand miles</measure>. As the <name>Greeks</name> at <placeName reg="Mycale">Mycale</placeName> were about to join battle a herald's staff was found on the beach, and the <hi rend="smallcaps">Phene</hi> proclaimed among the host, who were previously somewhat dispirited at sight of the enemy's numbers, that the great <rs n="Persian" type="ethnic">Persian</rs> army had been destroyed at Plat&#x0153;s that morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The intelligence ran like wild-fire through the <rs>Grecian</rs> host, who, roused to a pitch of irresistible enthusiasm, crashed upon the enemy, put him to the rout, and inflicted upon him a slaughter only inferior to that his countrymen had endured in the morning at Plat&#x0153;a. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> We had a striking example of the operations of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Phene</hi> in this city on the occasion of the capture of <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Last <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, <date value="06-14">14th June,</date> (the <num value="63" type="ordinal">sixty-third</num> anniversary of the battle of <placeName key="tgn,2035190;tgn,2028962" n="0.076 000000.6820	placename;tgn,2035190;marengo, iowa, iowa,Iowa,Iowa,United States,North and Central America;0.061 000000.5456	placename;tgn,2028962;marengo, mchenry, illinois,McHenry,Illinois,United States,North and Central America" reg="marengo, iowa, iowa,Iowa,Iowa,United States,North and Central America;marengo, mchenry, illinois,McHenry,Illinois,United States,North and Central America">Marengo</placeName>,) <persName n="Early,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Early,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Early</surname></persName> stormed the works around that town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>There is no telegraphic communication thence with <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Yet almost before the smoke of the battle field had cleared away rumors of the result began to spread.--On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> they pervaded the whole city, and described the actual condition of affairs with a minuteness and accuracy absolutely astounding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The number of guns and prisoners were designated, and it was stated that <persName n="Milroy,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Milroy,nomatch:0"><surname>Milroy</surname></persName> had escaped, which turns out to be true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>We leave it to <unclear>metaphyst </unclear> to account for this singular phenomenon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>We content ourselves with saying that it was very singular, and, to us, altogether unaccountable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The capture of <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName> is <num value="1">one</num> of the most glorious, and we believe it is destined to prove <num value="1">one</num> of the most important, events of the war. It seems to be the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in a projected series of operations, which there is every reason to believe will result most beneficially to the cause of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>What those projected operations may be, we cannot even conjecture, and we only presume that they are to be, because <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="nearbymention:Lee,W.,H.,F.,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> is not the man to indulge in isolated enterprises, having no bearing upon the grand object of the campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>The actual tangible fruits are very great.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/><num value="50">Fifty</num> cannon, <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> (so reported) of wagons, large numbers of cattle, cows, and mules, and <measure n="9000" type="prisoners">9,000 prisoners</measure>, including <measure n="2000" type="captured">2,000 captured</measure> by <persName n="Johnson,General,Edward,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="default:Johnson,Edward,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Edward</foreName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The enemy behaved exactly as might have been expected of such wretches.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>They proved in plain terms to be arrant cowards.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Placed behind strong fortifications, they only stood their ground long enough to kill and wound <num value="100">100</num> of our men.--Oppressors are almost always cowards, and these were oppressors of the most brutal description. </p> </div3> 
<div3 type="article" n="2"> 
<head>The Carnival of Jackasses.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> Just before these solemn services of Lent which commemorate the most sacred and sorrowful events in the history of man, <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>, &#x0022;the eternal city,&#x0022; becomes the theatre of a Carnival in which the <name>Abbot</name> of Unreason displaces all other dignitaries, and the nonsensical and indecorous run riot in every street and habitation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Not before, but during this grand tragic era, in which the blood of martyrs bedews every hillside and every plain, and tears of bereavement and anguish fall like rain upon desolated hearthstones, we, too, have a Carnival, running like the <rs type="place">Gulf</rs> stream, isolated and distinct, through the great ocean of public tribulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>For want of a better name, we must call it the <name>Carnival</name> of Jackasses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>It is some consolation to reflect that, whilst multitudes of men are dying and suffering, there are animals who can wallow up to their long ears in green pastures and by still waters, and who can wax fat and kick in pampered insolence amid the toils, privations, and self-denials of suffering humanity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Never did a war present such startling contrasts as this between the glory and shame of a people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>On <num value="1">one</num> hand, there has been among the citizens proper of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> such self-sacrificing patriotism as the world has never before witnessed; on the other hand, such marble-hearted and villainous extortion and speculation as would put to the blush professional thieves and banditti.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>On the <num value="1">one</num> hand, in the army, we behold deeds of heroism that throw into the shade the most radiant achievements of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName> and <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> valor; on the other, wearing the insignia of the same army, are to be found the most pompous and imbecile pretenders, who use the war simply for their self-glorification and aggrandizement, and who have never smelt a grain of gunpowder since the war began. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> It is enough to make the coldest blood boil to witness the indignities which the private soldiers of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, men of whom the world is not worthy, often receive from the miserable upstarts whose official position gives them an opportunity to play off the fantastic pranks of their brief authority over their superiors in every quality of honest manhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>We are pleased to believe that it is not, in general, birds of our own nest who flutter about in false plumage, and who use their beaks and talons, not to harass the public enemy, but to rend and devour those heroes who escape the perils of the battle-field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The ravenous crew are mostly adventurers who have no earthly sympathy with the <rs>Southern</rs> cause except the prevent and pay which it puts into their pockets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>They are attached to us as the leech is attached to intimated temples, for the blood wherewith to gorge themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>These are the fine fellows who, safely ensconced in the <rs>Confederate</rs> capital, presume to browheat and insult wounded, native-born soldiers of the <rs>South</rs>, whose shoe latchets they are not worthy to unloose, and who, buttoned up in gay military coats that were never soiled by the rude contact of carnage and death, look down in lordly magnificence upon the way worn, ragged sons of battle, who have become way worn and ragged in defending the gay varlets who treat them with harshness and contempt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> cannot be expected to know the worse than worthlessness of some of its subordinate agents around this capital, or it would whip them with a lash of strong cords out of that temple of freedom which they are converting into a den of thieves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Or, perhaps, in harboring at this central point all the stupid, selfish, and greedy pretenders in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, it is acting upon the <name>Mapoleonic</name> order, when forming a hollow square--&#x0022;Savans and asses to the centre.&#x0022; Not many savans are there among these uniformed Confederate loafers and lazzaroni, but asses enough to as any </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> military expedition that was ever put on foot in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> or <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> &mdash; asses that seek to emulate the lion's roar with their dissonant bray, and, whilst the blooded horses are in the field, are always at home, fit only to be enclosed in a hollow square, which is hollow in more senses than <num value="1">one</num> when they are in its centre. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> But whilst we cannot expect the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> to scrape off at once all the barnacles which attach themselves to the good ship's bottom, we hope the time will come when it can accomplish that most desirable object.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>We hope that the jackasses, who are now holding their Carnival, will ere long have their Lent, and instead of eating out of gilded cribs in the metropolis, will <num value="1">one</num> day be harnessed to the rugged cars of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Our satisfaction in expressing these sentiments is somewhat marred by the reflection that the objects of our animadversions will never take what we say to themselves; for their hides are so thick with self-conceit and arrogance that no spear of mortal fashioning could ever penetrate them, or if it could, would hurt a carcase which was never conscious of sensibility.--Like the swine, they have no blood in any surface part of their systems, and we should as soon think of putting a hog to death with the prick of a steel pen, as disturbing their composure with letting them know what the public think of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>But an avenging <persName n="Nemesis,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Nemesis,nomatch:0"><surname>Nemesis</surname></persName> is on the heels of these pseudo sons of <persName n="Mars,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Mars,nomatch:0"><surname>Mars</surname></persName>, &#x0022;soldiers in peace and citizens in war,&#x0022; who dare to treat with contumely and contempt the suffering and wounded heroes of our country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The lions of this war will live in history, and so will the jackasses clothed in the <rs n="lion skin" type="product">lion's skin</rs>, and penned up in a hollow square, where honest men will laugh and jeer at the absurd and sorry spectacle till the end of time. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> --We paid a visit to this hospital, situated on the corner of <address><street n="Main Street">Main</street></address> and <address><street n="25 Street">25th streets</street></address>, a few days ago, for the purpose of getting some insight into the manner in which such establishments are conducted, having been previously profoundly ignorant upon that subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>It is, as our readers are probably aware, under the charge of <rs type="role">Dr.</rs> A. C. <rs n="Fox" type="nativeamerican">Fox</rs>, of <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>, a gentleman of acknowledged skill in his profession, and of most polite and agreeable manners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>In this latter respect we found the reputation of the establishment fully sustained by his assistants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>In company with <rs type="role">Dr.</rs> F. we made the tour of the building, and publish this as the result of our observations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> The hospital is a large and commodious building, having been originally <num value="1">one</num> of those immense tobacco factories for which <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> has been so long famous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>It is admirably ventilated, the numerous windows and doors affording every facility for that purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The wards are entirely separate and distinct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The beds are excellent, and are all supplied with hair mattresses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Baths, both shower and plunge, have been fitted up for the use of such patients as are in a condition to use them, and are supplied with a plentiful stream of running water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>They are, indeed, the best baths we know of in the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>A reading desk, upon which all the morning papers are laid every morning, is placed for the benefit of the patients, and to those who are recovering it must be a source of infinite pleasure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>We were shown into the operating room, which is fitted up in the best hospital style for operating; but we cannot say we felt much pleasure at the sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>On the contrary, we fancied that we had a pain in the leg the whole time we were in the room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>We understand, however, that modern improvements have greatly diminished the pain of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>A man's leg is cut off and all the arteries are tied up in a few minutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>We passed next through the linen room, where the linen of the hospital is kept, and thence to the drug store.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The latter is superintended by <num value="1">one</num> of the most accomplished chemists in the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>There is also a hall for religious services attached to the hospital &mdash; a most important provision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>The kitchen is remarkable for the cleanly style in which it is kept. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/> Indeed, an air of cleanliness and comfort regius throughout the establishment, and at once strikes the eye of the visitor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>It must have been a herculean task to have brought a tobacco factory to that state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>The floors, we understood, were at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> stained deeply with tobacco and licorice, besides being other-wise very dirty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>But all this has been rectified, and no private parlor is now neater than the rooms of the <rs>Howard</rs>.
