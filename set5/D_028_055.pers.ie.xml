<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> Now, here is &#x0022;a angel,&#x0022; a regular angel, with the wings, as <persName n="Thackeray,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Thackeray,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Thackeray</surname></persName> would say, sprouting visibly from his shoulders an immaculate, semi-hating angel, too good for this world, and deserving to be prime minister in some better and brighter sphere than this fallen planet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>This unhappy war, most sad for <persName><roleName n="Earl">Earl</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName> to think of, and truly afflicting to all lovers of humanity; but then, drying his eyes, there is this consolation, quoth the angel, that the reign of sin and Satan, in the shape of human slavery, will thereby come to an end. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> Is it not possible, we ask with profound reverence, we should abhor ourselves for indulging such a suspicion, were it not sanctioned by high authority, that Satan sometimes appears in the form of an angel of light?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>Is he ever so execrable, is he ever so disgusting, as in that particular form?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>When he walks out in his proper uniform, with his sooty countenance, his horns and tail, cloven feet and pitchfork, he makes a much less revolting appearance in every way than when he dresses himself in the &#x0022;livery of the <rs type="place">Court of Heaven</rs>&#x0022; and undertakes to reprove sin. It is worthy of observation, that whilst the <rs>Divine Founder</rs> of our Faith never uttered a word against slavery, but, on the contrary, enjoined servants to be obedient to their masters, the most fearful denunciations that ever fell from his lips were directed against hypocrisy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>What a dreadful suspicion it is that <persName n="Russell,Lord,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="default:Russell,John,,,"><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName> may be the greatest hypocrite on the face of the earth ! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> If slavery be the sum of all wickedness and crime, whose approaching over throw fills his benevolent soul with such seraphic satisfaction, why has he advised his countrymen that they may sell muskets, shells, gunpowder and cannon to the party that perpetrates, equally with the party that opposes, that most horrible crime?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>that they may sell ships like the <rs>Alabama</rs> to those outrageous criminals, to worry and devour and drive from the ocean the nation which is laboring to overthrow the great sin against humanity?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Is it possible that the sin and iniquity and total depravity of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> having ships and commerce is an even more hideous and appalling crime in the <rs>British</rs> code of morality than human slavery? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> The ingenuous angel admits that &#x0022;it was the crime of <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs> to introduce slavery to <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>&#x0022;--a fact which is too evident for even <placeName reg="Exeter Hall">Exeter Hall</placeName> to deny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Yes, it was their act, against which <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> in vain remonstrated; and, being so, why do they make us responsible for their crime?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/><hi rend="italics">We</hi> did not bring the negroes here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>If there was a crime in bringing them, <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs> were the criminals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>But here they are, brought by those <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs>, as <persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="nearbymention:Russell,John,,,"><surname>Russell</surname></persName> himself admits; here <rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs> planted the tree, and watered and nourished it until generation has succeeded generation, and the institution has become so interwoven with the whole framework of society that to pull it down is to overturn the whole social structure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>We have done the best we could with the people forced upon us by the <rs>British Government</rs>; we have transformed them from naked heathens and cannibals to worshippers of the true <name n="God" type="God">God</name>; we have fed and treated them well, as their rapid multiplication proves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>If the act of <persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="nearbymention:Russell,John,,,"><surname>Russell</surname></persName>'s <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> slave-trading ancestors was a crime, why must we, the innocent inheritors of the property purchased by our ancestors from his ancestors, be made to suffer the penalty of their iniquity?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Or, if it is our duty to give up the slaves, give us back the consideration, <persName n="Russell,Lord,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="default:Russell,John,,,"><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName>, which our ancestors paid to your ancestors for them, and which your countrymen have put into their own pockets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>If <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> slavery is a crime, let <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> disgorge all the ill gotten gains which she has derived from that system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>If it is our duty to give up slavery and all the wealth of which it is the foundation, then it is the duty of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> to give up all the accumulated treasures which our slave labor has poured into the lap of her commerce and manufactures, so that no living man, no corporation, no city in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, shall continue to own a dollar's worth of property of any kind which is the product of the slave trade or of slave labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Does <persName n="Russell,Lord,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="default:Russell,John,,,"><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName> hold that the original <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> thief, and the principal receiver of the profits of the stolen goods, is the only criminal who is not to do penance for the crime? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> When this exemplary and philanthropical and pious peer rejoices that this unhappy war will bring this consolation to all saints, that it will put an end to the great sin and crime of slaveholding in <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, is it possible that, by that shuffling, canting, Pecksniffian talk, he simply means that all pious, excellent, holy persons in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> will be consoled for the afflictions that <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName> has suffered in this war by her future inability, in consequence of the abolition of slavery, to raise any more cotton and have any more commerce?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>We know, well enough, that if <rs n="African" type="ethnic">Africans</rs> are going voluntarily to cultivate the soil in the <rs>Southern States</rs>, to become industrious, systematic, productive laborers, it will be the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> example of the kind in the whole history of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>He knows that the only result of such experiments is the ruin not only of the soil, but of the <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> race, who, left to themselves, uniformly relapse into depravity and barbarism.--Yet, with this knowledge of this fact, attested by all history, he expects us to believe that it is the probable extinction of the &#x0022;crime of slavery,&#x0022; and not the probable extinction of the property of <placeName reg="America, Limburg, Nederland" key="tgn,1047611">America</placeName>, which fills his soul with joy and gladness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>It is the disappearance of a foul blot upon humanity, not the disappearance of a commercial and manufacturing rival from the world, that transports his sainted soul with holy rapture.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/> &#x0022;Fasting, in order to prayer, is to be measured by the proportions of the times of prayer; that is, it ought to be a total fast from all things, during the solemnity, unless a probable necessity intervene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>Thus, the <rs n="Jewish" type="religion">Jews</rs> ate nothing upon the <name>Sabbath</name> days till their great offices were performed; that is, about the <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> hour: and <placeName key="tgn,2055458" n="1.000 3" reg="saint peter, nicollet, minnesota">St. Peter</placeName> used it as an argument that the apostles in Petticoat were not drunk, because it was but the <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> hour of the day; of such a day, in which it was not lawful to eat or drink till the <num value="6" type="ordinal">sixth</num> hour; and the <rs n="Jewish" type="religion">Jews</rs> were offended <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> at the disciples for plucking the ears of corn on the <name>Sabbath</name>, early in the morning, because it was before the time in which, by their customs, they esteemed it lawful to break their fast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>And further, upon days of humiliation, which are designed to be spent wholly in devotion, and for the averting of <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> judgment, (if they were imminent,) fasting is commanded, together with prayer: commanded (I say) by the church to this end: that the spirit might be clearer and more angelical, when it is quitted, in some proportions, from the loads of flesh.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>Fasting, as it is instrumental to prayer, must be attended with other aids of the like virtue and efficacy; such as are removing, for the time, all worldly cares and secular business: and, therefore, our blessed Saviour enfolds these parts within the same caution: &#x0027;Take heed, lest your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and the cares of this world, and that day overtake you unawares.&#x0027; To which add alms; for upon the wings of fasting and alms holy prayer infallibly mounts up to heaven. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/> &#x0022;Fasting, designed for repentance, must be ever joined with an extreme care that we fast from sin; for there is no greater folly or indecency in the world than to commit that for which I am now judging and condemning myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>This is the best fast, and the other may serve to promote the interest of this by increasing the disaffection to it and multiplying arguments against it. He that fasts for repentance must, during that solemnity, abstain from all bodily delights and the sensuality of all his senses and his appetites; for a man must not, when he mourns in his fast, be merry in his sport; weep at dinner and laugh all day after; have a silence in his kitchen and music in his chamber; judge the stomach and feast the other senses. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/> &#x0022;Let not intemperance be the prologue or the epilogue to your fast, lest the fast be so far from taking off anything of the sin that it be an occasion to increase it; and, therefore, when the fast is done, be careful that no supervening act of gluttony or excessive drinking unhallow the religion of the past day; but eat temperately, according to the proportion of other meals, lest gluttony keep either of the gates to abstinence.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/> Much might be added from the same and other authorities showing that fasting is but an instrument to an end, and that it is the individual repentance of every man seeking pardon through our <persName n="Christ,Lord,Jesus,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="default:Christ,Jesus,,,"><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Jesus</foreName> <surname>Christ</surname></persName> for his own sins, to which the people are called.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>And, surely, never was there an hour in the history of man, or in the life of any man now living in this country, when there was more need to invoke the forgiveness and the favor of Almighty <name n="God" type="God">God</name>. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>The fall of <placeName reg="Sunny Point, Brunswick, North Carolina" key="tgn,2704307">Fort Anderson</placeName> completed the work which was begun with the capture of <placeName key="tgn,6002050" n="1.000 164" reg="fort fisher, new hanover, north carolina">Fort Fisher</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>The enemy, finding their gunboats powerless against this strong work, landed a large force on the west bank of the river, with the view of turning the fort and taking it in the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>This rendered its evacuation necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>At <time value="4oclock">4 o'clock</time> in the morning it was blown up, and the garrison made their way to the main body of our army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>Subsequently there was skirmishing a few miles below <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName>, and on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> the evacuation of the place began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>Before leaving, our forces removed and destroyed all public property of every kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>The wharves, warehouses, &#x0026;c., on the west bank of the river were in flames; and there were <num value="2">two</num> fires raging on the east bank, fed by rosin, spirits of turpentine, cotton, &#x0026;c. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/> Several <num value="1000">thousand</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisoners had <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> been carried down to be exchanged.--They were all brought off and sent up the country, with the exception of <num value="65">sixty-five</num>, who were too sick to be removed, and were, of course, left behind. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/> I learn that our authorities, before leaving the town, seized and brought off all the horses, wagons, negro men, and all the white men between the ages of <num value="17">seventeen</num> and <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure>, that they could get.

These were captured; how or where, I do not know. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>The place was defended to the last, and only evacuated when the pressure of an overwhelming force of the enemy rendered it necessary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>At <num value="1">one</num> time, they were seen advancing along the <placeName reg="Corduroy, Elk, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2256700">Corduroy</placeName> road, which runs through the rice fields on the west bank of the river.--A few shells from <num value="1">one</num> of our batteries posted at the foot of <address><street n="Market street">Market street</street></address> caused them to beat a hasty retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>It is said that an enterprising <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> mounted the <orgName>office of the Superintendent</orgName> of the <rs>Manchester</rs> railroad and attempted to hoist his national flag; but while he was thus engaged was picked off by <num value="1">one</num> of our artillerists or sharpshooters, I do not remember which. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>The enemy made their appearance in the town as our <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName> was going out, and made close pursuit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>There was active skirmishing at <persName n="Smith,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00162" reg="nearbymention:Smith,James,T.,,"><surname>Smith</surname></persName>'s <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>, <placeName><distance reg="2miles">two miles</distance> <offset>north</offset> of  <placeName reg="Wilmington, New Hanover, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014631">Wilmington</placeName></placeName>; but the enemy were repulsed and the bridge destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/>They managed to cross in some way, however, and when our men arrived at the bridge over the <rs>Northeast</rs> river, were close behind them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>Skirmishing ensued, but the enemy were again driven back, and our men crossed to the north bank of the river and commenced to destroy the railroad and pontoon bridges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="340"/>The enemy attempted to prevent this, and a brisk fire ensued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>The roar of artillery and the sharp rattle of musketry were incessant till a late hour in the night.--The railroad bridge was burned, but the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> contrived to fix it up in some way, so as to cross the river on it early <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>. The pontoon bridge was cut loose from the south side and swung around beyond the reach of the enemy; but they afterwards got possession of it and speedily repaired it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/> On <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time>, the wagon trains began to move from the river, and on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> the whole army passed up the road.
