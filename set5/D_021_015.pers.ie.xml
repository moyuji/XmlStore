<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/> --No part of the late <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> feels the war more severely than the great Northwest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/>It is almost exclusively agricultural; and its productions are the cereals alone, those which yield the smallest profit to the farmer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>By means of the cheap navigation of the <placeName reg="Ohio River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7014265">Ohio</placeName>, <placeName key="tgn,7022231" n="1.000 1584" reg="mississippi river">Mississippi</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Missouri River, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7014086">Missouri rivers</placeName>, its farmers could deliver their grain at New Orleans for exportation at a very small cost; and the immense quantity sent thither was indicated by the fact that next to New York, itself exporting more grain than anything else, New Orleans was the largest exporting city in the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>The cheap transportation they enjoyed for their grain enabled them to pocket very fair not prices from the sale of it; and the same great avenues of navigation brought merchandise in return to them very nearly at manufacturers' prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>Thus, the farmers of the <rs>Northwest</rs> enjoyed the <num value="2">two</num> essential advantages for a profitable agriculture, that of receiving nearly last prices for their grain, and of obtaining their merchandise at nearly <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> prices.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>It is true that they enjoyed several lines of railway for reaching the <rs>Eastern</rs> markets; but these, by multiplying the means of transportation, served only to cheapen it, while totally inadequate of themselves to accommodate the mighty bulk of Western trade. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/> They sold, moreover, a great deal of grain, in the form of flour or most, to the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>The culture of cotton, in these last, paid <num value="4">four</num> or <measure n="500dollars" type="currency">five hundred dollars</measure> per annum for each hand; while that of grain paid only about <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> that sum. The case was similar as to sugar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>Of course the tendency of this circumstance was to throw the whole force of the planter upon the profitable staples, and to produce a demand throughout the cotton and sugar States for Northwestern farm products.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>It is said that <num value="75000000">seventy-five millions</num> of pounds of bacon alone were thus supplied from this quarter to the <rs>South</rs>, and of course we are to infer that the grain furnished was in commensurate amount.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>The war has put a stop to this vast demand from the <rs>South</rs>, and cut off the <rs>Northwest</rs> from its, largest and most profitable market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>It can only export produce now by way of the lakes and by railroads through New York, over routes doubly as expensive as the natural channels of great rivers, the lake routes closed in winter, and the railways inadequate to the business, and charging their own prices. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/> The South, instead of starving, is simply raising less cotton and sugar, and growing more corn, hogs, and cattle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>It was the silliest and shallowest experimenter embarked upon by a sensible people; that of starving their own best customers by depriving themselves of their own best market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>They find to their confusion that they are the greatest sufferers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>The delusion that we are to be starved has at last been given up; and the <rs>Northwest</rs> at least are sighing in their secret hearts for peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>They are the starved party, starving for want of that remuneration for labor, which brings thrift, wealth and prosperity, and the want of which brings poverty and distress. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/> The experiment has completely failed; so far as the expected exhaustion of the <rs>South</rs> is concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>Our land teems with all articles of native production; there is scarcity in nothing except in things that were imported, among which the only necessary of life is salt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>There is no article which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have in surplus that we ourselves cannot also produce in equal superabundance; and, so far from the war teaching us our dependence upon that race, it has demonstrated to us precisely the opposite truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>In a little while we shall have supplied all deficiencies which our long habits of trade had led us to derive from the <rs>North</rs>; and the war is the only measure which could have produced that complete self-dependence which is to be its most happy consequence to the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/> The experience of the <rs>Northwest</rs> is only an aggravation of what is felt all over the <rs>North</rs> at the loss of Southern trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>Where <num value="2">two</num> communities are so extensively and multifariously engaged in mutual trade, as were these <num value="2">two</num> sections; the cessation of that trade cannot operate exclusively to the prejudice of <num value="1">one</num> of the parties only.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>On the contrary, where <num value="1">one</num> community are producers and the other merely manufacturers and carriers, the latter are sure to feel the effect most severely. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/> --There are <num value="2">two</num> elements of Southern society, and occupying opposite extremes in the social organization, on whose co-operation the <rs>North</rs> confidently calculated in the beginning of this war, both of which have signally disappointed our short-sighted enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/><num value="1">One</num> of them was the old. <orgName n="Union party" type="party">Union party</orgName>, composed of gentlemen who, possessing a large, if not the largest, amount of slave property in the <rs>South</rs>, was yet ardently attached to the old Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>It is needless to say that in this calculation they have been signally disappointed, for as soon as the real designs of the <rs>Lincoln</rs> despotism were understood by the <rs n="Unionist" type="political">Unionists</rs>, they became the most fixed, unforgiving, and irreconcilable enemies of a reconstruction of the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName> to be found in the whole <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/>Men who from their own magnanimity, and moderation, and stability of character are slow to suspect evil in others, never permit themselves to be deceived more than once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>Their confidence once lost is lost for ever; they can never be imposed upon by the same party again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>For that reason the <rs>Union</rs> men of the <rs>South</rs> have trampled all possibility of reconstruction under their feet, and are found through the whole length and breadth of the <rs>Confederacy</rs> a <q>&#x0022;stone wall&#x0022;</q> of indomitable resistance to the <rs>Northern</rs> invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>The other influence relied upon by the <name>Lincolnites</name> was the servile population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>But, in instead of co-operating with the enemy, it has never been more loyal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>In those rural districts where the servile population is most dense there is no need even of a patrol, and they are themselves the reliable protectors of the homes and property of their masters who are engaged in the war. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/> There are, however, men in all parts of the <rs>South</rs>, few in number, but dangerous in their capacities of mischief, who ought, if permitted to remain in the country, to be placed under the surveillance of a vigilant police, and, when detected, punished as their crimes deserve.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>It cannot be doubted that in this very city of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 10" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> there are instruments and allies of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00039" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,John,K.,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, who neglect no opportunity to injure the <rs>Southern</rs> cause by giving valuable information to the enemy, and by such other means of mischief as are in their power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>Cases have occurred over and over again in which the enemy has obtained knowledge of plans of our own Government which could not have been obtained except from persons actually in the employment of that Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>There are individuals abroad in this city whom it is difficult it not impossible to prove anything against, but who are believed by every <num value="1">one</num> who knows them to be subtle and deadly enemies of the <rs>Southern</rs> cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>Such men ought at least to be watched, and their operation of <sic>mishief,</sic> if they cannot be entirely prevented, in some measure curtailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>For this purpose a corps of secret agents ought to be appointed, composed of men of shrewdness, intelligence, and character, who can appreciate the interests involved in this matter, and who will have every motive to watchfulness and diligence in ferreting out these dark and smoky </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/>
