<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> <hi rend="smallcaps">Horack.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> Some days ago I published information regarding the winter quarters of our army, based upon the statement of a gentleman whom I supposed correctly informed upon all points connected with the disposition of troops, but I have since learned from better authority that my publication was premature, and furthermore, that it was substantially incorrect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/><num value="10000">Ten thousand</num> rumors upon the subject are floating on the current of public talk; but they are merely exaggerated reports upon a matter no <num value="1">one</num> beyond our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> can even predicates an opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>In my college days I recollect to have read, I think in <persName><foreName>Terrence</foreName></persName>, the saying, <q>&#x0022;<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fre">Insita lomixibus libide sleadi de industria rumores</foreign></hi>&#x0022;</q>--men have in them a natural propensity for spreading rumors. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> The truth of the phrase was never more apparent than at present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Men take very diminutive facts, blow them up into unusual dimensions, then set them afloat,--as school-boys inflates bladders, and use them for footballs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>It takes good sound sense to tell truth from falsehood, and sometimes sharp cross questioning to bring out true evidence in the <unclear>c se.</unclear> If a person happens to be misled, even in a single instance no matter about the circumstances, woe be unto him!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>He has committed the unpardonable offence of circulating what he betted to be true, but which proved to be untrue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Run your bodkin into him Madame Public; and you, old fogies, civil or military, spit your venom at him, or guillotine him on the spot!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Like the victim of <q>&#x0022;all Foots day&#x0022;</q> or the unfortunate during <q>&#x0022;Carnival week,&#x0022;</q> no <num value="1">one</num> has any charity for the man who gets misted into error.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>Nineteenths of the world will rather encourage the fault than otherwise, and if possible put in a few private ricks to Assist him on the highway to the d &mdash; l. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> I have written all these moral reflections over the fact that I was misled, after leaving <placeName reg="Centreville, Queen Annes, Maryland" key="tgn,2046543">Centreville</placeName>, into the statement that our army had gone into winter quarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Speaking collectively, exactly the riverside is true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>A portion of the troops have been assigned more favorable positions, but only a small portion are now engaged in the <q>&#x0022;hutting&#x0022;</q> process.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Although the present prospect is quiet enough, no <num value="1">one</num> can say what the winter will bring forth &mdash; whether it will be quietly spent in camp, or whether a more active policy will be inaugurated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>At present winter exists only in name, but we have precedents upon which to found an opinion that there may be had weather before spring Good, comfortable quarters must be provided for our volunteers during the chilly storms of winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>No matter what course may be pursued in the conduct of the war &mdash; act on the defensive or offensive &mdash; the health and comfort of the men demand that proper shelter should be given them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> If <persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> has decided to assume the aggressive, there is no reason in the world why the men should not be allowed the privilege of making log huts to live in until he is ready to lead them into the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>If he has decided to act upon the passive policy that has been inaugurated since the <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">battle of Manassas</rs>, it is culpable to keep the men in weak, flimsy tents, sleeping upon &mdash; the wet, damp ground, while the icy wind whistles the <q>&#x0022;dead march&#x0022;</q> around their ears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>Abuse a man, imperil his health and life, treat a volunteer like a senseless machine, and then ask him to enlist immediately when <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> hard service has expired?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>A sense of duty may drive him to the defence of his country, but he will eater the army with the reluctance of a quarry slave scourged to his cell, rather than with the enthusiasm that is the life of an army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>It is by showing every man that he is loved, respected and cared for; by pointing out and guiding him in the path of duty, and not by shaking the rod of military law in <hi rend="italics">terrorun</hi> over his head, that a volunteer organization can be made effective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>Discipline must be preserved, and martial law executed, and I am well aware of the fact; yet, justices can be tempered according to the circumstances of guilt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>There is truth in the old Latin maxim, <q>&#x0022;<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="lat">Legis constructio non jacit injuriam.</foreign></hi>&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> Some writer, in speaking of rank and file heroes, says truly, <q>&#x0022;War is far from being an unmitigated calamity, to be compensated for only by the benignant results it in a means of reaching in a crisis where all other instrumentality fails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>On the contrary, war, at the very time of its prevention, brings out the good and noble as well as the baser qualities of human nature.&#x0022;</q>This is true to a greater extent than we are apt to perceive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>We lose sight of many manifestations of virtue by confining our gaze too exclusively to the principal actors on the stage, while we forget the mass; forgetting they are, after all, acting as individuals, and that the private soldier is exhibiting his personal character as truly as the <rs>General</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>How often is it we see the character of the former morally greater than the latter, and in precisely the same traits. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> We notice the commander in his tent at the midnight hour meeting the responsibilities of his position with unwearied fidelity, and we look upon him with admiration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>That same admiration is equally due to some solitary sentinel on the outpost, who, at that same midnight hour, is sleeplessly vigilant, feeling, perhaps, that the safety of his comrades depends upon his wakefulness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>We see the leader at the head of his column dashing gallantly into the fight, and we honor him for his bravery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Should we not also honor the private beside him, who, with steady step and firm determination, follows him into the fight?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>When we take a careful view of the whole force of our army, we are struck with the sublimity of the active sense of duty which actuates every man. The official reports tell us of the bravery and skill of <rs type="role" reg="General-Officer">General officers</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Letters read with tearful eyes in far off Southern homes, give the modest narrative of merit, as great in moral purity and in elevated motive, as if its author were not a private in the ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>The newspapers recount the adventures of the leaders, and send them out for the admiration of the world, or preserve them for the pen of history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Many a poor sister reads the simple story of her soldier-brother, or, in her chamber, pores over the letter of her lover with moistened eyes and emotions half of pleasure and half of grief.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>If the unwritten history of this war could only be told &mdash; if the many instances of individual virtue and patriotic heroism could be written, what an insight would it give us to the human heart! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> In the army of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> at the present moment, there is enrolled an amount of intelligence, conscientious conviction, earnestness of deliberate will consecrated to a holy cause, never, perhaps equalled in the history of <measure n="18centuries" type="date">eighteen centuries</measure>. The best blood, and the truest, most manly hearts of our Southern land, are enlisted in the defence of its honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>When we think of the chivalric noble men composing the rank and file of our army, how closely do we scan the character of the <rs>General</rs> upon whom the responsibility of their treatment rests.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> forgive the commander who neglects and misuses such men while in the field! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> And now I must draw my correspondence from the <q>&#x0022;Army of the <rs>Potomac</rs>&#x0022;</q> to a close.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>During the past <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> that I have remained within its lines my pen has been seldom idle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>I have gathered many a sheaf of useful knowledge and experience, and only regret that I have scattered tares in the public highway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>When <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <q>&#x0022;Bohemian&#x0022;</q> sat down to a quiet chat with his kind readers, he promised more than his poor abilities allowed him to accomplish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Why was it that the fair castle he planned turned out as tumble down an old building as ever shock a shutter!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>To use the well-known <unclear>met her</unclear> of <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName>, which heads this letter, a large jar was begun to be made, why as the wheel goes round does it turn out a paltry pitches With many thanks for the congratulations and presents sent me by kind friends, and with many excuses for my remissness in duty, I hasten to say good bye. And year hope, not long, for I ask the same dear readers to accompany me in further <q>&#x0022;Bohemian walks and talks&#x0022;</q> in other ways.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>I presume I have looked my last upon the broad fields of <placeName reg="Manassas plains">Manassas plains</placeName>, dotted with the white tents of our soldiers, and have done with the busy scenes of war on the line of the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>Well, they will still cling to memory, and fancy can repaint them as, &#x0022;In the new <hi rend="italics">role</hi> of student I work up the unwritten notes gathered during the campaign.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Like hundreds of others, I, too, can have dreams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>There are many facts connected with the management and mismanagement of the army which I have yet to write, but for the present they must remain in my note-book.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>There is a continual flow and ebb of public opinion, with respect to a battle.--Now, again, it is thought, there will not be <num value="1">one</num> on that line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>Thus, it will be seen what powerful motives these <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> have not to risk a decisive battle unless well assured of success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>But the <rs>Federals</rs> have had too many defeats with inferior numbers against them to face our troops in anything like a strong position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>If they could-fight us in detail before their own entrenchments, or draw us into weak situations, they might venture an engagement with their superior force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>I have no idea they will fight under other circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Indeed, the experience of the war shows this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>For these reasons I do think the <rs>Federal Commander</rs> will not attack <orgName n="army"><persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Johnston,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> at <placeName reg="Bowling Green, Warren, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013447">Bowling Green</placeName>, or in any other position where he might be likely to accept a general engagement, and, therefore, I adhere to the opinion that there will be no great battle in that part of the <rs>State</rs>, unless it be demanded from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, as the <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">battle of Manassas</rs> was. </p>

<head>The shinplaster evil &mdash; no specie to be had.</head>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/> Some months ago, when the banks suspended specie payment, the community was suddenly flooded with bills representing money, issued by parties responsible and irresponsible, generally upon very poor paper, and the people were forced to receive them for want of a better small currency in the ordinary transactions of business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>Had the practice been restricted to the issue of notes by persons or institutions competent to redeem their promises, it would have been borne with patience, notwithstanding its illegality, but myriads of little rags were thrust upon them, based upon no substantial foundation, and the lice and frogs of <placeName reg="Misr, Africa, " key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName> were scarcely more offensive than the nuisance thus created in our midst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/>After a long period of delay, the <rs>Grand Juries</rs> took the matter up, and the hopes of the people began to revive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>A long string of indictments, in <num value="2">two</num> different counts were held up to the public gaze, and some of us were verdant enough to suppose that the shinplaster evil would thenceforward be restricted to reasonable bounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>Time has roiled on, but up to this day no further steps have been taken, and the circulation of ragged and worthless paper has increased rather than diminished.--In one Court it was suddenly discovered that the indictments were null, in consequence of the disqualification of a Grand Juror, and the whole work had to be gone over with again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>It is to be hoped that the <name>Legislature</name> will authorize the banks to issue fractional parts of dollar notes, and legalize the issues of the corporation of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>By this means, and by the prompt enforcement of the law against illegal banking, we may find a relief from present evils, and at the same time have a safe and convenient currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/> Some days of the <name>Christmas</name> holidays had passed away in the regular routine of camp life, with nothing to commemorate them as days of festivity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>Growing tired of the everlasting sameness, several of us put our heads together in consultation as to what we should do to make the time hang less heavily on our hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>After various propositions had been made, some <num value="1">one</num> proposed the exploration of the cave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>The idea took like hot cakes, and a party was soon formed, when we proceeded, with the necessary paraphernalia, to the cave, which is about a mile from <placeName reg="Camp Robertson">Camp Robertson</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>Arriving at the cave, we proceeded to make our explorations Entering the aperture, we went forward, in a northerly direction, about <measure n="50feet" type="distance">fifty-feet</measure>; then turning to the right, and forcing ourselves through a hole in the huge masses of rock that enveloped us, we entered a chamber about <measure n="10feet" type="distance">ten feet</measure> in length, sloping down at an angle of nearly <num value="45">forty-five</num> degrees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>Passing through this the passage narrowed down to not more than <measure n="18inches" type="distance">eighteen inches</measure> in height and about the same in width.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>Sliding down, feet foremost, about <measure n="20feet" type="distance">twenty feet</measure>, we came to a part through which we could crawl on our hands and knees Proceeding in this way for some distance, we at length arrived at a place where we could walk with more ease.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>The passage continued to widen and become more spacious; still we had to be cautious, as there was a deep fissure on our left, where a single misstep would have precipitated us into the <unclear>darkness</unclear> beneath. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/> Our passage was suddenly cut off by a deep, circular cavity, which opened directly in our front; holding our lights over the yawning chasm, we peered down into the abyss beneath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>Nothing but blackness met our searching gaze.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/>Fixing a lantern to the end of rope, we had brought along, and lowering it some <num value="30">30</num> or <measure n="40feet" type="distance">40 feet</measure>, saw dimly by its reflection the rocks that covered the bottom.--Leaving it suspended in this position, we started back in search of a passage, through which we might obtain access into this subterranean chamber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>Finding a small passage which led down between huge masses of rock, (which seemed to have been rent asunder by some convulsion of nature,) we crawled into it and commenced the descent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>After winding about through various passages, we came to a hole through which we could see the lantern suspended far above us in the chamber we were seeking an entrance, and by dint of exertion, we worked our way up.--Here the sight that opened to our wandering and admiring gaze, amply repaid us for our toil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>Spare of the most beautiful kind, and carved out in the most fantastic shapes, hung down in clusters from the roof.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/>Further on the floor is covered with glittering projections, having much the appearance of a forest of emerald.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>It seemed as if we had suddenly bursts into the land of Fairies and Genii; and that by some magic influence, we had entered the <name>Palace</name> of Aladdin, or that by the aid of some fair <persName n="Ariadne,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00344" reg="mostcommon:Ariadne,nomatch:0"><surname>Ariadne</surname></persName>, we had baffled the watchfulness of the <rs>Dragon</rs> and entered the garden of <persName n="Hesperides,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00345" reg="mostcommon:Hesperides,nomatch:0"><surname>Hesperides</surname></persName>, where, before our eyes and within our reach, hung the golden apples in rich and shining clusters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="784"/>Upon a postal at <num value="1">one</num> extremity of the crystal chamber, was an exact imitation of a church organ, Its pipes carved and arranged in the nicest style.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="785"/>There, too, in our imaginative minds, we could fancy; the abode of the muses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="786"/>After feasting our eyes for some time on the gorgeous splendor that sparkled and shone around us on every side we turned to beat a retreat; &#x0022;<hi rend="italics">Facilis <unclear>descen </unclear></hi> <foreign lang="lat">decrai, sed revocure gradum,</foreign>&#x0022; muttered <num value="1">one</num> of the fellows as he kicked and scuffled among the sleep rocks, trying to make his exit, which was quite appropriate for the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="787"/>We at length reached the entrance and was soon safe again on <q>&#x0022;<foreign lang="lat">terro arma.</foreign>&#x0022;</q> </p>
