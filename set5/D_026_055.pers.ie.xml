<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>He seems to have been quite an angel of light compared to <persName n="Kilpatrick,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00144" reg="mostcommon:Kilpatrick,nomatch:0"><surname>Kilpatrick</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>The following story is told by him in his &#x0022;Campaigns,&#x0022; a book that, we believe, has nearly gone out of print.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>We tell it in our own words, not having the work before us. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>He bore orders for Tariton to halt and draw his men up in a single line on the side of the road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>He had hardly done so when <persName><foreName>Cornwallis</foreName></persName> and his staff came up, bringing with them <num value="2">two</num> inhabitants of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>He explained the cause of the order in a few words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/><num value="1">One</num> of the countrymen, in the presence of the other, had been robbed of articles of value by <num value="2">two</num> of the dragoons, who had entered his house contrary to the express orders of the <rs>General</rs> which forbade the troops to molest or plunder the inhabitants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>He had brought them both along that they might identify the robbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>This they soon did, and the property stolen was found upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>He is beyond the reach of his commander, so that he cannot be appealed to for justice, But there can be no doubt that, were it otherwise, any such appeal would be vain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>The very object of the expedition was to plunder and destroy private property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>He was born to afflict mankind, to distress women and children, and spread desolation around the land devoted to his animosities and inhumanities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>He is too great a satire on his race &mdash; too hideous a libel on humanity to be permitted or even to permit himself to confer as much of real happiness upon us as would be afforded by his coming in person to command his invading regiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>It is not in his line to originate any such thing as joy for mankind, and he can't afford to do it.
