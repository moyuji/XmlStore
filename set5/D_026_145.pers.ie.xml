<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/> We all recollect that worthy citizen of <placeName reg="Athens, Limestone, Alabama" key="tgn,2002521">Athens</placeName> who banished <persName n="Aristides,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00118" reg="mostcommon:Aristides,nomatch:0"><surname>Aristides</surname></persName> solely because it annoyed him to hear the epithet &#x0022;The Just&#x0022; constantly coupled with his name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>We have all been struck by this strange specimen of political liberty, and by the lack of judgment in its application.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>It was not because this undue notoriety given to the name of a citizen of the <rs>Republic</rs> might, after a time, prove dangerous, nor because the epithet of Just was questionable, that the worthy citizen of <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 48" reg="ellas">Greece</placeName> banished <persName n="Aristides,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00119" reg="mostcommon:Aristides,nomatch:0"><surname>Aristides</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/>He would not even discuss the matter; the epithet annoyed him, and that was enough to ostracise the unfortunate hearer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>In this we see an excess of liberty and a lack of political education. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/> Now, we are annoyed and irritated at hearing the words <rs>Abraham Lincoln</rs> and honesty always coupled together, but, being more generous than the excellent <rs n="Athenian" type="ethnic">Athenian</rs> citizen aforesaid, we propose, before ostracising honest <persName><foreName>Abe</foreName></persName> from the <placeName reg="Tunstall, New Kent, Virginia" key="tgn,7014664">White House</placeName>, to consider his right to the surname of &#x0022;Honest&#x0022; To call <num value="1">one</num> man honest out of a population of <num value="30000000">30,000,000</num> is not so much a compliment to him as a sarcasm upon all the rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="162"/>Let us look into his honesty and capability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="163"/>After <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> of patient silence we have a right, and it is more over our duty, <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00120" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, to examine your acts and show them to the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="164"/>You commenced by confiding the fate of our cause, the honor of our arms, and the lives of our sons, to men having no higher claim to such trusts than a host of voters at their command, whose support you coveted &mdash; in order to advance the welfare of the nation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="165"/> We have allowed you to further your political and personal interests, and to transform into heroes men whose inefficiency has swallowed up <num value="1000">thousands</num> of lives and <num value="1000000">millions</num> of dollars, so that you might be able to dazzle the eyes of the people with victories for more apparent than real.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/>We have permitted you to sacrifice tried patriots, whose popularity alarmed you, and whose energy disappointed your calculations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="167"/> We have allowed you to deceive the people; we have let you transform disgraceful defeats into victories; and we even made no outcry when you were reduced to beg exoneration for acts which have eternally disgraced the honor of our arms.--You have been unable either to foresee or to forestall anything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>What has become of the nation's enthusiasm?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>What have you done with the immense resources, unprecedented in history, that the nation has lavishly given you? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/> You are now appealing to conscription, and we will not enter into a discussion of the principle itself, but we will tell you that you should have foreseen that the day must come when you would need these men, and that you were to blame in not calling for them when the people's enthusiasm was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> aroused, when they certainly would not have been refused you. You are to blame, in as much as, through your incapacity and personal schemes, the necessity for such an appeal has become a question of public safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>You are to blame for depriving us of the services of the men whose popularity stimulated that enthusiasm. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/> You have told the country that both the rebellion and slavery were dead; you have told the people that the forces of the rebels were reduced by desertions, and that they could not be recruited, fed; or clothed; and yet you are forced to act upon the defensive, being threatened at all points. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/> Whenever you have directed the action of our troops, they have been uniformly successful; you have perpetually offered us the wretched spectacle of splendid resources and excellent chances of success sacrificed to incapacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>The only success which you came near attaining, but the credit of which we intend to take from you, is due to the incredible imaginativeness that you have displayed in describing facts.

<p> The result is everywhere the same, ridiculous and disastrous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>The sole concession we can make to your honesty is that you have improved upon the changes of base in <dateStruct value="1862--"><year reg="1862">1862</year></dateStruct>; you destroy fewer soldiers and burn less of the nation's property. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/> How is it that, after <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> of incomparable victories, according to <persName n="Halleck,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00128" reg="mostcommon:Halleck,nomatch:0"><surname>Halleck</surname></persName>'s facetious expression, &#x0022;unprecedented in the military history of nations,&#x0022; you are still pondering how to preserve the national capital and your bases of operation? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/> Is it as a reward for such success, for the achievement of such results, that you now ask the nation to pass a vote of confidence, and re-elect you for another and perhaps still another term? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/> In your inaugural address, you gave a very striking illustration of your peculiar honesty by virtually pledging yourself, in accordance with the well-known principles of the party which had elected you, not to serve a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> term; you did this in a manner which none of your supporters then misunderstood; but your words were evidently designed to hear a double meaning; so that, if you should find the sweets of office more enticing than you possibly anticipated, you might change your purpose without seeming to violate your promise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>Candid people will see in this a good deal more evidence of cunning than of honesty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/> The whole truth is this; you are leading the nation quietly to its destruction by deceiving the people as to the dangers which threaten it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/> You sacrificed the entire <rs>West</rs> for the capture of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>, and then you proclaim to the <num value="4">four</num> winds that the <rs>Mississippi</rs> is frees, while not a single steam-boat can navigate it without being attacked, or perhaps burned, and without every passenger having the fear of death or captivity before his eyes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/> To serve the ends of your cause, you have made a hero out of a man upon whom you have lavished everything, who had every obstacle removed from his path, and who was promptly furnished with reinforcements and supplies, while <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00129" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> could get none, and who has scarcely been able to hold, with the immense resources at his command, the ground which his predecessor gained in spite of you by his own talents. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/> You have offered us the distressing spectacle of the sacrifice of merit to caprice and personal political interests; and this in a republic, in the name and under the plea of popular sovereignty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/> And, to cap the climax, we are obliged to hear definitions like this: An unconditionally loyal man is <num value="1">one</num> who, although not satisfied with the measures taken by the <rs>Government</rs>, approves them all and gives his constant support. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/> It seems almost incredible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>Are we really the descendants of those disciples of <persName><foreName>Luther</foreName></persName> and <persName><foreName>Calvin</foreName></persName>, who, rather than subject their reason to an authority which they despised, preferred to expatriate themselves to these shores, where, through the agency of liberty, they founded our national greatness, which you are now striving to drown in a sea of cowardice and adulation, corruption and incompetency?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>Were our ancestors to visit the earth they would certainly be surprised to see that, <measure n="80years" type="date">eighty years</measure> after the revolution which gave life and liberty to the nation, the <rs>Lincoln</rs> party could find no other definition of loyalty than a blind submission to the decrees of the <rs>Government</rs>. </p>
