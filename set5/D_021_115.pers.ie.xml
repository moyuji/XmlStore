<head>The struggle.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/> The contest between the tyranny at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> and those confederated States which are struggling for the maintenance of their liberties has been drawn to each imminence, and the opposing armies to such proximity, that collisions of great magnitude are inevitable, and it is to be hoped not to be procrastinated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>These collisions must be of a decisive character, should they be adverse to our enemies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>Their operations can only be upheld by victories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>On our part, if adverse to us, they will only decide the question of the present occupancy of much of the <rs>Southern</rs> country, but they will not end the struggle or <q>&#x0022;crush the rebellion.&#x0022;</q> The people of the <rs>South</rs> will not submit even in this exigency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>They will continue to fight, and contesting every inch of ground, make the enemy pay dearly for all he occupies, while in the end he will be compelled to evacuate the country and leave us to direct <q>&#x0022;our own affairs after our own fashion.&#x0022;</q> This is the principle of the revolution of <num value="76">76</num> and of the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the old <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> adopted at the close of that revolution. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/> The declaration that Governments derive their just powers from the <q>&#x0022;consent of the governed,&#x0022;</q> and the principle of State sovereignty based upon it, are what we are struggling to maintain against the despotism which has utterly ignored them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>No people ever entered upon a war for the support of their constitutional rights with more courage and constancy than did the people of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>No people ever submitted to the wager of battle principles more dear so them than are those involved in this struggle to the <rs>Southern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>They will not surrender them, however adverse the fortunes of war. The event of the next few weeks are, in all human probability, to be of a magnitude greater than any which have preceded them since the war, but whatever their character, the principles for which we struggle cannot be surrendered, and must ultimately triumph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>They may terminate fatally to our enemies; but for us, if we be worthy the name of men and the blessings of freedom and equality with nations, we shall continue the struggle undaunted and undismayed by misfortune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>There is yet breadth of land enough left for hundreds of glorious battle-field, and enough gallant patriots marshalled for battle to free the land of oppression and oppressors. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/> We know the people of the <rs>South</rs>--we know them to be capable of deeds as glorious as any that adorn the history of nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>Let their own spirit and manhood have scope, and they will vindicate their country's honor and liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>Though the hour be dark, though a darker day is yet to break upon us, there is no such thing as subjecting them to the yoke of vassalage, and, leaders or no leaders, they will achieve their independence, and win for themselves imperishable renew in the history of the world. </p> </div3>

<head>The Virginia.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/> The news of the destruction of the <rs>Merrimac</rs> or <rs>Virginia</rs>, which was brought to this city yesterday by the crew of that vessel was exceedingly painful to this community.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>That vessel had achieved so much and given such proof of power, that the public relied upon her in the exigency of the day. She was looked to with the deepest interest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>When it was heard that <persName n="Norfolk,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00085" reg="mostcommon:Norfolk,nomatch:0"><surname>Norfolk</surname></persName> was occupied by the enemy, all asked with breathless anxiety, <q>&#x0022;What of the <rs>Virginia</rs>?&#x0022; </q> The answer came slowly, but terribly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/> Why she was destroyed, the column devoted to the latest news of the war contains all that we have been able to ascertain on this point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>Why she was not sent on some expedition destructive to the enemy, so that she might have ended her career in a manner worthy of its brilliant commencement, the history of the war must tell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>We have neither the ground nor heart for comment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>The <q>&#x0022;noblest <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> of them all&#x0022;</q> perished not more ignominiously. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/> Thus ends for the present our exploit on the water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>Our gallant naval officers and sailors will sadly turn away from the element they adore to the land, to pine in uncongenial service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>Untoward, indeed, has been the direction and the fall of the little navy of the <rs>South</rs>. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>According to the laws of war, as understood and acted upon by every nation on earth, his sentence was just, and he but suffered the penalty due to his crime. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/> We learn from the <hi rend="italics">Enquirer</hi> that <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00088" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> has determined to retaliate by hanging <persName n="Smithson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00089" reg="mostcommon:Smithson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Smithson</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, a banker in high repute, who has not even been charged with any offence in violation of the law of nations, and who was arrested only for furnishing relief to Confederate prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>It is difficult to conceive the meditation even of such a crime, and almost impossible to believe that it is seriously designed to perpetrate it. And yet we have seen enough of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00090" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, and the foul brood that surround him, to feel assured that he would stop short of no atrocity less horrible than this, which we conceive to be the most horrible of all. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/> It is easy to understand what <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00091" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> expects to gain by the contemplated crime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>He hopes to secure immunity for spies to come and go, into and from our lines without moderation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>He will be deceived in his calculations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>Every Federal spy taken within our lines will be hung, be the consequences what they may. He will not be able to intimidate our Government, and he can only inaugurate a war of indiscriminate slaughter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>Should he hang <persName n="Smithson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00092" reg="mostcommon:Smithson,nomatch:0"><surname>Smithson</surname></persName>, the deed will meet with instant retaliation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>Painful as it may be, such must be the inevitable result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>On his shoulders will rest the guilt of cold-blooded murder, with all its tremendous consequences.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>We are assured both ways, viz: that they are effectual, and that they are not. <num value="1">One</num> thing we do know &mdash; and that is, that if the defences of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James River</placeName> are not sufficient to keep back the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> gunboats, there is inexcusable inefficiency on the part of those whose duty it was to see that they were substantial and complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>There may be some policy unknown to the public in this; but on the face of it the fact is strange.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>It will be to all the most gratifying news, that the gunboats cannot pass our barriers, and the greatest credit will be awarded to those who have built them.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/> I think the policy of the whining, hypocritical, <unclear>p-</unclear> singing <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation is now about settled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>It is to subjugate the <rs>South</rs>, rob her people of all their property, of every sort, for the purpose of paying the almost fabulous <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> national debt, and to drive all true Southern men into exile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>To carry out this stupendous scheme of subjugation and robbery, it is important for the invaders to obtain possession of this city, and for the purpose of accomplishing this object a powerful, or at least a numerous army, under the command of the most skillful of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, is now actually within <placeName><distance reg="25miles">twenty-five miles</distance> of the <rs>Capital</rs></placeName> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States of America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>If <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> should fall into the hands of the enemy, such fall, although not fatal to the cause of Southern liberty and independence, would be a terrible blow to our cause, from the staggering effect of which it would require <num value="1000000">millions</num> of treasure and oceans of the best blood of the land to recover.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>Then it seems to me that every effort to the power of the <rs>Government</rs> and people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, and especially of the people of the beautiful city of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, should be made to drive back the insolent invader of our soil from our homes and our firesides. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>Before <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> can be desecrated by the tread of the insolent <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> invader, this army of brave Southrons must be overcome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>I believe that this Southron army is <hi rend="italics">almost</hi> invincible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>I <hi rend="italics">know</hi> that it will never permit the foe to resent this city until it is annihilated by overwhelming numbers is it not, then, of the utmost importance, if we would save <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, and save the lives of the brave men of the <orgName n="Army of the Peninsula" type="army">army of the Peninsula</orgName>, that every available able-bodied man should be brought into the great battle which seems to be impending?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>Property and liberty depend, in an immense degree, upon the result of the battle to be fought near this city within a few days, and which is liable to be precipitated at any moment, and yet you will find the extensive hotels and boarding houses, the splendid saloons, places of amusement, and the beautiful streets and public grounds of the beautiful city, all crowded with soldiers and able-bodied men capable of bearing arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/><num value="1000">Thousands</num> of these men are now here, while their brave companions in arms are enduring the hardships and privations of the camp, fighting almost daily, and liable to be brought into a general engagement with the enemy at any moment, which may decide the fate of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>. </p>
