<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> We have had a pleasant excitement in our camp in welcoming <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> refugees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/><num value="73">Seventy-three</num> came in, having travelled by night through the mountains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Driven from their homes by the tyranny which prevails in their State, they come to join those who have promised to redeem their firesides from the pollution of the oppressor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>It is most painful to listen to their stories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The conscription has been going on <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>, forcing brave men into the service of a cause which they hate, and of men for whom their only prayers are curses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The greater part of them had only time to bid a hurried goodbye to their families, and leaving them under the shadows of untold perils, to fly to the woods. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> <num value="1">One</num> man had lain hidden for <measure n="6weeks" type="date">six weeks</measure>, a few miles from his own house, waiting till the bloodhounds should leave him free to escape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>During that time he saw his home but twice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Several had been imprisoned and used the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> hours of their freedom in flight to seek revenge under the old flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>They came by mountain passes, following the paths which they knew, and then the <orgName n="North Star" type="newspaper">North star</orgName>.--In their night marches not a word was spoken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>Their hands on their knives and pistols, they came on, prepared to die rather than surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>They tell us that if we can reach <placeName key="tgn,7007825" n="1.000 6" reg="tennessee">Tennessee</placeName> with arms, <num value="4">four</num>-<num value=".2">fifths</num> of the male population will flock to our standard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>They promise us such a reception as only can be given by brave hearts long crushed beneath superior force to those who bring them rescue. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> No <num value="1">one</num> who has not talked with our East Tennesseeans has any idea of their holy hatred of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and of the sufferings they have undergone through their attachment to the <rs>Union</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Brave, honest, simple-hearted fellows, not the best material in the world for drilled and disciplined machine soldiers, but gifted with individual courage, and all excellent marksmen, they are as fine skirmishes as any General could ask. But their hearts are sickened by the long delays to which they are subjected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>The promises so often made, that they should be sent to defend their State with a strong army to back them up are yet unfulfilled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>They all have the strong local attachments to their homes which characterize mountaineers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>And many of them have had their hopes deferred till they sickened and died in despair. </p> </q><bibl n="New York Herald's Kentucky"></bibl></cit> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/> It is as well, perhaps, that in this estimate there was no mention of ships of war. What the <rs>Federal</rs> navy was at the commencement of the civil war we showed a few weeks ago; what it is now we can explain this morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>As the emergency was pressing, the <rs>Federal Government</rs> at once resolved on purchasing a whole fleet of vessels from the mercantile marine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>They spent on this service about a <num value="1000000.5">million and a half</num> of money, and bought up apparently every floating thing at hand that would carry a gun or <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>They did not even confine themselves to steamers, but snapped up old sailing brigs, barks and schooners, which they added to packet vessels tugs, and ferry-boats, and so <q>&#x0022;reconstructed&#x0022;</q> their navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>That navy, therefore, which <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> ago consisted of about half a dozen serviceable frigates, and twice as many serviceable sloops, now comprises, in addition, <num value="35">35</num> paddle-wheel steamers, <num value="43">43</num> screw steamers, <num value="13">13</num> ships, <num value="18">18</num> barks, and <num value="23">23</num> schooners, all picked up in the various Federal ports since <dateStruct value="-07-"><month reg="07">July</month></dateStruct> last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>This, as far as the ships-of-war go, is the force on which they rely to contend against a navy of a <num value="1000">thousand</num> vessels, including <num value="80">80</num> ships of the line, <num value="100">100</num> powerful frigates, and swarms of smaller craft admirably built and armed. </p> </q><bibl n="The London Times"></bibl></cit>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>A dispatch from the <rs>Admiralty</rs> could double or treble it at the shortest notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>As to reinforcing such a marine by purchased merchantmen, we could add a <num value="1000">thousand</num> steamers to it in a month, if the idea could be entertained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>As it is, we are going rather on the opposite tack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>If the good people of the <rs>Northern States</rs> will but look at the naval intelligence given in these columns they will see that, instead of buying, we are selling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>A very pretty little fleet of frigates and sloops is just now on sale at our dockyards, most of them newer and better vessels than those which formed the sailing navy of <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName> a few months back, and all infinitely superior to the bargains by which it has since been increased.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>This survey, too, will materially assist us in appreciating the grand scheme of sweeping us from the ocean by the guns of <num value="6000">6,000</num> privateers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>If the <rs>North</rs> <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs>, acting under the strongest stimulus, and with a prodigality of outlay beyond all bounds, have only been able to equip and arm some <num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num> merchantmen of all descriptions in the course of <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>--not half of these being seaworthy &mdash; we may guess what success they would experience in turning out about <num value="40">forty</num> times that number to sweep <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> from the ocean </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/> But there is a good deal more to be said on this point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>The <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> here, as everywhere else, are lost in dreams of a bygone age. It is clear that if much was to be done by privateering we, as being infinitely stronger, could do more than they.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>If such a game were to be played we could send out <num value="3">three</num> privateers to their <num value="1">one</num>, our ships being no longer inferior in selling qualities, but a match for any vessels in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>Our privateers would be as certain in the long run to beat theirs as our royal navy would to beat their ships of war. It is far more probable, however that the days of privateering would be found to be past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>Steam has now superseded sails, and steamers require not only greater original outlay and organization, but convenient ports for fitting and coaling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>A steam privateer could hardly keep the sea more than <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> at a time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>Our large mall packets would carry guns, and would be unassailable by any but ships of war, of which it is to be hoped <persName n="Milne,Admiral,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00042" reg="mostcommon:Milne,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Admiral">Admiral</roleName> <surname>Milne</surname></persName> would soon give a good account. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/> Then, again, the electric telegraph has no improved communications, that the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> <num value="8">eight</num> of a hostile sail on this side of the <rs>Atlantic</rs> would set every port and every guard ship on the alert; and supposing, after all, that an <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> privateer should succeed, as no doubt she might, in snapping up a prize, where is she to dispose of it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>She could not carry it into any <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> port, and our blockading squadrons would take good care that she got into no port of her own. The <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs>, in short, could never send out <q>&#x0022;<num value="6000">6,000</num> privateers,&#x0022;</q> nor a <num value="20" type="ordinal">twentieth</num> part of the number, if they did so, and privateering was found to be an effective service, we could beat them <unclear></unclear> at their own game that the possibility is that the system would carry her away in these <unclear></unclear> as it did in terrific past. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> <milestone unit="page" n="2"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>The most important items, probably, are regarding the question of finance, now troubling the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> rulers so seriously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>Innumerable plans have been suggested for the purpose of <q>&#x0022;raising the wind,&#x0022;</q> and day by day some new and brilliant scheme has been laid before Congress for its consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>A majority of these have been thrown aside on account of their complex and difficult provisions; some because the delegates of the New York, <placeName reg="Boston, Suffolk, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7013445">Boston</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> banks would not listen to them; others because they gave offence to the people of the <rs>Northwestern States</rs>, upon whom the heaviest part of their burden would fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>Considering the fact that the <rs>Federal Treasury</rs> is without a cent, and that the country is deeply in debt, these plans are somewhat remarkable on account of their boldness and their gigantic proportions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>When the whole country is growing at the <orgName n="Treasury Department" type="department">Treasury Department</orgName>, and looking suspiciously upon the enormous expense of the <rs>Government</rs>, <num value="1">one</num> would suppose the financial leaders would be a little modest in their demands upon the public purse; but on the contrary, they entertain schemes of a magnitude unheard of in history, and beside which the little speculation of the <name>Rothchilds</name>, in taking a mortgage upon the <rs>Ottoman Empire</rs>, and in the purchase of <placeName key="tgn,1000004" n="1.000 23" reg="asia">Palestine</placeName>, seems a mere retail business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>All of these, as I have said, have been thrown aside, and <num value="1">one</num> decided upon based on a system of direct taxation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>I have heard from a private source &mdash; and the newspaper accounts seem to corroborate it &mdash; that the following plan meets with the approval of the <rs>Cabinet</rs>: A bill has been reported by the <orgName n="Ways and Means Committee" type="committee">Committee of Ways and Means</orgName> to levy a direct tax of <measure n="150000000dollars" type="currency">one hundred and fifty million dollars</measure> <hi rend="italics">for a series of years,</hi> and upon this basis to issue immediately <hi rend="italics"><num value="500000000">five hundred million</num></hi> of Treasury notes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/> The objections to this plan are: <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>--The people of the <rs>Northwest</rs> are decidedly opposed to direct taxation; <num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num>--The banks are not disposed to receive the <name>Treasury</name> notes; <num value="3" type="ordinal">Third</num>--It is doubtful, in the face of such opposition, if they can be forced into circulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>It is evident, however, that if this bill meets with the public approval, it will furnish the means of greatly prolonging the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>His only relation was a niece, who lived as a servant with a green-grocer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>The girl always assisted her uncle as far as her means would permit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>When she learned of his death, which took place suddenly, she was on the point of marriage with a journeyman baker, to whom she had been long attached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>The nuptial day was fixed, but Suzette had not yet bought her wedding clothes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>She hastened to tell her lover that the wedding must be deferred; she wanted the price of her bridal finery to lay her uncle decently in the grave.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>Her mistress ridiculed the idea, and exhorted her to leave the old man to be buried by charity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>Suzette refused.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>The consequence was a quarrel, in which the young woman lost her place and her lover, who sided with her mistress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/>She hastened to the miserable garret where her uncle had expired, and by the sacrifice not only of the money for her wedding attire, but nearly all the rest of her slender wardrobe, she had the old man decently interred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>Her pious task fulfilled, she sat alone in her uncle's room weeping bitterly, when the master of her faithless lover, a good-looking young man, entered. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/> <q>&#x0022;But everybody will laugh at you for marrying a poor girl like me,&#x0022;</q> said Suzette. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/> Suzette hesitated no longer, but she wished to take with her a memorial of her deceased uncle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>It was a cat he had for many years.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>The old man was so fond of the animal that he determined that even death should not separate them; for he had her stuffed and placed her on the tester of his bed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="598"/> As Suzette took down puss, she uttered an exclamation of surprise at finding it so heavy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>The lover hastened to open the animal, when out fell a shower of gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>There were a <num value="1000">thousand</num> louis concealed in the body of the cat; and this sum, which the old miser had starved himself to amass, became the reward of the worthy girl and her disinterested lover. </p> </div3>
