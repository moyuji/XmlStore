<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/> It is well understood that the <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> has very much disappointed the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>He does well as a brutal guard over Confederate prisoners &mdash; shooting <num value="1">one</num> occasionally; he does better as a plunderer and general ruffian amongst an overrun Southern population, submitted to his mercy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>But in the deadly conflict, on the battle field, he is a failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>He has never stood up well to be shot at. The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have tried to force him into fight, as well as screen themselves from what they would rather avoid &mdash; the impetuous attack of Confederate soldiers &mdash; by placing him in the front of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>They have found, to their cost, that this expedient will not effect their object.--The negro, upon the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> shock of battle, changes front and rushes to the rear, spreading confusion and disorder in the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> ranks, and helping to that defeat which has always fallen upon them where they attempted thus to use him. With the unfavorable results of the experiments thus far made, the <orgName n="U. S.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/> Therefore, the <orgName n="U. S.

How they will demean themselves on the sea, we may well conjecture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>They cannot run there; but that they will prove to be either good sailors or good fighters on the water, is not at all probable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>It would certainly be no great achievement for the <rs>Confederate Captains</rs> on the seas, who have won for themselves such world-wide renown, to defeat a vessel thus manned, with almost any odds of guns and tonnage. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> would find, even were the <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> a white man &mdash; no better than themselves! --that he was not to be elevated suddenly to equality with themselves, let alone a chivalrous people, in the arts of war &mdash; after having been, for many generations, of a servile race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>If it were impossible in the white race, it is not less so in the black. --The sequel will prove that the poor <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs>, instead of giving any strength to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> by entering either branch of the warlike service, will be for him an element of weakness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>He is unreliable in war, and to any extent that the business of war is left to him there will be failure to the detriment of those who employ him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>The employment of the slaves of the <rs>South</rs>--beings in a great degree brought into bondage by the ancestors of these very <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>--for the purposes of spreading desolation and terror over the land, is a crime of such enormity that its penalties will be handed down from generation to generation of the posterity of the people who, in their heartless malice, have not hesitated to inaugurate these horrors. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/> There is another sad reflection in the paragraph we have quoted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>With an intellectual and physical organization which seemed to give the world assurance of a man, there was not only a deplorable deficiency of personal honor, but a personal fear of brute violence, which cowed his august intelligence at the feet, of every danger which threatened his bodily safety.
