<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>He contended that the keeping ofthis property, so peculiar to the <rs>East</rs>, was much safer in the custody of the <rs>Western</rs> people,who were denounced there as abolitionists, than if committed solely to the care of the noisy crowd who went about the streets of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, at unusual hours of the night.-- His people had been called submissionists; and if submission to the laws of the land made them liable to the charge, they were submissionists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>They admitted the right of revolution, which, however, ought to be exercised only after all measures of conciliation failed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>They would defend the people of the <rs>East</rs> against aggressions of their enemies, but they desired that justice should be done to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Hehad supposed when the <rs>Convention</rs> was called, that it was called to consider no other man the great question before the country.--He did not doubt the patriotism of the gentlemenfrom the <rs>Northwest</rs>, but if they would give us an Ordinance of Secession, pledging themselves to go before their people and urge the same, he was willing to go into the question of taxation, and concede to them what they asked, though he deemed it foreign to the purposes of the <rs>Convention</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>He said there was no gentleman here so stultified as not to recognize the fact that we were degraded by Northern aggressions; and he appealed to the <rs>Northwest</rs> to come up and redeem the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>, and whatever was right and proper would readily be conceded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The people of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>, to whom the gentleman from <persName n="Preston,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="mostcommon:Preston,nomatch:0"><surname>Preston</surname></persName> had alluded, might, by the inaction of this Convention, be driven to the necessity of bread riots, such as would be witnessed in the streets of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> and New York within the next <measure n="60days" type="date">sixty days</measure>. <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Fisher,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Fisher,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Fisher</surname></persName></hi> renewed the motion to lay the resolutions on the table, but withdrew it at the request of </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>He showed that the act calling the <rs>Convention</rs> contemplated a change in the organic law of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>He knew nothing of such a bargain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>He was not prepared to vote for a change in the organic law of the <rs>State</rs>, his people were interested in the great questions now agitating the nation; but he was willing to vote for a resolution to confide the subject to a committee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>They could report at an adjourned session of the <rs>Convention</rs>, for it was pretty well understood that the <rs>Convention</rs> would adjourn over. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>It was time it should be stopped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>He admitted that there were abolitionists in that quarter of the <rs>State</rs>, but expressed his belief that there were more in the city of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> than in his whole <orgName n="Congressional District" type="district">Congressional district</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>It was his belief that if something were not done in regard to the taxation of slave property, there would be a conflict &mdash; not between sections of the <rs>State</rs>--but a dire and irrepressible conflict between the laboring man and the slaveholder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>He strongly maintained the loyalty of <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>, and if a settlement could not be obtained, he would go for severing the <name>Gordian</name> knot which binds us to the <rs>Union</rs>; but he thought with a little time and patience the whole difficulty might be adjusted. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>if the <rs>Convention</rs> were to pass an Ordinance of Secession, he thought the organic law in respect to taxation ought to be changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The mercantile class of the <rs>East</rs>, he contended, bore a proportion of the taxes more than equivalent to the taxes paid by the <rs>West</rs>, of which they so much complained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>He was opposed to action upon the subject now. The Convention had no right to change the <rs>Constitution</rs> while <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> remained in the <rs>Union</rs>.-- He believed, that in the event of withdrawal, every slaveholder in <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Eastern</rs> Virginia</placeName> would willingly submit to an equalization of taxes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>He produced voluminous statistics of productions and trade, prepared with much care, and gathered from reliable sources, showing, by a comparison, that a deficiency in the <rs>South</rs> gave <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> a good market for her surplus, while, in the <rs>North</rs>, there could be no such market, for they had a surplus of their own.-- The experience of <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> was reviewed to show that prices were better under a low than under a high tariff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>Tobacco fell every time the tariff was raised, and whenever it was lowered tobacco rose in the market.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>He argued at length upon these points, touching upon the salt, iron, and coal interests and upon the trade in live stock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>It is protection from the <rs>North</rs> that our manufactures want.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>The people of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> were going into manufacturing operations, which would be developed under their system, and between the upper and nether millstones <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> would be crushed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>He argued that the manufacturers in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, unable to find protection at home, would transfer their extensive operations to the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>; and if <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> held aloof and remained with the <rs>North</rs>, the sceptre of manufacturing and commercial supremacy would saver be restored to her. </p> <milestone unit="column" n="3"/>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>The speaker drew a distinction between a condition of free trade with the <rs>South</rs> and free trade with the <rs>North</rs>, showing that in the former we were in less danger from foreign competition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/> <persName n="Stephens,Vice-President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00093" reg="mostcommon:Stephens,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Vice-President">Vice-President</roleName> <surname>Stephens</surname></persName> was enthusiastically received at <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta, Ga.</placeName>, <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>, on his way to <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>In a speech acknowledging the reception, he took occasion to explain the benefits of the <rs>Constitution</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> as contrasted with that of the <rs>Union</rs> from which they have withdrawn. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/> In the first place, Congress is forbidden from fostering <num value="1">one</num> branch of industry at the expense of another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>Thus, the merchant, the mechanic, the business man, and the laborer, are all placed upon the same footing in that respect--<num value="1">one</num> interest has no more claim to the protection of the <rs>Government</rs> than another: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/> and, therefore, honest labor can now work its own reward, by energy, industry, and perseverance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>This he considered a wise provision; it settled the question of protection forever. </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/> In the second place, the question of internal improvements was also settled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>Under the old Constitution, the improvements in <num value="1">one</num> State were made often at the expense of another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>Thus, for instance, <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, which had acquired the title of Empire State on account of her numerous improvements, had to pay several <num value="1000000">millions</num> of dollars to the <rs>General Government</rs>, by way of duties, on the very iron which she used in those improvements; and out of these duties money was taken to improve Northern harbors and rivers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>This was manifestly unjust, and was entirely obviated by the new Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>Under this <num value="1">one</num>, each section can make its own improvements, and is authorized to levy a tax upon those who are benefited by such improvements.--Thus, if <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> desires to improve her harbor, she can do so, and then levy a tax or duty upon the commerce benefited by such improvements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>If <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName> or New Orleans, or any other port, desires to make improvements, they all have the same privilege, and hence <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> will not have to pay for improving <placeName reg="Mobile harbor">Mobile harbor</placeName>, and <hi rend="italics">vice versa.</hi> In a word, those who receive the benefits, will have to pay for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>This provision he considered wise and just. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/> In the third place &mdash; and this is a very important improvement upon the old Constitution --the public money is protected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>We have been accustomed, in the old country, to hear the <rs>Presidents</rs> charged with the extravagance of the public expenditures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>Thus we had heard of the extravagances of <persName n="Adams,,John,Quincy,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00094" reg="default:Adams,John,Quincy,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>Quincy</foreName> <surname>Adams</surname></persName>, of <persName n="Jackson,,Andrew,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00095" reg="default:Jackson,Andrew,,,"><foreName>Andrew</foreName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, of <persName n="Buren,,Martin,,,Van" id="n-0001.0000.00000.00096" reg="expanded:Buren,Martin,,,"><foreName>Martin</foreName> <nameLink>Van</nameLink> <surname>Buren</surname></persName>, and, finally, of <persName n="Buchanan,,James,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00097" reg="default:Buchanan,James,,,"><foreName n="James">Jas.</foreName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName>; but these extravagances were not really chargeable to the presidents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>Their estimates of the probable expenditures had fallen short of the reality; thus, in some cases, the expenditures had increased <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3000000">three millions</num> over the estimates; and, in the case of <persName n="Buchanan,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00098" reg="nearbymention:Buchanan,James,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName>, as much as <num value="20000000">twenty millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>His estimates were <num value="60000000">sixty millions</num>, and yet Congress had appropriated <num value="80000000">eighty millions</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>It was generally the fault of the <rs>Congress</rs>, and the result of logrolling by the members.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>As, for instance, on the last night of a session, it frequently happened that in the hurry of finishing the business of the session, and passing the appropriation bill, some member would succeed in fastening upon it an appropriation of a <num value="1000000">million</num> here, and another a <num value="1000000">million</num> somewhere else-- all done without reflection, and often by an irresponsible body of men &mdash; men whose time of service was completed, and who would, perhaps, never return to Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>But all this is obviated by the new Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>The <orgName n="Confederate States Congress" type="congress">Congress of the Confederate States</orgName> can only make such appropriations as the <rs>President</rs> recommends; or, if they exceed these, it must be done by a vote of <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of both Houses. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/> Thus you see, my countrymen, that a very important point is gained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>You have the public treasury well guarded, and you can hold the <rs>President</rs> responsible at the ballot-box, if he rushes the <rs>Government</rs> into extravagant expenditures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>It makes no difference how much business a merchant transacts &mdash; no difference how much profit arises &mdash; if there are too many hands in the till, he is bound to be ruined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>As mercantile men, you will understand and appreciate this illustration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>And the illustration applies to the <rs>Government Treasury</rs> as well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>But that, I think, is now properly guarded &mdash; and so we have another improvement upon the old Constitution. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/> In the fourth place &mdash; and this is the principal and most important point of all &mdash; we have settled, and, I trust, settled forever, the great question which was the prime cause of our separation from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>--I mean the question of <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slavery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>The old Constitution set out with a wrong idea on this subject; it was based upon an erroneous principle; it was founded upon the idea that <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> slavery is wrong, and it looked forward to the ultimate extinction of that institution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>But time has proved the error, and we have corrected it in the new Constitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>We have based ours upon the principle of the inequality of races, and the principle is spreading &mdash; it is becoming appreciated and better understood; and though there are many even in the <rs>South</rs> who are still in the shell upon this subject, yet the day is not far distant when it will be generally understood and appreciated &mdash; not only in the <rs>South</rs>, but everywhere else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>The world is rapidly progressing in its views on this subject, and in a very few years we may witness great changes in respect to this institution. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>But this is not all. It will as certainly establish a superior nation in the <rs>South</rs>, and cripple and dwarf the enterprise and importance of the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>It is in this singular complication of circumstances: Its policy &mdash; almost vital to its existence &mdash; is that of war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/> &#x0022;<hi rend="smallcaps">The Revenue and Its Collection.</hi>--The last act of the <orgName n="U. S. Congress" type="Congress">United States Congress</orgName> was to largely increase the rates of duties upon importations; the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> act of the secession Confederation was to reduce them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>The natural effect of these <num value="2">two</num> diametrically opposite policies is to drive importations away from Northern ports and to send them to Southern ports, to avoid the duties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>There being no interior custom-houses, no collectors at the railroad stations, which extend from <num value="1">one</num> State to another, or upon the great rivers which sweep through Southern and Northern States, there is nothing to prevent these importations into Southern ports from being sent to every Northern city, and foreign articles may be introduced, and sold under the very noses of those who were to be protected by a high tariff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="368"/>to the exclusion of the home production.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="369"/>The Government can only pre- vent this by collecting duties at the mouth of Southern harbors, or establishing a chain of internal custom-houses all along the line which separates the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> from the seceding States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>The latter there is no authority for till Congress shall authorize it, and the expense would be enormous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>The former is attended with difficulties which are almost insurmountable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="372"/>It might be an easy matter to station national vessels at the mouth of the <placeName key="tgn,7022231" n="1.000 1584" reg="mississippi river">Mississippi</placeName>, or at the entrances to <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> and <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, but the collection districts are so numerous that all the unemployed vessels in the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Navy would be required to guard them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="373"/>How the difficulty is to be got over is not so clear, though the consequence to Northern commerce of allowing goods to enter Southern ports under low duties, or none at all, are very evident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="374"/>If secession is to be uninterred with, the only way to preserve the commerce of the <rs>North</rs> will be to open our ports free of duties.
