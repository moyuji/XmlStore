<head>The affair at <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> We are happy to perceive that our late repulse has had very little effect upon the public mind, of a disheartening character, in this part of the country at least.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Our exchanges speak of it as a disaster of course, but not such a disaster as does not admit of remedy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>The people are well aware that in such a struggle as this in which we are now engaged there must necessarily be altercations of good and evil fortune, and they have accordingly made up their minds to endure both extremities with equanimity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>As they were not shaken by the misfortunes of the last spring, so they were not unduly exalted by the victories of the summer, although the series was the most splendid of which history gives any account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Beating or beaten, the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> preserve the same composure, rejoicing of course in their success, but with a temperate joy; deploring their defeat, but always with a hopeful mind. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> Of the extent of the disaster to which our arms have been subjected, we are as yet unable to form an adequate conception.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>With their usual propensity to frantic exultation, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are already mad with joy, as we may judge from the specimen which we published from the <orgName n="New York Herald" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi></orgName> yesterday.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>It is long, however, since we placed any faith in anything coming from that quarter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The very fact that any statement appears <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in its columns is sufficient to render it doubtful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>The telegram itself, however, is sufficient to show that we have met with a considerable misfortune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>To have our chain of victories broken, is indeed, of itself, a sufficient misfortune, although the broken link be immediately restored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>But still we are all aware of the proneness of the telegraph to present the case at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in the worst aspect it is capable of wearing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>We have very great hopes that when sufficient time shall have elapsed to gather together all our different corps, it will be found that our losses are greatly exaggerated, both by the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> and ourselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>It was so after <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee">Fort Donelson</placeName>, when the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> said we had lost <measure n="15000" type="prisoners">15,000 prisoners</measure>, and when it turned out that the exact number taken was <num value="5000">5,000</num>, exclusive of prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>So it has been in every instance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>They always make out our losses at least <num value="3">three</num> times as great as they actually are, and set down their own at about half.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The arithmetic of <persName n="Pope,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Pope,nomatch:0"><surname>Pope</surname></persName> and <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> is even more liberal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>These gentlemen mingle the creations of their own fancy, with the calculations of the exact sums, in a manner which it is quite edifying to behold.--They have an aptitude for invention which is altogether unrivalled, and it is quite a misfortune to the lovers of fiction that neither of them commanded at <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>We should then have had a narrative not so entertaining perhaps, but quite as veridical as those of the <rs n="Arabian" type="ethnic">Arabian</rs> Nights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>In their absence, however, their places will be abundantly supplied by <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> and the letter writers, who will give us stories of the <hi rend="italics">fee, faw, fum</hi> order, until the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> themselves will cry, hold!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>enough! </p> 
<p> It is not by lying newspapers, however, or romancing correspondents, that countries can be conquered, or the fruits of victory gathered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>As far as we are able to see, we have been defeated, but not conquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>Our army still exists, and still has the power of resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The enemy himself has been so badly crippled by the bloody <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> <rs n="Battle of Corinth" type="battle">battle of Corinth</rs>, that he can be in no condition to follow up his victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Every moment of delay is a gain for us. There can be no doubt, from the character of our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, that the most strenuous exertions will be made to reorganize our forces and to restore our affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>That these exertions will be successful, there is every reason to hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The whole <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">State of Mississippi</placeName> is on foot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Guerrillas swarm from <num value="1">one</num> end of it to the other, and they will never let the war die out. Defeat will but stimulate exertion, for submission were worse than death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>It will not be thought of for a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>We may, therefore, regard this blow as a mere postponement of the liberation of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> We cannot close this article without warning the public against hasty judgments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Ill success on a particular occasion ought surely not to condemn any man, since the greatest <rs>Generals</rs> are liable to it. Let us hear everything he has to say, before we pass judgment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Let us not make another <persName n="Johnston,,Sydney,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="default:Johnston,Sydney,,,"><foreName>Sydney</foreName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName> blunder. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> The Federalists must be hard run for military leaders when they have to apply to that defeated, wounded, captured, played-out <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> brigand, <persName n="Garibaldi,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Garibaldi,nomatch:0"><surname>Garibaldi</surname></persName>, to come over and occupy a position in their army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>And in accepting such an invitation, <persName n="Garibaldi,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Garibaldi,nomatch:0"><surname>Garibaldi</surname></persName> gives the best proof that his fortunes are as desperate in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> as those of his new allies in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>We long ago regarded <persName n="Garibaldi,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Garibaldi,nomatch:0"><surname>Garibaldi</surname></persName> as a brave adventurer &mdash; nothing more &mdash; of execrable politics, and, as a military man, a huge humbug.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>This last fact has been made so evident by the circumstances of his late capture' that his best friends can hardly have the face to claim for him any quality of a leader except that valor which is common to soldiers as well as <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>He is not even a sagacious politician, or he would never have undertaken his last enterprise.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> The Red <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> act wisely, however, in transferring their battle-field from the Old World to the <rs>New</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>It is strange that the <unclear>instincts</unclear> of <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> sovereigns do not impel them to be as wise in their generation and to strengthen a cause in <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> in which is involved their own preservation. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>They are but the dying kick and groan of the mortally wounded lion &mdash; the last agony of the rebellion &mdash; in which there is the appearance of resuscitation and renewed vigor, but only the appearance, for its vital force is expending and exhausting itself in the final struggle. &#x0022;</q> It says: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> The people of the <rs>Southern States</rs> know by this time that we are terribly in earnest in the prosecution of the war for the <rs>Union</rs>, and that, though <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> of the <rs>Northern</rs> people do not desire to meddle with any <orgName n="Southern Institution" type="institution">Southern institution</orgName>, yet if slavery is found to stand in the way of the success of our arms, or if its destruction should appear to materially aid us in the struggle, it will not be spared, and there will be but little hesitation in carrying out the programme laid down in the proclamation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>It is a humane warning on the part of the <rs>President</rs>, to which thoughtful men at the <rs>South</rs> will take heed, notwithstanding the ebullitions of passion from their press and their halls of legislation. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/> No matter what may be now <unclear>threat </unclear> on their part, it is not in human nature, and least of all in the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> type of it, to carry on a hopeless war, when it is once demonstrated to be of that character, especially in the terribly adverse circumstances under which the rebel leaders would be compelled to continue the struggle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The condition of the insurgent army is deplorable, being not only without sufficient stores of food, but destitute of clothing and shoes at the approach of winter, and without the slightest chance of obtaining any adequate supply of these essential articles, to say nothing of salt, medicines, arms, ammunition, and other necessaries, which have recently reached the <rs>South</rs> by running the gauntlet of our cruisers, but which will soon be effectually cut off, by perfecting the blockade, and by the capture of all the ports on the <rs>Southern</rs> seaboard, including <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, <placeName reg="Savannah, Hardin, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101410">Savannah</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>, so soon as our irresistible fleet of gunboats are completed and launched upon the waves, </p>

<head>Clothing and shoes for the army.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/> We cannot avoid again recurring to this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>It is the most important <num value="1">one</num> that can at present engage the attention, not only of Congress and the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, but of the whole country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>If our troops can be properly clad, properly fed, and properly clothed, we may defy the enemy to do his worst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>For the article of food we learn that ample provision has been made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>For the article of shoes we observe that Congress has passed a law to organize a corps of <num value="2000">2,000</num> shoemakers for the public service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>They are enough, if it be possible to procure leather, which we believe it is. It is here, especially, that the patriotism of the men and women of the country might come in as a powerful aid to the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>Let everybody who has a scrap of leather that can by exercising the most severe self-denial, devote it to the service of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>Let nobody who has leather part with it to any body but an agent of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>Let everybody who has no leather, but has money, contribute as much as can be spared by any possible means, to purchase leather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>Let it be bought if possible wherever it exists, even from speculators, at any price however exorbitant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>Send all the old shoes you may have and can spare, to be half-soled for the troops Rake and scrape together every scrap of leather you can possibly lay your hands on for this holy purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>If the whole people will set to work, the army can be shod and kept in shoes, and we feel assured that they will set to work in right good earnest. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/> So in the way of clothing and blankets.--Send everything you can possibly spare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>Get oznaburgs, where you have no blankets to spare, sew the pieces together, and stuff them with cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>Learn to sleep under as few blankets as possible, that you may send the overplus to the soldiers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/> Remember, men and women of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, the <orgName n="Army of Virginia" type="army">army of Virginia</orgName> is standing guard over you, your homes, and your liberties, no matter in what part of the country you may be. If once that army be forced to leave the field, from the want of clothes to keep off the piercing blasts, and cold rains, and driving snows of winter, the wave of invasion will sweep over the whole land, and bury you underneath it. And winter is rapidly approaching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>Our men cannot stand guard or march ever the frozen ground without warm clothing, socks, and shoes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>The cold will prove more terrible than the bayonets of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>They will be compelled to leave the field if they have not these comforts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>And are you not proud of that army?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>It has won for you already a name which no people ever had at the commencement of a national career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>It has fought battles and gained victories sufficient to have conferred undying lustre on any people that ever existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>It has protected you in the hour of need.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>But for its courage and devotion you would be at this moment, the subjects of the most hateful tyranny, and the most odious tyrant that the world ever beheld.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>You would be the subjects of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> nation, and of <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00115" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>Do you not owe them, then, a debt of gratitude which the labor of a long life would not be too much to extinguish? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/> But they ask of you in return only to give them the means of serving you still farther.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>They want only clothes to face the weather, and they will still be ready to light for you to the last drop of their blood as they have fought for you hitherto.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>You are not expected to do all, but to do the best you can. The Government will do the best it can, but the crisis is too serious to be left altogether to the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>It wants help.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>Come forward and lend it as you have done heretofore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>And there is no time to lose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>Come quickly &mdash; come at once &mdash; or it may be too late.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>In the high country about <placeName reg="Winchester, Winchester, Virginia" key="tgn,7017708">Winchester</placeName>, the nights are already extremely cool.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/> While we profess not to be alarmists, we at the same time do not wish to understate the serious consequences that may result from the repulse at <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>It may interfere with the operations of <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00117" reg="mostcommon:Bragg,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName>, by enabling <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00118" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> to unite with <persName n="Buell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00119" reg="mostcommon:Buell,nomatch:0"><surname>Buell</surname></persName>, and thus derange the whole plan of campaign in the <name>West</name> and <name>South</name>west.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>We say this is possible; but upon a more careful perusal of the telegram published by us yesterday, it seems to us by no means probable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>While the blow has been heavy, it does not appear to be so heavy as it appeared to us to be when we <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> read the telegram. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/> It appears that Van-<persName n="Dorn,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00120" reg="mostcommon:Dorn,nomatch:0"><surname>Dorn</surname></persName> was successful the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day, (<dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>,) and that he <measure n="9" type="captured">captured nine</measure> pieces of cannon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>On the <dateStruct value="--2"><day reg="2">second</day></dateStruct> <time>day</time>, (<dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>,) after severe fighting in the morning, he fell back upon hearing that <num value="20000">20,000</num> fresh troops were marching to gain his rear, carrying with him a part of the captured artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>On <dateStruct><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct>, after a severe battle in retreat, the enemy captured <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Maury,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00121" reg="mostcommon:Maury,nomatch:0"><surname>Maury</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>; but this capture seems to have been temporary; for we are told that Van-<persName n="Dorn,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00122" reg="mostcommon:Dorn,nomatch:0"><surname>Dorn</surname></persName> and <persName n="Villepigue,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00123" reg="mostcommon:Villepigue,nomatch:0"><surname>Villepigue</surname></persName> afterwards came up, and not only recaptured <persName n="Maury,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00124" reg="mostcommon:Maury,nomatch:0"><surname>Maury</surname></persName>'s men, but took a whole brigade of their capture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>Such is the substance of the telegram, which adds that the enemy were driven back to <placeName reg="Matamoras, Pike, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,2090619">Matamoras</placeName>, and that our army resumed its march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>The enemy, it seems, took <num value="4">four</num> pieces of cannon, and we brought off a portion of the <num value="9">nine</num> we had captured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>The enemy claims <measure n="700" type="prisoners">700 prisoners</measure>. The telegram claims that we brought off <num value="350">350</num> from <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>If we have these, and the brigade we are said to have captured, the balance is in our favor.--The telegram says that we lost <num value="5000">5,000</num> men, and the enemy many more, and that our army is safe and reorganizing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/> We do not mean to extenuate the severity of the disaster to which our arms have been subjected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>We simply wish the public to understand exactly how great it was; not to exaggerate it in their imagination, or to be deluded into the belief that it was greater than it really was. It is serious enough, under any aspect; but not nearly so serious as at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> sight it appeared, if this telegram speak the truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>We were repulsed by overwhelming numbers, after having been completely victorious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>We killed of the enemy more than he killed for us. We took more of his prisoners than he took of ours.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>We retreated to a place of safety, and the enemy in attempting to pursue us was repulsed with loss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>This, with the lights before us, we judge to be the sum total of the affair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>Since the enemy was unable to pursue us to <persName n="Ripley,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00125" reg="mostcommon:Ripley,nomatch:0"><surname>Ripley</surname></persName>, it is hardly probable that he will be able either to join <persName n="Buell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00126" reg="mostcommon:Buell,nomatch:0"><surname>Buell</surname></persName>, or make further progress in the interior of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, without being seriously impeded in his operations by the reorganized <orgName>army of <persName n="Van,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00127" reg="mostcommon:Van,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Van</surname></persName></orgName>.

<p> Our army fought on this occasion with all its accustomed valor, Even the enemy concedes this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>It yielded, at last, only to over whelming numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>All praise to them for bravery and perseverance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>Yet, this telegram <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> gives us a glimpse of light which we cannot help thinking reveals the true cause of the defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>The convulsions through which <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> has passed have rendered its people desirous of stability and order more than even liberty, whilst on the other hand the rulers have felt the liberalizing tendency of the age, and been disposed to make concessions to those whom severe afflictions have taught to meet them even more than half way. <persName n="Napoleon,,Louis,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00132" reg="default:Napoleon,Louis,,,"><foreName>Louis</foreName> <surname>Napoleon</surname></persName>, the wisest and greatest monarch of the age, has trodden beneath his feet every moulding spark of revolution in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> &mdash; a nation which has hitherto given the cue to all revolutionary movements in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>This was a candid and truthful avowal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>They now seek to rob the <rs>South</rs> of every acre it owns and parcel it out among their victorious legions.--What object more delightful to the breasts of those foreign <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> who fill its ranks and whose only idea of justice is making themselves even in property with other men by fair means or foul?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>Moreover, the war is a revolution by the <rs>North</rs> against the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Constitution, every principle of which it has overthrown, so that in the new order of things which would succeed the subjugation of the <rs>South</rs>, Red Republicanism may reasonably anticipates the establishment of a new Constitution, in consonance with its own theory, which has been already recognized in the practical operation of the war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>There are, however, several points about them which a careful observer can detect. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/> <num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>On the left hand end of the bills is a sailor standing up; and above his head is a shield on which the following words are inscribed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/><q>&#x0022;Receivable in payment of all dues except export dues,&#x0022;</q> in the genuine the lower point of this shield is about the <num value="16" type="ordinal">16th</num> part of an inch <hi rend="italics">above</hi> the sailor's hat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>If perfect, it would come down lower than the top of the hat. In the genuine the point is nearly over the centre of the sailor's head &mdash; a little to the left; in the counterfeit, the point of the shield (if it had the point) would be over the left hand side of the sailor's hat <hi rend="italics">brim,</hi> or near where the brim joins the crown of the hat. This defect in the point of the shield, and its being placed further <hi rend="italics">to the left</hi> of the sailor's head, and extending lower down, and not directly <hi rend="italics">above</hi> the head as in the genuine, is the most prominent mark of distinction. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/> The wagon wheel this time has the proper number of spokes, and they are dim and dark like the genuine &mdash; only a little more so; not light and finely executed, like the former counterfeit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/>The mule attached to the cotton press is also dim, and more indistinct than the former counterfeit, and the harness cannot be seen, but he is not quite so much <hi rend="italics">blurred</hi> as the genuine.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/> The signatures are a quick test to those who know and have the run of all of them; but only bankers, or men who handle money largely, can make this a test.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="366"/>We may say, however, that nearly all of them appear to be forgeries at once, to a practiced eye. They are cramped and bear evidence of being slowly written, in order the better to imitate the genuine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="367"/>They are in a heavier hand and blacker ink. A man skilled in such matters can see at once that they are written by an <hi rend="italics">effort,</hi> and not by a free, easy, <hi rend="italics">natural </hi> hind. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="552"/>It is an interesting exposition of the art and benefits of lithography, and is written by <num value="1">one</num> who is really an expert, and is a reliable as well as interesting account of the difficulties and final success experienced by the <rs>Government</rs> in providing a currency for the people: </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="554"/> Some days since an article appeared in your columns in regard to Confederate notes and lithography in general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="555"/>Deeming it an interesting subject to your readers, I propose to say a few words in comment upon the article.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="556"/>The writer says: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="557"/> &#x0022;Now, the question naturally arises, why did the <rs>Government</rs> presort such uncertain and dangerous means of supplying the wants of a circulating medium ! * * * It is to be regretted that the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs>, or whoever had the matter in charge, did not in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> instance procure from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> good engravers if we did not have a sufficiency at home. * * Had this been done it would have saved much trouble and individual loss.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="The writer"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="558"/> Unfortunately for the <rs>South</rs>, the shrewd <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had been permitted to monopolize all engraving and printing and our <persName n="Banks,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00291" reg="mostcommon:Banks,nomatch:0"><surname>Banks</surname></persName> not only relied upon New York and <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> for their exchanges, but actually <hi rend="italics">left their ungraced plates there.</hi> Not <num value="1">one</num> Southern Bank in <num value="50">fifty</num> has its plates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="559"/>Hereto fore nothing had opened the eyes of our people to the fact that Bank notes could not be largely procured in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>Many did not believe the <rs>North</rs> would be insane enough to wage a war of subjugation against us, and our leading men shared in that belief, and that the war would be of short duration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/>Consequently the idea was not a prominent <num value="1">one</num> that we might be in distress for want of a circulating medium.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>The <rs>Banks</rs> patriotically came forward and placed their resources at the command of our Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>All went happily until after the <rs>Manassas</rs> fight, when the dimensions of the war loomed up in gigantic proportions, and it was discovered that the <rs>Government</rs> could not rely upon the <name>Banks</name>, but must issue its own notes and bonds to the amount of hundreds of <num value="1000000">millions</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/> in such an emergency, with no large steel plate establishment in the <rs>South</rs>, the only resource was to lithograph them or print them with type.--I do not feel called on to reply to the strictures of <q>&#x0022;An Expert&#x0022;</q> on the work done, but it was, however, the best then to be had. It was the only method of sustaining our credit, by attempting to pay all our indebtedness and to provide a circulating medium.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>Since that period much has been done Material and printers have been procured from <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, though at enormous expense, and presses have been built by our own mechanics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>The art may now be said to have attained a flourishing condition, and the country will have to rely principally upon it until the end of the war, as the blockade has become so difficult to evade that it would now be almost impossible to import steel plate machinery in sufficient quantities, or to induce printers to run the hazards which they would be compelled to incur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>Individuals have accomplished mush, for the country afforded very few facilities at the inception of our troubles. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/> It is the work of time, even with all facilities, to build up such establishments as were needed Despites of the blockades that has been accomplished, and before the <date value="01-01"> 1st of January</date> a system <hi rend="italics">can</hi> be inaugurated to secure a circulation <hi rend="italics">which cannot be counterfeited,</hi> for the secret of its safety will be known to but <num value="1">one</num> person.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>There are now <num value="5">five</num> separate establishments working upon Government notes, which can furnish respectively per week <num value="900600300000">900,600,300,000</num>, <num value="200000">200,000</num>, <num value="125000">125,000</num>, <num value="125000">125,000</num> notes, or a sum total of <num value="1625000">1,625,000</num> notes of whatever denomination may be selected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/>Thus the <rs>Government</rs> could have printed <measure n="8250000dollars" type="currency">$8,250,000</measure> in <measure n="5dollars" type="currency">$5</measure> notes weekly; or <measure n="16500000dollars" type="currency">$16,500,000</measure> in <measure n="10dollars" type="currency">$10</measure>'s, or <measure n="33000000dollars" type="currency">$33,000,000</measure> in <measure n="20dollars" type="currency">$20</measure>'s, all of which can be of superior execution, <hi rend="italics">defying</hi> the ingenuity of Northern counterfeiters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>The old circulation can then be shortly withdrawn and a new <num value="1">one</num> substituted, which, from its <hi rend="italics">uniformity,</hi> will soon be familiar to everybody. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/> An erroneous idea prevails among many people that lithography is adapted only to coarse designs, and that stone engravings will produce only <dateStruct value="1000--"><year reg="1000">1000</year></dateStruct> impressions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/>Thus your writer said: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/> &#x0022;Lithographic engraving, as applied to the fine arts, is a misnomer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>There is no engraving about it. The word lithography means the art of drawing on stone. * * * This style of engraving is not adapted to works or subjects of small size, requiring a high style of art. * * * The stones from which lithographic pictures are taken cannot be duplicated perfectly. * * * In comparing half a dozen genuine <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">$100</measure> bills of Hoyer &#x0026; Ludvig's engraving, a marked difference may be seen.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="The writer"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="576"/> The writer could not have seen the interior of a <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-class establishment, or he would probably not have thus written.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="577"/>I send you specimens of work done on stone, not <hi rend="italics">drawn,</hi> but <hi rend="italics">engraved,</hi> to show you that there is <q>&#x0022;engraving about it.&#x0022;</q> To such a pitch of perfection have the <rs>French</rs> lithographers brought this art, that it would require thorough experts to detect their finest lithograph from steel engravings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>The <q>&#x0022;marked difference&#x0022;</q> between the <q> &#x0022;genuine&#x0022;</q> notes alluded to, may result from what is termed <q> &#x0022;patchwork.&#x0022;</q> Instead of printing from <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num></hi> original engraving, very often transfers are made upon stone from several separate designs and the pieces are <q>&#x0022;patched&#x0022;</q> together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>In this piecing and patching process uniformity cannot be gained, and consequently dissimilarity in the notes would occur from inability to execute the plates all alike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>From a properly prepared engraving there can be produced <hi rend="italics">fac similes</hi> without limit, numbering <num value="1000">thousands</num> of <num value="1000000">millions</num>. --They should always be taken from <hi rend="italics"><num value="1">one</num></hi> engraving, and not several pieces Then, even if badly engraved, they will not be subject to this criticism, but in their <q>&#x0022;native ugliness&#x0022;</q> will all shine alike.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>But we have advanced, and lithography in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> <hi rend="italics">is</hi> <q>&#x0022;adapted to works of small size, requiring a high style of art.&#x0022;</q>--As the evidence thereof, conclusive and irrefutable, I refer you to the specimen which I send you, and that specimen <hi rend="italics">has been.</hi> <q>&#x0022;duplicated perfectly&#x0022;</q> to the number of many hundreds of <num value="1000">thousands</num>--Lithography is <num value="1">one</num> of the most exquisite productions of science.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/>When you have once seen its application in <hi rend="italics">perfection</hi> you exclaim <q>&#x0022;how beautiful, and yet how simple!&#x0022;</q> The stone used is calcareous milestone, hard and yet porous, and found early in <placeName key="tgn,7003669" n="1.000 15" reg="bayern">Bavaria</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>An <hi rend="italics">original</hi> engraving is made either upon steel, copper, or stone, or the drawing can be made on the stone with a pen or a crayon pencil.--Paper prepared for the purpose is placed upon the original engraving, (either steel, copper, or stone,) and an impression taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="584"/>The stone which is to be printed from is polished smooth until the surface is like a mirror.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="585"/>Then the impressions from the prepared paper are laid upon the smooth surface, and an immense pressure put upon it, forcing the ink into the pores of the stone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/>The paper is taken off entirely bold of ink and by the use of acid the ink is <hi rend="italics">set</hi> into the stones. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="587"/> The stone being kept moist with a sponge, will only take ink where the acid has <hi rend="italics">set</hi> the impression, and is then transferred to the bank note paper put upon it. The plate thus prepared, if <hi rend="italics">carefully</hi> worked, will give over <num value="100000">100,000</num> notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="588"/>At the rate which we have been compelled to work the average is about <num value="30000">30,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="589"/>The Government now has between <num value="60">sixty</num> and <num value="70">seventy</num> printers employed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>To meet its wants fully and effectually, to print in <num value="2">two</num> colors, would require the services of double that number, who will probably be on and by the <date value="01-01">1st of January.</date> The Lincoln Government, which has old-established steel plate concerns at its command, keeps in constant employment nearly <num value="400">four hundred</num> printers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>Though better than lithographs, the process is much slower, and therefore our Government is compelled to rely almost entirely upon the latter. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="592"/> In <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="Scotland" key="tgn,7002444">Scotland</placeName> the banks rely almost exclusively upon lithographs, excepting the <orgName n="Bank of England" type="bank">Bank of England</orgName>, of course, which manufactures its own paper, which is its safeguard, not the plain engraving which is used.

<head>A rabbit in a battle &mdash; an incident of the battle field of <placeName reg="Maivern Hill">Maivern Hill</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="637"/> Says an Eastern correspondent: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="638"/> A full grown rabbit had hid itself away in the copes of a fence, which separated <num value="2">two</num> fields near the centre, and a most exposed portion of the battle ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="639"/>Rabbits are wont to spend the day almost noiselessly, and in seeming dreamy meditation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="640"/>This <num value="1">one</num> could have had but little thought &mdash; if rabbits think &mdash; when choosing its place of retreat at early dawn, that, ere it was eventide, there would be such an unwonted and ruthless disturbance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="641"/> During all the preparations for battle made around its lair during the forenoon, it nevertheless remained quiet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>Early, however, in the afternoon, when the rage of battle had fairly begun, and shot and shell were falling thick and fast in all directions, a shell chanced to burst so near <persName n="Rabbit,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00308" reg="mostcommon:Rabbit,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Rabbit</surname></persName>'s hiding place that he evidently considered it unsafe to tarry longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="643"/>So, frightened almost to death, out he springs into the open field and ran hither and thither with the vain hope of finding a safe retreat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/>Whichever way it ran cannons were thundering out their smoke and fire, regiments of men were advancing or changing position, horses galloping here and there, shells bursting, and solid shot tearing up the ground. --Sometimes it would squat down and lie perfectly still, when some new and sudden danger would again start it into motion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>Once more it would stop and raise itself as high as possible on its hind legs and look all round for some place of possible retreat. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/> At length a part of the field seemed open, which was in the direction opposite from where the battle raged most fiercely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/>Thither it accordingly ran with all its remaining speed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>Unobserved by it, however, a regiment was in that direction, held in reserve; and, like <persName n="Wellington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00309" reg="mostcommon:Wellington,nomatch:0"><surname>Wellington</surname></persName>'s at <placeName reg="Waterloo, Fauquier, Virginia" key="tgn,2753461">Waterloo</placeName>, was lying flat on the ground, in order to escape the flying bullets.--Ere the rabbit seemed aware, it had jumped into the midst of the men. It could go no further, but presently nestled down beside a soldier and tried to hide itself under his arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>As the man spread the skirt of his coat over the trembling fugitive, in order to insure it all the protection in his power to bestow, he, no doubt, feelingly remembered how much he himself then needed some higher protection, under the shadow of whose arm might be hidden his own defenceless head from the fast multiplying missiles of death scattered in all directions. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/> It was not long, however, before the regiment was ordered up and forward.
