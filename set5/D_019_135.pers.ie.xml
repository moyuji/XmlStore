<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/> On <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> P. M., as my telegram the next morning apprised you, the enemy engaged us for a short time and then withdrew.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>The <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> papers state that <num value="1">one</num> of them had a <orgName type="mil" key="MARegiment">Massachusetts Regiment</orgName> on board for the purpose of landing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/><num value="1">One</num> of the steamers was crowded with men. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>The largest steamer very much resembled the <rs>Crusader</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>As they kept at long shot, mostly beyond our range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>I economized ammunition, and only fired <num value="56">fifty-six</num> times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>Upon our part no <num value="1">one</num> was injured; but lookers-on from the hills and opposite shore state that the enemy was repeatedly struck. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/> Yesterday, the steamers which had laid off during the night were reinforced by the <rs n="Pawnee" type="nativeamerican">Pawnee</rs>, and at <time value="11:30am">11:30 A.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/> Our sand-banks not being en barbette, we could only fire as the enemy came within range through the embrasures.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>This, added to the long distance at which he kept, and the necessity of occasionally repairing damages to the breastwork, combined with my desire to save ammunition, constrained me to with hold fire, except when something like a fair shot presented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>The houses in the rear were very much knocked about, and the railroad track torn up in <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> places; but, thanks to a kind <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, who seems to smile benignly on our cause, no <num value="1">one</num> with us was injured. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/> The <orgName n="New York Journal of commerce" type="newspaper">New York Journal of Commerce</orgName> is engaged in <q>&#x0022;counting the cost&#x0022;</q> of the war per year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>It assumes that there will be, while the war lasts, in the pay of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> over and above its regular army and navy establishments, no less than <num value="215000">215,000</num> soldiers and <num value="18000">18,000</num> sailors.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>With these data as a basis of calculation, it figures out the proximate yearly cost of the campaign as follows: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/> The annual pay of an infantry regiment of <num value="780">780</num> men, from the colonel down to the drummer boys, including officers' rations, which are commuted for in money, is over <measure n="148000dollars" type="currency">$148,000</measure>; at which, in round numbers, we will estimate it. In the dragoon service, to which a portion of the increased regular army will be assigned, the private's pay is <measure n="1dollars" type="currency">$1</measure> a month more than in the infantry; out of that small difference we will make no counts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>Multiplying the number of regiments in the increased army (<num value="275">275</num>) by the annual pay of <num value="1">one</num>, and we find, for salaries alone, the item of <measure n="40700000dollars" type="currency">$40,700,000</measure> a year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>The annual pay of <num value="18000">18,000</num> seamen, at <measure n="12dollars" type="currency">$12</measure> a month, is <measure n="2592000dollars" type="currency">$2,592,000</measure> --making the total for both branches of the increased service <measure n="43292000dollars" type="currency">$43,292,000</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/> Volunteers having been placed on the same footing, as to clothing, as the regular army, we learn from the table of articles and standard prices published in this paper several days ago, that each infantry private is entitled to about <measure n="32dollars" type="currency">$32</measure> worth of clothing yearly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>The cost for the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year alone is much higher than that; but we proceed upon the supposition that the soldiers are to be under pay at least <q>&#x0022;<measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>&#x0022;</q>--the minimum term fixed by the <rs>President</rs> in his <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> levy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>Leaving out the officers, who purchase their own uniforms, we find that the yearly cost of clothing our soldiers in this war will be <measure n="6160000dollars" type="currency">$6,160,000</measure>. For guns, knapsacks, and armament complete, a moderate estimate would be <measure n="20dollars" type="currency">$20</measure> a man for the war, making a total outlay on those accounts of <measure n="3850000dollars" type="currency">$3,850,000</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/> The lowest average cost of rations for our army and navy, during the war, will be <measure n="20cents" type="currency">20 cents</measure> day. Circumstances may make it far above that; but even at that low figure, the yearly board of extra soldiers and sailors will be <measure n="15730000dollars" type="currency">$15,730,000</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/>They soon came upon the rascals, who abandoned their plunder and fled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/>Upon receiving this information, he sent back for another howitzer, and a further reinforcement of infantry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/>The curses of this man upon his <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> comrades, for their cowardice, were loud and deep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>The skirmish happened just at the bridge over <placeName reg="Back River, Hampton, Virginia" key="tgn,2142203">Back River</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>It had been broken down, and the fugitives had to cross upon planks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1087"/> This bold excursion, under the very guns of the enemy, determined the authorities at <placeName reg="Old Point, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2557597">Old Point</placeName> to put a stop to it and clear us out from <placeName reg="Bethel, Oxford, Maine" key="tgn,2044460">Bethel</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1088"/>This determination was conveyed to us by persons who came from the neighborhood of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1090"/>We then retired, <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> and after reaching camp the guns were placed in battery, and the infantry took their places behind their breastwork.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1093"/>The moment the head of the column advanced far enough to show <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> companies, the <name>Parrot</name> gun of the <orgName n="Howitzer Battery" type="battery">Howitzer Battery</orgName> opened on them, throwing a shell right into their midst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1094"/>Their ranks broke in confusion, and the column, or as much of it as we could see, retreated behind <num value="2">two</num> small farm houses.--From their position a fire was opened on us, which was replied to by our battery, which commanded the route of their approach.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1095"/>Our firing was excellent, and the shells scattered in all directions when they burst.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1096"/>They could hardly approach the guns which they were firing for the shells which came from our battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1098"/>Remarkable to say, not <num value="1">one</num> of our men was killed inside of our encampment.--Several horses were slain by the shells and bullets. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1099"/> Finding that bombardment would not answer, the enemy, about <time value="11oclock">11 o'clock</time>, tried to carry the position by assault, but met a terrible repulse at the hands of the infantry as he tried to scale the breastworks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1100"/>The men disregarded sometimes the defences erected for them, and, leaping on the embankment, stood and fired at the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, cutting them down as they came up. <num value="1">One</num> company of the <orgName type="regiment" key="NY7">New York Seventh Regiment</orgName>, under <persName n="Wardrop,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00427" reg="mostcommon:Wardrop,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Wardrop</surname></persName>, or <persName n="Winthrop,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00428" reg="mostcommon:Winthrop,nomatch:0"><surname>Winthrop</surname></persName>, attempted to take the redoubt on the left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1101"/>The marsh they crossed was strewn with their bodies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1102"/>Their <rs type="role2">Captain</rs>, a fine looking man, reached the fence, and, leaping on a log, waved his sword, crying, <q>&#x0022;Come on, boys, <num value="1">one</num> charge and the day is ours,&#x0022;</q> The words were his last, for a Carolina rifle ended his life the next moment, and his men fled in terror back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1105"/>As <num value="1">one</num> regiment would give up the effort, another would be marched to the position, but with no better success, for a shell would scatter them like chaff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1106"/>The men did not seem able to stand fire at all. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1107"/> About <time value="1oclock">one o'clock</time> their guns were silenced, and a few moments after their infantry retreated precipitately down the road to <placeName reg="Hampton, Hampton, Virginia" key="tgn,7013687">Hampton</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1108"/> Our Cavalry, numbering <num value="3">three</num> companies, went in pursuit, and harassed them down to the edge of <placeName reg="Hampton, Hampton, Virginia" key="tgn,7013687">Hampton</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1109"/>As they retreated many of the wounded fell along the road and died, and the whole road to <placeName reg="Hampton, Hampton, Virginia" key="tgn,7013687">Hampton</placeName> was strewn with haversacks, overcoats, canteens, muskets, &#x0026;c, which the men had thrown off in their retreat. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1110"/> After the battle, I visited the position they held.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1111"/>The houses behind which they had been hid had been burst by our troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1112"/>Around the yard were the dead bodies of the men who had been killed by our cannon, mangled in the most frightful manner by the shells.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1113"/>The uniforms on the bodies were very differents and many of them are like those of the <rs>Virginia</rs> soldiery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1114"/>A little farther on we came to the point to which they had carried some of their wounded, who had since died.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1115"/>The gay looking uniforms of the <orgName type="mil" key="NYZouaveVolunteer">New York Zouaves</orgName> contrasted greatly with the paled, fixed faces of their dead owners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1116"/>Going to the swamp through which they attempted to pass to assault our lines, presented another bloody scene.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1117"/>Bodies dotted the black morass from <num value="1">one</num> end to the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1118"/>I saw <num value="1">one</num> boyish, delicate-looking fellow lying on the mud, with a bullet hole through his breast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1119"/>His hand was pressed on the wound from which his life blood had poured, and the other was clenched in the grass that grew near him. Lying on the ground was a Testament which had fallen from his pocket, dabbled with blood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1120"/>On opening the cover I found the printed inscription, <q>&#x0022;Presented to the <name>Defenders</name> of their Country, by the New York <orgName n="Bible Society" type="society">Bible Society</orgName>.&#x0022;</q> An U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1121"/> Among the haversacks picked up along the route were many letters from the <rs>Northern States</rs>, asking if they liked the <rs>Southern</rs> farms, and if the <rs>Southern</rs> barbarians had been whipped out yet. </p>
