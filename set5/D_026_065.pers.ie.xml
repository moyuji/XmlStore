<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>It is known here that at that time a movement in the <orgName n="House of Commons" type="government">House of Commons</orgName> demanding a recognition of the insurgents by <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> Government was set down for the <date value="06-30">30th of June,</date> and that you were not altogether without apprehension that the movement, aided by a moral effect of the verdict in the case of the <rs>Alexandra</rs>, and backed by a supposed patronage in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, might prevail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>Thirdly, that movement was to be based upon the ground of the demonstrated failure of the armies of the <rs>Union</rs>; but while it was going on, those armies have achieved victories which here are regarded as warranting an expectation of a complete and rapid extinguishment of the insurrection.

<item n="2"> Secondly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>This Government is satisfied that the law officers of the crown have performed their duties in regard to the case of the <rs>Alexandra</rs> with a sincere conviction of the adequacy of the law of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> and a sincere desire to give it effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/></item> 
<item n="3"> Thirdly. The Government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> does not descend to inquire whether the jury in the case were or were not impartial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>It willingly believes they were so, and it accepts the statement made with so much unanimity by all the reporters of the case, that the judge who presided at the trial made the bench responsible for the verdict by the boldness and directness of his rulings against the prosecution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/></item> 
<item n="4"> Fourthly. <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> being a free and constitutional country, and the proceedings in the case of the <rs>Alexandra</rs> having been thus far conducted by the <rs>Government</rs> in good faith and according to law, the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> would not be justified in deeming the verdict rendered by the jury a cause of national complaint, provided that the <rs>Government</rs> prosecute an appeal to the higher courts until it be determined in the court of last resort whether the law is adequate to the maintenance of the neutrality which <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty</name> has proclaimed, and provided also that in the meantime the <rs>Alexandra</rs> and other vessels which may be found violating or preparing to violate the law be prevented, so far as the law may allow, from leaving <name>British</name> ports to prosecute their work of devastation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/></item> </list> 
<p> <placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> is not prepared to believe that the judiciary of Great retain will, with well-considered judgment, render nugatory and void a statute of the realm which, with its counterpart in our own legislation, has hitherto been regarded by both nations as a guaranty of that mutual forbearance which is so essential to the preservation of peace and friendship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>Nor shall I incur the hazard of producing irritation on either side of the ocean by criticising the reasoning by which the learned judge who tried the case of the <rs>Alexandra</rs> justified his conclusions thereon, or by which that portion of the <rs>British</rs> press which approves the verdict labors to defend it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/> It would be very gratifying to me if I were allowed to rest here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>But the position in which the case of the <rs>Alexandra</rs> is left by the recent trial renders it necessary to contemplate a possible a formation of the rulings of the <rs type="role" reg="Chief-Baron">Chief Baron</rs> in the court of <sic>der</sic> resort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>You are entitled to know and it seems proper that you should be able to communicate to <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> Government the views which the <rs>President</rs> has taken of the rights and duties of this Government in that unlooked for and deeply to be deprecated event.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>I trust that I shall be able to express those convictions calmly and dispassionately without wounding the just self-respect of <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>If the rulings of the <rs type="role" reg="chief-Baron">chief Baron</rs> of the <name>Exchequer</name> in the case of the <rs>Alexandra</rs> shall be affirmed so as to regulate the action of <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> Government, the <rs>President</rs> will, as he thinks, be left to understand that there is no law in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> which will be effective to preserve mutual relations of forbearance between the subjects of <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty</name> and the <rs>Government</rs> and people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> in the only point where they are exposed to infraction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>The fitting out of the <rs>Alabama</rs> and the <rs>Florida</rs>, as well as of the <rs>Alexandra</rs>, will thus receive the sanction of the <rs>Government</rs>, and the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> will be without any guaranty whatever against the indiscriminate and unlimited employment of capital, industry, and skill by <name>British</name> subjects, in building, arming, equipping, and sending forth ships-of war from <name>British</name> ports to make war against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/> I may safely protect, in behalf of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, against the assumption of that position by the <rs>British</rs> nation, because this Government, with a statute exactly similar to that of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, does constantly hold itself able and bound to prevent such injuries to <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> thinks it not improper to suggest for the consideration of <name n="her Majesty" type="role">her Majesty's</name> Government the question whether on appeal to be made by them, Parliament might not think it just and expedient to amend the existing statute in such a way as to effect what the <num value="2">two</num> Governments actually believe it ought now to accomplish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>Its unavoidable calamities have been greatly augmented by the refusal of the enemy to respect the laws of civilized warfare, and by their fiendish attempt to wrest submission from us by visiting the most relentless barbarities upon women and children, the aged and the helpless.

Born to an inheritance of freedom, you cannot hesitate to choose between slavery or death, Submission to an enemy who has exhausted every infamy is not endurable even in thought; but were we base enough to desire peace upon any terms less than the unqualified recognition of our independence, self-interest alone would teach us the folly of relying upon the forbearance of a nation, who have shown in every step of the war that their faith is perfidy, and their only pulley is rapine, plunder and oppression.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>The whole history of our former association with the <rs>Northern States</rs> admonishes us that in a common Government they will never fail to employ their power to take away our property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>Their present malice springs <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> chiefly from baffled cupidity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/> Such is the doom denounced for the people of the <rs>South</rs> by the wicked race now warring upon us. But we know it can never be executed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>In all the <name>States</name> we find the resolution to endure every extremity rather than submit, and with this spirit our people are invincible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>The armies are filling up their ranks, and the legislation of Congress has added still further to their numbers and efficiency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>Those citizens who remain at home to carry on the industrial pursuits essential to the support of the army will see to it that you shall not want for food while you are exposing your lives to protect their property and homes from rapine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>The defence of the country has become its business, and every citizen is required to contribute to it in his proper sphere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/> The war is no longer popular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>The rich are allowed to buy an exemption, and thus cast all the burden and risk upon the poor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>The laboring classes have already revolted against the draft. --To escape its odium, enormous bounties have been offered to volunteers; but all these expedients have failed, and again a heavy draft has been ordered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>The armies of the enemy are every day diminishing, and it is evident they cannot recruit them to the numbers with which they began the struggle.
