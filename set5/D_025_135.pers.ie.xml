<milestone unit="sentence" n="343"/>This is the best of them all. In point of matter, and manner, it is worthy to take place by the side of any State paper that has appeared during the last <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> in any quarter of the globe.--The style is smooth and polished, yet terse and vigorous; the tone calm and philosophical, yet firm and energetic; the <rs>English</rs> unexceptionable, and the temper excellent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>The clear and distinct view which it presents of the whole field which it embraces, cannot fall to make an impression wherever it may be read. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/> Our foreign relations are handled by the <rs>President</rs> in a masterly manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>He tears off the vell of centrality &mdash; flimsy enough in all conscience &mdash; with which <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> endeavors to conceal her hostility to the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and exposes to the whole world her mean subserviency to <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00236" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> and his emissary in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>As long ago as <date value="1861-05">May, 1861,</date> the <rs>British Government</rs> took care to inform the latter that the position of his country was &#x0022;Intermediate,&#x0022; and that its sympathies were rather with the <rs>North</rs> than with the <rs>South</rs>.&#x0022; This of itself was a violation of that &#x0022;strict neutrality&#x0022; to which such hypocritical pretensions are made, if Vattel be acknowledged of any authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>But this was merely the beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>In <date value="1861-06">June, 1861,</date> the same Government interdicted the use of its ports to the armed ships and privateers of both the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> and the &#x0022;so-called&#x0022; <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, with their prizes.-- <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00237" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName> observed to <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Lyons</foreName></persName> that this prohibition, and a similar <num value="1">one</num> of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, would be the death- blow of Southern privateering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>Shortly after, <persName n="Adams,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00238" reg="mostcommon:Adams,nomatch:0"><surname>Adams</surname></persName> bullied <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName> for admitting <persName n="Ma,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00239" reg="mostcommon:Ma,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Ma</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="352"/>con to an audience, and <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Russell</foreName></persName>, like the cringing our that he is, apologized, and promised to behave better in future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>In <date value="1861-04">April, 1861,</date> <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00240" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> declared the whole coast of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, from the <rs>Potomac</rs>, in a state of blockade, although, according to his own reports to Congress, the whole navy of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> consisted at the time of but <num value="24">twenty-four</num> vessels, of which <num value="0.5">one-half</num> were absent on foreign stations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/>The coast thus declared in a state of blockade is between <num value="3">three</num> and <measure n="4000miles" type="distance">four thousand miles</measure> in extent, and could not be effectually blockaded by the combined navies of the whole civilized world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>By the treaty of <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> no blockade was to be respected which was not effectual.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>Yet <persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00241" reg="nearbymention:Russell,Thomas,,,"><surname>Russell</surname></persName> not only respected this blockade, but pointed out to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> Minister the manner in which it might be made effectual.--Nay, <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Lyons</foreName></persName> actually laid before his Government <persName n="Seward,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00242" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><surname>Seward</surname></persName>'s apology for endeavoring to destroy the harbor of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, which was that the naval force of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> was small, and the coast to be blockaded <measure n="3000miles" type="distance">three thousand miles</measure> in extent &mdash; a palpable acknowledgment that the blockade was a failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/><persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00243" reg="nearbymention:Russell,Thomas,,,"><surname>Russell</surname></persName> himself claimed credit for having assisted the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to keep up this paper blockade, although it inflicted enormous injury on <name>British</name> trade.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/>He afterwards stated that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> were not in a condition to insist upon other nations acknowledging that the blockade was effectual.--Notwithstanding this positive declaration, when <persName n="Mason,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00244" reg="mostcommon:Mason,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Mason</surname></persName> called on <persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00245" reg="nearbymention:Russell,Thomas,,,"><surname>Russell</surname></persName> to request the <rs>British Government</rs> to withhold its sanction from this gross violation of public law, <persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00246" reg="nearbymention:Russell,Thomas,,,"><surname>Russell</surname></persName> replied that, though the blockade had not been effective some time since, it <hi rend="italics">was</hi> at that particular moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>He had a new interpretation, also, ready for the clause in the declaration of <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00247" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName>, which says that no blockade shall be considered effective unless &#x0022;sufficient to prevent access to the coast.&#x0022; &#x0022;That clause,&#x0022; he said, &#x0022;was directed against blockades not sustained by any actual force, or by a notoriously inadequate force, such as the occasional appearance of a man-of-war in the offing, or the like.&#x0022; This construction makes the declaration mean the reverse of what it said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="360"/>The annunciation of it is quite sufficient to prove that the <rs>English Government</rs> did not mean to be bound by it. There can be no doubt of the motive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="361"/>Hostility to us made <persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00248" reg="nearbymention:Russell,Thomas,,,"><surname>Russell</surname></persName> violate international law and his agreement with us. When we complained that all this was contrary to the declaration of <persName n="Paris,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00249" reg="mostcommon:Paris,nomatch:0"><surname>Paris</surname></persName>, and that he was injuring us by giving a respect to that blockade to which it was not entitled, he said it was quite true &mdash; and in his late speech, alluded to by us a short time ago, he states his reasons for doing so. The <rs>English</rs>, it seems, once blockaded a coast of <measure n="2000miles" type="distance">2,000 miles</measure>, and they had no right to reprehend the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> for doing the same thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/>Now, that very blockade of which <persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00250" reg="nearbymention:Russell,Thomas,,,"><surname>Russell</surname></persName> here speaks, has been acknowledged by <name>English</name> writers on public law, as well as <name>English</name> historians, to have been altogether against law, while all foreigners, without exception, denounce it as the most infamous outrage ever perpetrated upon the rights of neutral nations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="363"/> Such is an outline of the masterly argument, supported by undoubted facts, by which the <rs>President</rs> proves that <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> has been our deadly enemy throughout this war. <persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00251" reg="nearbymention:Russell,Thomas,,,"><surname>Russell</surname></persName> himself shows <num value="1">one</num> of his motives when he deprecated war with the <rs>Federal States</rs> in conjunction with these slaveholding States.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="364"/>In the affair of the iron steamers, detained by <persName n="Russell,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00252" reg="nearbymention:Russell,Thomas,,,"><surname>Russell</surname></persName> contrary to all law, public or municipal, he is quite as clear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="365"/>Indeed, we are well convinced that were there any means of coming in contact with <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>, we should be bound to declare war. </p> </div3> </div2>
