<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>We went ahead at a double-quick, dashing through the <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs> nearly waist deep, and it caused an involuntary shudder as the chilling element filled our boots and saturated our clothing, so that we moved forward with difficulty, charging we knew not where, and anticipating a shower of bullets from some direction every moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>We were halted in the road, and a consultation was held, the result of which was that we were ordered back across the <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/> We had a scene on the parade-ground the other evening, during battalion drill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>The regiment was standing at open order and ordered arms, when <persName n="Marks,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00139" reg="mostcommon:Marks,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Marks</surname></persName> gave the order stack arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>Your military readers will a once see what a blunder this was, and how impossible it was to execute such an order according to modern tactics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>It threw the line into confusion; some companies stood fast without obeying the order, and others in at awkward and bungling manner, shouldered arms without order; the rear rank marched forward without order, and then the stacks were made without order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>Among the companies that didn't obey the order was the <rs>Continental Guards</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>Seeing this, the <rs>Colonel</rs> shouted to <persName n="Fleming,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00140" reg="mostcommon:Fleming,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Fleming</surname></persName>, wanting to known why his company didn't stack arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>The <rs>Colonel</rs> said he would teach him how. The <rs>Captain</rs> replied than that was just what he wanted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>The <rs>Colonel</rs> instead of teaching him how to execute the movement, indignantly ordered him to marvel his company off the ground, and report him self under arrest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>The remaining companies then finished the bungles of stacking arms from an open order. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>The <rs>Colonel</rs> informed the company that he did not order them off the parade fore him to punish them; he merely wished to let them understand distinctly that in battalion drill he alone was their commander, and that when he gave the order, right of wrong, it must be obeyed, if possible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/> <persName n="Peyton,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00143" reg="mostcommon:Peyton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieut.</roleName> <surname>Peyton</surname></persName>, who had drilled the company, stepped up to speak in extenuation of the company, and to take the blame upon himself, he having always instructed the men never to obey a wrong order, but the <rs>Colonel</rs> refused to listen to him. The <rs>Lieutenant</rs> then offered him his sword; this the <rs>Colonel</rs> also refused, saying he had just as good a sword of his own.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>The object of this policy, according to the same authority, is to afford a greater number of troops for operations upon other holds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>In the first place, the lower Potomac being blockaded, and the <rs type="place">Chesapeake and Ohio Canal</rs> being subject to freeing over for the greater part of the winter, it becomes absolutely necessary to the abstinence of the army and population in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> that the <orgName n="Baltimore and Ohio Railroad" type="railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</orgName> should be opened as far West as Its junctions with the railroads running up into <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>As the possession and refitting of this part of the road would carry them back so far into <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Northwest</rs> Virginia</placeName> as to reach the portion of that region already in their hand it is no doubt their purpose to send a sufficient force in that direction from <orgName n="column"><persName n="Banks,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00159" reg="mostcommon:Banks,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Banks</surname></persName>' column</orgName> or some other, to hold the whole <unclear></unclear> of the <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName> road to <placeName key="tgn,7014620" n="1.000 73" reg="wheeling, ohio, west virginia">Wheeling</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>There is really no root for speculation on the subject; and we may as confidently expect to hear of strong columns troops being sent into the country along the line of that road, as we may expect any certain future event, such as the meeting of Congress, or the setting in of winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>Half the large force they now have on the <rs>Potomac</rs> would be sufficient for the defence of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> against any aggressive movement of our army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>The rest of the surplus portion of their vast <unclear>ho</unclear> can be sent off to different fields of service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>A portion of it has been put upon transports a Annapolis, and sent out upon the grand have expedition against our Southern coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>A portion of it has been sent to that portion <unclear>o</unclear> <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> lying opposite our batteries on the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>Another portion has been sent, or preparing to be sent, along the <orgName n="Baltimore and Ohio Railroad" type="railroad">Baltimore and Ohio Railroad</orgName>, with a view to restoring the track and the bridges, and putting that highway again in running order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>This last measure will require the strengthening of <persName n="Reynolds,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00161" reg="mostcommon:Reynolds,nomatch:0"><surname>Reynolds</surname></persName> an Rosencranz, and probably reinforcements will be sent to those <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/> The campaign in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> is also so popular with the <rs>North</rs>, especially with the <rs>Northwest</rs>, that doubtless whatever remaining force may be spared from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, in consequence of assuming the defensive in the quarter, will be sent to <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/> Another fortnight will fully determine whether this really be his winter programme or not; for unless he attacks us before <placeName reg="Centreville, Queen Annes, Maryland" key="tgn,2046543">Centreville</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> during the next fortnight it is reasonable to suppose he will not do <unclear>s</unclear> at all before the next season.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>The object of an attack there would, of course, only be for an advance into our territory as far as <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> at least; and the weather and condition of the roads will be such very-soon as to prevent the accomplishment of that result of; successful battle.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/> It can hardly admit of doubt that this would be a wise programme on the part of the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>It would give the <rs>South</rs> a mach more troublesome winter's batch of work than if he concentrated his whole force before <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName> with a view to an advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>All this needful work will tax <persName n="Benjamin,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00167" reg="mostcommon:Benjamin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Benjamin</surname></persName>'s rare activity <unclear></unclear> the highest point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/>The mere item of fuel would, it that case, tax his other means of conveyance to their highest capacity; and we should have him starving and shivering, if not freezing in his capital, during the whole winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>In this point of view, the view, the <rs type="place">valley of the Shenandoah</rs> becomes our most important field of operations, and we are glad to hear that it will probably be committed to the charge of the indomitable General of the <rs>Stone Wall Brigade</rs>. </p> </div3>

<head>Disembarkation ordered &mdash; fear of an attack from the <rs>Confederates</rs>.</head>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/> The officers and men were in the midst of their rejoicing at the prospect of speedy relief from the state of tedious inaction which always exists on board a crowded ship, when <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00400" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> unexpectedly dampened their gladness by an order directing the disembarkation of the entire force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>This order, cinched in terse military terms, requiring the men to land in the line of battle, with ammunition and complete equipments, afforded great latitude for conjecture as to its object, and all manner of ridiculous surmises were current. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/> The <num value="1">one</num> most generally received was, that a demonstration would be made upon <placeName reg="Sewell's Point, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,2653764">Sewell's Point</placeName>, where a saucy battery belonging to the rebels is erected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/>The minds of many were prepared to accept this solution of the vexed question, because it had not been altogether unanticipated that the <term type="ship">iron-clad</term> <rs type="ship">Merrimac</rs> might at any moment round the sandy promontory and escape to sea. The battery at the <rs type="place">Point</rs> commands the channel, and with these guns in possession of our forces the chances of running the blockade in that direction would be materially lessened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/>I have heard grave fears expressed for the safety of the fleet as it lies at anchor here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>Should the rebels be desperate enough for the undertaking, there is no doubt that a vessel such as the <rs>Merrimac</rs> is said to be could do immense injury to these unprotected transports.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>What could prevent her coming down some moonlight night and pouring a few broadsides of shells into our midst?
