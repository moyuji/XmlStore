<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>What we have done is scarcely a type of what we can do. The present situation, far from being desperate, is only trying enough to induce new energy in the contest, to call for new exertions and new sacrifices, to remind our people of the nature of the conflict, and the object of the enemy, to bring out our whole strength, and to let the world see of what we are capable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>On the contrary, we speak the solemn truth when we declare that in our opinion our situation although it is <num value="1">one</num> which calls for the utmost exertion, so far from being desperate is not even gloomy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The enemy has taken <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName> and <placeName reg="Port Hudson, East Baton Rouge, Louisiana" key="tgn,7017544">Port Hudson</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Not at all, as we showed the other day, and we think showed satisfactorily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>On the other hand, he weakens himself, by the garrisons he is obliged to put in those places, and he strengthens our armies by returning the garrisons which have been so long shut up there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Having no longer any detached ports to defend, our army could then complete the policy of concentration which, but partially pursued, has already been attended with such memorable results.--Retiring to the interior as he advances, we shall weaken him and strengthen ourselves with every step that he takes in leaving his base of operations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>We have made our calculations long ago that all the towns within reach of the enemy's navy would fall, and giving them, for the sake of argument, up to him, we conceive that we are more able to beat him without them than with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Let it not be forgotten, in the meantime, that we have a powerful army &mdash; an army that has never been beaten &mdash; with a General at its head who may rank with the most renowned leaders of whom history makes mention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Let the despondent think on these facts and tell us what there is gloomy in our situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>For our part, we see nothing whatever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>We may be called on to destroy more cotton and tobacco, to prevent their falling into the hands of the enemy; but, in our opinion, this would not be the worst thing the <rs>Government</rs> could do, even of its own free will.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/><placeName key="tgn,7008813" n="1.000 1" reg="zaragoza,zaragoza,aragon,espana,europe">Saragossa</placeName> was the reverse of all this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>Her houses were built of huge blocks of solid stone, and were, each of itself, a fortress capable of withstanding the fire of a <num value="12">twelve</num> pounder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The roofs were flat, the windows all walled up, and the walls all cut into port holes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The squares were so many islands of houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The streets had been undermined and cut into galleries, so that there was a communication all through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>Above, passages were cut through the walls of the houses, so as to permit a communication in that quarter, and when they came to a street they had only to descend and take the underground track.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>At each corner of the town, which was a quadrangle, stood an enormous convent, <num value="1">one</num>, at least, of which (<persName n="Engracia,,Santa,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="default:Engracia,Santa,,,"><foreName>Santa</foreName> <surname>Engracia</surname></persName>) was as strong as any castle in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The <rs>Spaniards</rs> had been making preparation for the siege for <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure>. It may well be imagined what a formidable job it was to take such a city, defended as it was by peasants roused to the extremity of fury by the exhortations of their priests, ignorant, fanatical, and believing it to be a duty to stay <rs n="Frenchman" type="propernoun">Frenchmen</rs>, even the sick <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>It was, in fact, only taken after <num value="54000">54,000</num> of the inhabitants and peasants from the adjoining country had perished by pestilence or the sword, by destroying the houses <num value="1">one</num> after another, by mining and blowing them up, until at least <num value="0.33">a <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num></num> of the city was laid in ruins. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> Now, our poor boys had no such defences as these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>They had nothing but earth works which they raised themselves, and behind these they fought with as much resolution as the <name>Saragossa</name> people until they were starved out. Besides, there were several elements of obstinate resistance wanting in their case which were used with great effect by the <name>Spaniards</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>They were all fanatics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The priests and a few popular leaders were at the bottom of the defence, and they ruled the populace with a rod of iron.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>They constructed gibbets all around the city, and hung every man who talked of surrender, or so much as hinted that he was tired of the butcherly work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>The principal of these were the bare footed friar, who charged on foot with the <rs type="document">Bible</rs> in <num value="1">one</num> hand and a drawn sword in the other, and the lemonade seller of the <name>Cosso</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>As soon as these men were killed the defence began to slacken, and the place shortly after surrendered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Now, our boys were civilized men, not fanatics.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>They fought from principle, not because they were afraid of the gallows, and they fought with cool courage, not like madmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Taken upon the whole, we do not know that they did not fully come up to the <name>Saragossans</name>, who, as well as they, yielded at last. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>We do not so look upon it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/> It is not for any Court to determine whether foreign Consuls are properly here or not. It is exclusively for the <rs>President</rs> to recognize foreign Ministers and Consuls, and when he recognizes a person as properly exercising the functions of a foreign Consul the <rs type="place">Courts</rs> are bound to recognize him as such.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>Nor is it necessary, in these cases, to inquire into the powers and duties of Consuls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>These powers are generally prescribed by laws and treaties I know of no law or treaty which authorizes a foreign Consul to exempt any person domiciled in this country from obedience to our laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>The Consul's certificate, in this case, does not pretend to do any such thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>It merely states the <hi rend="italics">belief</hi> of the <rs>Consul</rs> that the party named in it is a British subject, and as such entitled to the protection of the <rs>Queen</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>It is notice to any person to whom it is shown that the <rs>Consul</rs> considers him a British subject, and nothing more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>If the person having such a certificate is really and in fact liable, by law, to conscription, the certificate, would not of itself exempt him. But it seems to me that an enrolling officer ought to respect such a certificate so far as not to enroll the person having it without <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> making inquiries, and obtaining such information as satisfies him that the party is really a permanent resident of this country and liable to conscription. </p>
