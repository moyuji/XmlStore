<milestone unit="sentence" n="384"/> The <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> has enjoyed from the beginning great advantages over the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> in the superior abilities of its military leaders, and especially, the heroic character of its rank and file, who, we verily believe, taken as a whole, has never been equalled by any military population on the face of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have had <num value="3">three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> times our numbers, and we may not deny that by means of discipline they became good soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/>But their best <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> can not be compared with <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00261" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> and <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00262" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName>, and there is a still greater difference between their private soldiers and those of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> armless are in great part made up of mercenaries, the dregs of civilization, without any sentiment of honor or patriotism, and whose highest soldierly qualifications are their discipline and brute courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>The Confederates, on the contrary, are, in the general, men of character, of self respect, having interests in society, and who have taken up arms not for the miserable pay they receive, but from the most exalted motives of patriotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>Many of them, fighting in the ranks, are men of property, others professional and educated men, men of refinement, culture, and moral and social elevation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>It is not astonishing to us that an army composed of such materials has triumphed so often over the most tremendous odds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>Efficiently officered throughout, it would never have sustained a defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/>The world does not contain its equal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>It has never yet received half the praise it deserves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>It becomes both the <rs>Government</rs> and the people of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName> to manifest by every means in their power their profound sense of the illustrious services and unparalleled sacrifices of the private soldiers of the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/> The officers of the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>, whose highest honor it is that they command such men, should do everything in their power to promote their comfort and welfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00263" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> and some other military leaders set an example in this respect, which might be imitated with benefit by all their subordinates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>The great <rs>Napoleon</rs> was the soldiers' idol, not more on account of his transcendent genius than because he carefully studied the wants of the private soldiers, not deeming it beneath his dignity to look minutely and systematically into the manner in which all their necessities were supplied.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>He was said to be the best quartermaster in his own army, and his eagle eye was as watchfully bent over the provision for their daily wants, as over the front they showed in the hour of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>Never was extraordinary merit in the ranks unobserved or unrewarded by him. There are some subordinate officers in our army who might learn a valuable lesson from the great <rs n="Corsican" type="ethnic">Corsican</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/>Whilst enforcing discipline sternly and uniformly, they may do much to lighten the toils and alleviate the sufferings of the most herole body of men in the world, by manifesting active sympathy with their troubles, supplying as far as possible their reasonable wants, and encouraging in them that self-respect and manly pride which belong to the <rs>Southern</rs> character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>Let not our private soldiers feel that they have ceased to become men because they are soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>Let them not imagine that they are degraded to mere machines because they are fighting in the ranks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>Having given up comfortable homes and friends and kindred, let, them, feel that they still have friends in their officers, that they are not without <num value="1">one</num> soul upon the earth who cares for them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>Or, if there be officers &mdash; and we trust and believe the number of such in the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName> is small &mdash; who look upon their men as inferior beings, let them bear in mind that the surest road to military success is in the love and affection which soldiers have for those who command them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>Soldiers will fight to the death for a man they love, when they will yield but a cold and mechanical support to any other.--The love of his soldiers for the man <rs>Napoleon</rs> was as much a means of his success as his great military capacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>And let all our officers study not only the comfort and welfare of their soldiers, but husband carefully the precious resources of human life still left us.
