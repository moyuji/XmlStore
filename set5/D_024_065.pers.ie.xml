<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>From <num value="1">one</num> of the editorials, headed &#x0022;The Destiny of the <rs>West</rs>,&#x0022; we extract the following: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/> The South, endangered by this huge and devilish lunacy of &#x0022;Abolitionism,&#x0022; seceded, withdrew, and utterly refused to recognize as its <rs type="role" reg="Chief Magistrate">Chief Magistrate</rs> <num value="1">one</num> who not only did not represent the will and wishes of a single-citizen in <num value="15">fifteen</num> States, but who was pledged to carry out &#x0022;principles&#x0022; which, if he had ventured to avow them <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> ago in the streets of this or any other Northern city, would have caused his being mobbed and beaten with rotten eggs!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>But they should have submitted of course, to those pledged to use the <hi rend="italics">prestige</hi> and power of the common Government against &#x0022;slavery, &#x0022; against the peace, order, and safety of society, for the &#x0022;gradual extinction&#x0022; of the supremacy of the white citizen and in favor of the &#x0022;impartial freedom&#x0022; and consequent amalgamation with their negroes &mdash; for their children, if not themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>Yes, they should have submitted to the <hi rend="italics">form,</hi> of course, though the <hi rend="italics">spirit</hi> was utterly dead, and trusted to the ballot box (in the <rs>North</rs>,) for safety, especially as the &#x0022;friends of the <rs>South</rs>&#x0022; were in a minority in every Northern State, and there was not a single politician among them who did not assent to the fundamental principle of the <orgName n="Abolition party" type="party">Abolition party</orgName>, and thus give up the whole question at the start! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/> On the contrary, they really believed themselves the best possible judges of their own safety, &#x0022;both of the measure and of the mode of redress,&#x0022;as advised long since by <persName n="Jefferson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00036" reg="mostcommon:Jefferson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jefferson</surname></persName>, and as the prospect of having their rights defended by others, while they stood still and looked on, was to say the least, rather dubious they took their destiny in their own hands, and placed themselves, for the time being, beyond the scope of a Government thus perverted from an instrument of common be nescience into a machine of sectional ruin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Of course, we repeat, they did wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>They should have submitted, at all events, until all the departments of the <rs>Federal Government</rs>, as well as all the <name>Governments</name> of the <rs>Northern States</rs>, were in the hands of the anti <orgName n="Southern party" type="party">Southern party</orgName>, and then with the precedent of submission before them, and bound helplessly at the feet of the friends of &#x0022;impartial freedom,&#x0022; why, they might resist perhaps if they could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>But they met the <name>Abolition</name> monster at the threshold, instead of fighting for the preservation of society at the hearthstone, and though blood has been poured out like water on the soil of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> the cause of &#x0022;impartial freedom&#x0022; has thus far, miscarried in the land of <persName n="Washington,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00037" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><surname>Washington</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>If the <rs>Northern</rs> &#x0022;friends of the <rs>South</rs>&#x0022; had forced <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00038" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> to abandon the &#x0022;principles&#x0022; of his party, and to stand by the decision of the <orgName n="Supreme Court" type="org">Supreme Court</orgName>, of cause there would have been no secession nor <num value="1">one</num> drop of blood spilled in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>; and therefore it is absolutely certain that the battles on the <rs>Potomac</rs> are fought for the idea of &#x0022;impartial freedom' on <num value="1">one</num> side, and the preservation of society and the true principles of the <rs>Constitution</rs> on the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>But the battles in the <rs>West</rs> are meant, at least by those who do the fighting, to represent something entirely different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>The <rs>West</rs> is not yet abolitionized, and if the actual, honest question were before it, would fight for &#x0022;negro slavery&#x0022; rather than amalgamation or &#x0022;impartial freedom&#x0022; They are deluded and betrayed by the <rs>East</rs>, and made the tools of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> enpidity and fanaticism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>All the people living on the <rs>Mississippi</rs> are the same people, have the same ideas, the same interests, and forced into conflict with each other by distant and remote communities, the battles they fight are among the saddest things the world ever saw, and enough to make even <persName><foreName>Ange</foreName></persName>'s weep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>Those of the <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522"><rs type="direction">upper</rs> Mississippi</placeName> raise wheat, pork, beef stock, &#x0026;c., while those below them raise cotton, tobacco, sugar, &#x0026;c., and <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> has bestowed on them this mighty river for the exchange of their products.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>In the natural order of things, and the development of Democratic institutions, they should acquire Cubs, Hayti, <placeName key="tgn,7016739" n="1.000 126" reg="central america">Central America</placeName>, &#x0026;c, and restore industry and civilization to the naturally fertile and genial regions now blasted and withered by the <unclear>bi</unclear> Abolition delusion, and, if necessary, the man at the northern sources of the great river should come to the aid of the man at its southern outlet for the extension of so called slavery and the accomplishment of their common destiny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>The citizen of <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> or <placeName reg="Wisconsin" key="tgn,7007922">Wisconsin</placeName>, in exchanging the products of his labor with the producer of the <rs>South</rs>, should have sugar at <measure n="6cents" type="currency">six cents</measure> a pound and other things in proportion, and some day, when reason and interest, instead of folly, and crime, and fanaticism, rule the hour, all this will be realized. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/> Meanwhile, these people of the great valley, these <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs>, whose interests and whose destinies are indivisible, are cutting each other's throats with the utmost fury.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>As observed, there is no difference, even of abstract sentiment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>Unlike the <rs>East</rs>, they refuse to amalgamate the negro in their system, as absolutely as in <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, and if really forced among them by <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> &#x0026;c., would fight as promptly for &#x0022;slavery, &#x0022; or for retaining the negro in his normal condition, as does the former.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>What then are these brothers in the great valley fighting for?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>Why it is said a &#x0022;flag!&#x0022; Well, that would do, certainly, if the &#x0022;flag&#x0022; represents their principles; but if otherwise, if it is made the symbol of all that they hate, and all that is hostel to their own welfare, why then they are as besotted and object as the slaves of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> or <placeName reg="Rossiya" key="tgn,7002435">Russia</placeName>, who <unclear></unclear> ship idols in the form of <placeName key="possibilities=15" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Kings</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>Again, it is said that they are fighting for &#x0022;free trade&#x0022; on the <rs>Mississippi</rs> &mdash; that is, fighting for the tariff plunderers of the <rs>East</rs>, who tax them all alike, and against the actual free traders of the <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522"><rs type="direction">lower</rs> Mississippi</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>It is all a delusion; a criminal, awful mistake.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>The men of the <rs>West</rs> utterly abhor Abolitionism, <persName><foreName>Puritanism</foreName></persName>, tariffism, and all the other devilisms of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>They want free trade and union with all <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs>; but, above all, with their own natural brothers of the <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522"><rs type="direction">lower</rs> Mississippi</placeName>, rather than with <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginians</rs> or Vermonters; and if <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> resists this, and demands special privileges in the form of tariffs and, moreover, insists on cutting each other's throats to carry out her &#x0022;idea&#x0022; of negroes, then let her look to it that the disunion which she creates is not visited on her own guilty head. </p> </q><bibl n="The Destiny of the West"></bibl></cit>
