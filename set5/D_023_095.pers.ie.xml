<head>The Approaching Crisis.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/> The very <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> day of the late session we appealed to Congress, in the strongest <unclear>forms </unclear> we were capable of employing, to pass all the laws necessary to give conscription full effect as soon as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>Instead of doing so they wasted <measure n="6weeks" type="date">six weeks</measure> in discussing the conscription bill, which, after all, was passed under the spur of the previous question. --The members seemed to be seized with the same lethargy that <unclear>benumbed</unclear> their faculties after <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>They thought that because our troops had driven the enemy from <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> there was to be no more fighting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>in this delusion they were encouraged by the <rs>President</rs>, who told them that no immediate increase of the army was necessary.--The infatuation that dictated such an annunciation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>was amazing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had not only determined on, but had already begun to levy a new force of <num value="600000">six hundred thousand</num> men. That force, we <unclear></unclear> peaked declared, would be raised in a very short time, and we were not wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>It is already <unclear></unclear> in great part; is drilling as rapidly as it can and by the time the cold weather sets in it will be upon us. We shall have another <q> &#x0022;on to <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>,&#x0022;</q> and that is a very short time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>The advance of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00161" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,nomatch:0"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName> indicates thus much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>But an advance in that direction will not be all. <persName n="Sigel,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00162" reg="mostcommon:Sigel,nomatch:0"><surname>Sigel</surname></persName>'s levies, if we are to credit the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> accounts, are to bear down upon us from <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> by the line of the <orgName n="Orange and Alexandria Railroad" type="railroad">Orange and Alexandria railroad</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>They are to accomplish the <num value="2">two</num>-fold task of taking <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> and cutting off <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00163" reg="nearbymention:Lee,R.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>That great military oracle the <orgName n="New York Times" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName>, has already laid down the programme, Nothing is easier, it thinks, than to march straight into <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 6" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, and if permitted to be done, undoubtedly nothing would be easier.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>The <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> in its peculiar style, calls upon us to lay down our arms and submit to the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/> Where there is much smoke there is sure to be some fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>Through the mist of all this vaporing we can perceive a steady purpose to push us to the uttermost.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>An invasion is designed to which <unclear></unclear> that we have yet seen of invasion is mere child's play.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>We speak it &mdash; not for the purpose of creating unnecessary alarm &mdash; but warn our people of what they have to expect, and to prepare them for the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>We know not what preparations may have been made to meet and repel the foe; but we know that the authorities are well aware of his intentions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>We hope, therefore, that everything has been done which the occasion requires. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/> The people of the <rs>Confederates States</rs> will meet this new invasion as they met that which preceded it &mdash; with the promptness and gallantry becoming men who have no superior in those qualities, and with that firmness which nerves the soul to dare the utmost that an enemy can inflict.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>We have no belief that we can be finally beaten here upon our own soil, fighting for our altars and our firesides &mdash; But we must dismiss all illusions, agreeable as they may be, and learn to look at the grim reality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>it is war in its most gloomy aspect that we are called upon to endure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>War for the purpose of reducing us to slavery&#x0022;war for the purpose if converting the <rs>South</rs> in a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> <persName n="San,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00164" reg="mostcommon:San,nomatch:0"><surname>San</surname></persName>. <persName><foreName>Domingo</foreName></persName> &mdash; war which invokes the aid of the negroes to destroy all ages, sexes, and conditions. </p> </div3>
