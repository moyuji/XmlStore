<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/> We know not what may have been the dispositions made to meet the invasion of <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00301" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, which was certainly among the contingencies that ought to have been, and we suppose were, anticipated as consequent upon the movement of <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00302" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName> to his rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>Of this, however, we feel assured: that if the population of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> and <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> be only half as patriotic as they have credit for being, his situation must be perilous in the extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>He has entirely cut himself off from all communication with his base of supplies, which lies at <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>, <measure n="250miles" type="distance">two hundred and fifty miles</measure> off. His army is a flying column, and cannot, therefore, be supposed to encumber itself with many wagons and much provision.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>The country through which he is passing is thinly settled, and the population bitterly hostile.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>Here are as many elements of danger to an invader as it is usual to find upon occasions of the sort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>If the population be only true to themselves and their country, we see not how he can possibly escape disaster. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/> We are still at a loss to understand the ulterior object of <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00303" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> papers, more than a month ago, gave out that the seat of war was to be the cotton States this winter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>If such be the design, and this the execution of it, the certainty that he will move upon <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> or <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, in order to secure a base for future operations, seems pretty well established.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>Once in <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> or <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, however, he will find himself as effectually besieged there as <persName n="Howe,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00304" reg="mostcommon:Howe,nomatch:0"><surname>Howe</surname></persName> was in <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> when <persName n="Franklin,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00305" reg="mostcommon:Franklin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Franklin</surname></persName> wrote, that instead of <persName n="Howe,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00306" reg="mostcommon:Howe,nomatch:0"><surname>Howe</surname></persName> taking <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014406">Philadelphia</placeName> had taken <persName n="Howe,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00307" reg="mostcommon:Howe,nomatch:0"><surname>Howe</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>A <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate army</orgName>, lying before whichever of these cities he may select, will effectually bar his entrance into the country and render his army &mdash; save in the article of employing so large a force to blockade it &mdash; as useless as though it did not exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>To take position in <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> or <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> is to place himself in precisely the same position with <persName n="Howe,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00308" reg="mostcommon:Howe,nomatch:0"><surname>Howe</surname></persName> and <persName n="Clinton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00309" reg="mostcommon:Clinton,nomatch:0"><surname>Clinton</surname></persName> in New York.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>They had the city, with good quarters and a powerful fleet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/><placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> lay above them, watching them carefully, cutting off their parties whenever they ventured out; or, when they come out in full force, taking up such strong ground and offering battle on such terms that they did not dare, in a single instance, to accept it. If it be the intention of <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00310" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> to take either of these cities, he has <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to take it, which he will find no easy job; secondly, to operate in the country, which, with the army that will certainly confront him, he will find no easy undertaking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>As for opening any communication with the country he has left behind him, that we take to be out of the question. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/> In the <name>Revolutionary</name> war, the <rs>British</rs>, besides having possession of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> and <placeName reg="Georgetown, Washington, District of Columbia" key="tgn,7015724">Georgetown</placeName>, had posts all through the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>When they were finally compelled to abandon these latter, they all retired into <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, and <persName n="Green,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00311" reg="mostcommon:Green,nomatch:0"><surname>Green</surname></persName> held the whole country, while they attempted no farther enterprise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>If <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00312" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> go to either <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> or <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, and there be shut up by our armies, it will probably be the best thing that can happen to either of these States, since it will be the means of leaving them free and uninterrupted by the presence of the enemy in the agricultural country. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/> Our own impression, however, is that this expedition has been undertaken with a view to render assistance to <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00313" reg="nearbymention:Grant,James,W.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/><placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName> or <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> once taken, it would be very easy to transfer <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00314" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s whole force to the lines before <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> and <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/><placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> is now the prevailing <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> idea; and all other enterprises dwindle into insignificance in comparison with that directed immediately against <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
