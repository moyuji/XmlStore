<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/> In considering the state of the country, the reflection is naturally suggested, that this is the <orgName n="Confederate States Congress 3" type="congress">third Congress of the Confederate States of <placeName reg="America, Walker, Alabama" key="tgn,2002460">America</placeName></orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>The Provisional Government was formed, its Congress held <num value="4">four</num> sessions, lived its appointed term, and passed away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>The permanent Government was then organised, its different Departments established, a Congress elected which also held <num value="4">four</num> sessions, served its full constitutional term and expired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>You, the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> Congress, under the permanent Government, are now assembled at the time and place appointed by law for commencing your session.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>All these events have passed into history, notwithstanding the threat of our prompt subjugation, made <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> ago, by a people that presume to assert a title to govern States whose separate and independent sovereignty was recognized by treaty with <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> and <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> in the last century, and remained unquestioned for nearly <num value="3">three</num> generations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>Yet these very governments, in disregard of duty and treaty obligations which bind them to recognise as independent, <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and other <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, persist in countenancing, by moral influence, if not in aiding by unfair and partial action, the claim set up by the <rs>Executive</rs> of a foreign Government, to exercise despotic away over the <name>States</name> thus recognized, and treat the invasion of them by their former limited and special agent as though it were the attempt of a sovereign to suppress a rebellion against lawful authority. --Ungenerous advantage has been taken of our present condition, and our rights have been violated, our vessels-of-war detained in ports to which they had been invited by proclamations of neutrality, and in <num value="1">one</num> instance our flag also insulted where the sacred right of asylum was supposed to be secure; while <num value="1">one</num> of these Governments has contented itself with simply deprecating by deferential representations the conduct of our enemy in the constantly recurring instances of his contemptuous disregard of neutral rights and flagrant violations of public law. It may be that foreign Governments, like our enemies, have mistaken our desire for peace, unreservedly expressed, for evidence of exhaustion, and have thence inferred the probability of success in the effort to subjugate or exterminate the <num value="1000000">millions</num> of human beings who, in these States, prefer any fate to submission to their savage assailants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>I see no prospect of an early change in the course heretofore pursued by these Governments; but when this delusion shall have been dispelled, and when our independence, by the valor and fortitude of our people, shall have been won against all the hostile influences combined against us, and can no longer be ignored by open foes or professed neutrals, this war will have left with its proud memories a record of many wrongs, which it may not misbecome us to forgive &mdash; some for which we may not properly forbear from demanding redress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>In the meantime it is enough for us to know that every avenue of negotiation is closed against us; that our enemy is making renewed and strenuous efforts for our destruction, and that the sole resource for us, as a people secure in the justice of our cause, and holding our liberties to be more precious than all other earthly possessions, is to combine and apply every available element of power for their defence and preservation. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/> The report of the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> states facts justifying the conclusion that the law passed at the last session for the purpose of withdrawing from circulation the large excess of Treasury notes heretofore issued, has had the desired effect; and that by the <date value="07- 01">1st July</date> the amount in circulation will have been reduced to a sum not exceeding <measure n="230000000dollars" type="currency">$230,000,000</measure>. It is believed to be of primary importance that no further issue of notes should take place, and that the use of the credit of the <rs>Government</rs> should be restricted to the <num value="2">two</num> other modes provided by Congress, viz: the rule of bonds and the issue of certificates bearing interest, for the price of supplies purchased within our limits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>The law, as it now stands, authorizes the issue by the <name>Treasury</name> of new notes to the extent of <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of the amount received under its provisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>The estimate of the amount funded under the law, is shown to be <measure n="300000000dollars" type="currency">$300,000,000</measure>, and if <num value="2">two</num> <num value=".333">thirds</num> of this sum be re-issued, we shall have an addition of <measure n="200000000dollars" type="currency">$200,000,000</measure> to our circulation, de- <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> lieved to be already ample for the business of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>The addition of this large sum to the volume of the currency would be attended by disastrous effects, and would produce the speedy recurrence of the evils from which the funding law has rescued the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>If our arms are crowned with the success which we have so much reason to hope, we may well expect that this war cannot be prolonged beyond the current year, and nothing would so much retard the beneficent influence of peace on all the interests of our country, as the existence of a great mass of currency not redeemable in coin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>With our viz.: resources, the circulation, if restricted to its present volume, would be easily manageable, and by gradual absorption in payment of public dues, would give place to the precious metals, the only basis of a currency adapted to commerce with foreign countries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>In our present circumstances I know of no mode of providing for the public wants which would entail sacrifices so great as a fresh issue of Treasury notes, and I trust that you will concur in the propriety of absolutely forbidding any increase of those now in circulation. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="345"/> We lay before our readers this morning <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00310" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName>'s report of his operations around <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, including the battles of <placeName reg="Lookout Mountain, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100143">Lookout Mountain</placeName> and <placeName reg="Missionary Ridge, Hickman, Tennessee" key="tgn,2518191">Missionary Ridge</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>It is a document of great historical interest, is correct in most of its statements, evinces unusual candor and modesty for a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> officer, and will do much to clear up the doubt and uncertainty which certain parties have endeavored to throw over the campaign in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248"><rs type="direction">North</rs> Georgia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>It will be seen that the report sustains, in a remarkable degree, the account given at the time to the readers of the <hi rend="italics">Dispatch</hi> by our correspondent, &#x0022;Sallust,&#x0022; the principal difference between the <num value="2">two</num> relating to the partial suppression of the fact by <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00311" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> that his <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName> was severely repulsed at <placeName reg="Missionary Ridge, Hickman, Tennessee" key="tgn,2518191">Missionary Ridge</placeName> by <persName n="Hardee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00312" reg="mostcommon:Hardee,nomatch:0"><surname>Hardee</surname></persName>, and the claim set up that his pursuing column succeeded in dislodging the <rs>Confederates</rs> at <placeName reg="Ringgold Gap">Ringgold Gap</placeName> the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> day after the battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>The truth is, as was stated by &#x0022;Sallust,&#x0022; the left wings of both armies were beaten at <placeName reg="Missionary Ridge, Hickman, Tennessee" key="tgn,2518191">Missionary Ridge</placeName>, while the right wings of both were victorious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="349"/>Had <persName n="Breckinridge,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00313" reg="mostcommon:Breckinridge,nomatch:0"><surname>Breckinridge</surname></persName> maintained his ground on the left as <persName n="Hardee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00314" reg="mostcommon:Hardee,nomatch:0"><surname>Hardee</surname></persName> did his on the right, the repulse of the enemy would have been complete.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="350"/>In regard to the affair at <placeName reg="Ringgold Gap">Ringgold Gap</placeName>, it is not quite correct to say that the <rs>Confederates</rs> were dislodged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="351"/>It would be nearer the truth to say that the enemy's advance was beaten with heavy loss by that modest and gallant soldier, <persName n="Cleburne,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00315" reg="mostcommon:Cleburne,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Cleburne</surname></persName>, of <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Hardee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00316" reg="mostcommon:Hardee,nomatch:0"><surname>Hardee</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName>, after which the <rs>Confederate</rs> <orgName n="Rear Guard" type="military">rear guard</orgName> retired to <placeName reg="Dalton, Whitfield, Georgia" key="tgn,2022620">Dalton</placeName>, whither the main army had already retreated. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="353"/>We learn from official sources that our entire loss including killed, wounded and prisoners, was not so great as he claims the prisoners to have been. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="354"/> But the most interesting part of the report relates to the half-starved condition of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> army when <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00318" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> arrived at <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, and the loss of <placeName reg="Lookout Valley, Buffalo, Wisconsin" key="tgn,2469816">Lookout Valley</placeName> and <placeName reg="Brown's Ferry">Brown's Ferry</placeName> by the <rs>Confederates</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="355"/>The confession of <persName n="Grant,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00319" reg="nearbymention:Grant,U.,S.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Grant</surname></persName> upon these points is remarkable, and shows that the valley and ferry were the key to his whole position, and that if we had held there, for <num value="1">one</num> week longer, as <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00320" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Brenton,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName> believes we ought and could have done, the enemy would have been forced to evacuate <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> for want of supplies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="356"/>The reader will remember with what clearness all these things were pointed out at the time by our correspondent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="357"/>The report is conclusive upon the act that <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00321" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Brenton,,,"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName> displayed much foresight when he invested the town, instead of attempting a flank movement across the river and mountains into <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">Middle</rs> Tennessee</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="358"/> As to the movement of <persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00322" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName> upon <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName>, but little need be said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="359"/>He was sent against that town with the knowledge and consent of the <rs>President</rs>, who was then on a visit to the army, and it was believed at the time that he would be able to effect the reduction of the place and return to <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> before the arrival from <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName> of <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00323" reg="nearbymention:Sherman,Gen,,,"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName>, of the movements of which <persName n="Bragg,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00324" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Brenton,,,"><surname>Bragg</surname></persName> kept himself well informed Whether the obstacles which <persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00325" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName> encountered were more formidable than had been anticipated, or whether he moved with the rapidity which the occasion required, it would be obviously improper for us to undertake to say, in the absence of the official report.
