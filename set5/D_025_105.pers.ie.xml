<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/> I left <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName> <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure> ago. At that time nothing of especial importance as regards field operations was transpiring at that point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Our officers and the enemy communicated almost everyday via the picket lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Reports reaching us through rebel couriers represented the <rs>Union</rs> movements at several points in a favorable light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>When I left <placeName reg="Bridgeport Landing, Wilcox, Alabama" key="tgn,2194506">Bridgeport, Ala.</placeName>, reports came in that the rebel <persName n="Wheeler,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Wheeler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Wheeler</surname></persName> was again about to threaten our lines of railroad communication between here and <placeName reg="Bridgeport, Cocke, Tennessee" key="tgn,2098103">Bridgeport</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Later reports seem to confirm this. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> It is evident there is a force of rebels attempting to interrupt our railroad line of communication with the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>A short time since a train was thrown from the track in consequence of the displacement of new rails, by which several persons were injured &mdash; some seriously.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>It is to be hoped that by far the worst of the plot has developed itself. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> About <time value="12oclock">twelve o'clock</time> last night a very unusual affair occurred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>It seems a torpedo was sunk in the ground at a point <measure n="3miles" type="distance">three miles</measure> this side of <placeName reg="Taunton, Bristol, Massachusetts" key="tgn,7014569">Taunton</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>Several freight and passenger cars, well loaded, passed over the torpedo.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>As the locomotive which had been acting as pusher up the mountain was going back it exploded the torpedo, throwing the tender off the track, tearing it almost to pieces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Fortunately, no <num value="1">one</num> was seriously injured.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>During this afternoon the same train was thrown off the track between here and <placeName key="tgn,2100014" n="1.000 12" reg="la vergne, rutherford, tennessee">Lavergne</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Many of the passengers jumped out of the car windows and off the top of the cars, but none, very fortunately, sustained injuries that will lay them up. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>They were eminently successful, took some prisoners, gained important military information, and <measure n="3" type="captured">captured three</measure> cars and a locomotive. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> Do not think our forces are inactive at the front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Although the roads are very had you will hear favorable news before long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>We <hi rend="italics">took <num value="1">one</num></hi> prisoner, who, it was evident, was engaged in throwing cars from the track.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The passengers wanted to hang him on the spot.
