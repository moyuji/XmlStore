<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>No attempt was made to re-establish the outer line, and consequently the rumor to that effect was without foundation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>During the skirmish there was considerable cannonading and musketry firing, which virtually misled those at a distance as to the magnitude of the affair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>An apprehension that the <rs>Confederates</rs> would attempt to re-establish the original lines led the enemy to make preparations to meet it, not only by strengthening his skirmishers in front, but by bringing up a considerable force of supports in their rear. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/> I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter informing me of my nomination by the <orgName n="Democratic National Convention" type="convention">Democratic National Convention</orgName>, recently assembled at <placeName key="tgn,7013596" n="1.000 372" reg="chicago, cook, illinois">Chicago</placeName>, as their candidate at the next election for <rs type="role" reg="President">President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/> It is unnecessary for me to say to you that this nomination comes to me unsought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>I am happy to know that, when the nomination was made, the record of my public life was kept in view. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/> The effect of long and varied service in the army, during war and peace, has been to strengthen and make indelible in my mind and heart the love and reverence for the <rs>Union</rs>, Constitution, laws and flag of our country, impressed upon me in early youth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>These feelings have thus for guided the course of my life, and must continue to do so to its end. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/> The existence of more than <num value="1">one</num> government over the region <unclear></unclear> our flag is incompatible with the <unclear></unclear> and the happiness of the people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/> The <unclear>prescr</unclear> Union was the sole avowed object for which the war was commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>It should have been conducted for that object only, and in accordance with those principles which I took occasion to declare when in active service. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/> Thus conducted, the work of reconciliation would </p> <milestone unit="column" n="6"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/> have been easy, and we might have reaped the benefits of our many victories on land and sea. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/> The Union was originally formed by the exercise of a spirit of conciliation and compromise: To restore and preserve it, the same spirit must prevail in our councils and in the hearts of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>The re-establishment of the <rs>Union</rs> in all its integrity is, and must continue to be, the indispensable condition in any settlement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>So soon as it is clear, or even probable, that our present adversaries are ready for peace upon the basis of the <rs>Union</rs>, we should exhaust all the resource of statesmanship practiced by civilized nations, and taught by the traditions of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> people, consistent with the honor and interest of the country, to secure such peace, re-establish the <rs>Union</rs>, and guarantee for the future the constitutional rights of every State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>The Union is the <num value="1">one</num> condition of peace; we ask no more. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/> Let me add, what I doubt not was, although unexpressed, the sentiment of the convention; as it is of the people they represent, that when any <num value="1">one</num> State is willing to return to the <rs>Union</rs>, it should be received at once, with a full guarantee of all its constitutional rights. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/> If a frank, earnest, and persistent effort to obtain these objects should fail, the responsibility for ulterior consequences will fall upon these who remain in arms against the <rs>Union</rs>; but the <rs>Union</rs> must be preserved at all hazards. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/> I could not look in the face of my gallant comrades of the army and navy, who have survived so many bloody battles, and tell them that their labors and the sacrifice of so many of our slain and wounded brethren had been in vain &mdash; that we had abandoned that Union for which we have so often periled our lives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>A vast majority of our people, whether in the army and navy or at home, would, as I would, hail with unbounded joy the permanent restoration of peace on the basis of the <rs>Union</rs>, under the <rs>Constitution</rs> without the effusion of another drop of blood, But no peace can be permanent without union. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/> As to the other subjects presented in the resolutions of the convention, I need only say that I should seek in the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, and the laws framed in the ordnance therewith, the rule of my duty and the limitations of executive power; endeavor to restore economy in the public expenditures, re-establish the supremacy of law, and, by the operation of a more vigorous nationality, resume our commanding position among the nations of the earth. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/> The condition of our finances, the depreciation of the paper money, and the burden thereby imposed on labor and capital, show the necessity of a return to a sound, financial system; while the rights of citizens and the rights of States, and the binding authority of law over <rs type="role2">President</rs>, army and people, are subjects of not less vital importance in war than in peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>Believing that the views here expressed are those of the convention and the people you represent, I accept the nomination. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/> I realize the weight of the responsibility to be borne should the people ratify your choice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>Conscious of my own weakness, I can only seek fervently the guidance of the <name>Ruler</name> of the <name>Universe</name>, and, relying on His all-powerful aid, do my best to restore union and peace to a suffering people, and to establish and guard their liberties and rights. </p> <closer> <salute>I am, gentlemen, very respectfully,<lb/>Your obedient servant,</salute> <lb/> <signed><persName n="McClellan,,George,B.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00054" reg="default:McClellan,George,B.,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName>  <surname>McClellan</surname></persName>.</signed> <lb/> <persName n="Seymour,the Honorable,Horatia,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00055" reg="default:Seymour,Horatia,,,"><roleName n="the Honorable">Hon.</roleName> <foreName>Horatia</foreName> <surname>Seymour</surname></persName> and others, Committee. </closer> </div5> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/> <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00152" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> belongs to that nest of vipers which the <rs>South</rs> had been unconsciously nourishing in its bosom for <measure n="80years" type="date">eighty years</measure> before the commencement of this war. When it broke out he was president of a college in <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, enjoying a large salary, and professing undying devotion to the <rs>South</rs>, to its institutions, and to its people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>So strong did he pretend that this feeling was in him, that he declared, when war became inevitable, his determination never to draw his sword against the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>He was treated in <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName> with the unbounded kindness which that hospitable and high-spirited people always extended to strangers as long as they had the power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>He was received into their families on the footing of an old and valued acquaintance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>Every house was thrown open to him, and he had a seat at every table whenever he thought proper to occupy it. The return he has made, while it is not very creditable to himself, could not have been more instructive to the <rs>Southern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>Before the war there was always on the part of that people &mdash; in every State, without exception,--a disposition to prefer <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> candidates for office to those who were born in their midst, even when the qualifications of the latter greatly exceeded those of the former.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>By steadily adhering to the policy indicated by this disposition, in course of time, and with great care, the <rs>South</rs> succeeded in accumulating that nest of vipers of which we have just spoken; and if they now sting her whenever the opportunity offers, she may thank herself for the infliction. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/> Of all the remorseless, hard-hearted, unfeeling brutes that Yankeedom has sent forth to waste the <rs>South</rs>, this man is the most remorseless, the most hard-hearted and the most brutal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/><persName n="Tacitus,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00153" reg="mostcommon:Tacitus,nomatch:0"><surname>Tacitus</surname></persName> says that when you confer a favor on a man, if it be of such a magnitude that he can repay it, he will be grateful for it; but when it is so great that he can never hope to make a proper return, instead of considering it a favor, he will hate you for it. <persName n="Tacitus,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00154" reg="mostcommon:Tacitus,nomatch:0"><surname>Tacitus</surname></persName> lived in the worst era of the world and in the most universally corrupt society of which there is any account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>He drew his pictures from nature as it presented itself to him. The observation we have alluded to was, no doubt, true with regard to those among whom he lived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>It is to be hoped, however, it is not true of the world in general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>Of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, however, it is eminently true, and to <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00155" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> it applies with greater force than any other <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> (even) of whom we recollect to have heard. --The favors he received at the hands of the <rs>South</rs> were not only far greater than he deserved, but such as he could never hope to repay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>Hence the undying hatred with which he visits upon the <rs>South</rs> its great sin of over-estimating his merits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>Others have dealt harshly with the <rs>Southern</rs> people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/>Fortunately for her cause, there have been few exceptions among the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> in this particular.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>But <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00156" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> surpasses them all. He takes the law into his own hands &mdash; decides that we are rebels &mdash; declares that rebels have no rights &mdash; and insists upon it that his victims shall be grateful to him for sparing their lives, which, according to his interpretation of public law, have been forfeited to <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00157" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>His proceedings have been in strict accordance with his principles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>Under his rule the horrors of war have been aggravated to an extent which it is appalling to think of. He is avenging himself upon his former friends and admirers for the good opinion they once had of him. He is teaching them a wholesome lesson, and we hope they will profit by it. He is teaching them never again, under any circumstances, to trust a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>, no matter how fair an outside he may present. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/> In the wholesale expulsion of the inhabitants from <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>, he seems to have had several objects in view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>He sees that the country is rising behind him as fast as he moves forward, and that the ground on which his forts are built is the only ground that he really holds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>He knows that the country, by this process, must all return to the <rs>Confederates</rs>, and he, therefore, wishes to leave no population in the rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/><num value="2" type="ordinal">Second</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>He wishes to convert the whole of <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> into a vast fort or arsenal, with no Confederates about it to give notice of his movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>Thirdly. He wishes to intimidate, debase and subdue by severity, making the mistake common to all vulgar and cruel natures, of measuring everybody by his own standard; for these measures will inflame instead of intimidate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>That he means to send the greater part of his force to <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00158" reg="mostcommon:Grant,nomatch:0"><surname>Grant</surname></persName>, we believe to be certain, as we believe to be unfounded a report very generally prevailing that, just as he is about to do so, our authorities are on the point of depleting <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00159" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> to reinforce <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00160" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>We expected no less, nor do we believe that less would have been accepted by any party at the <rs>North</rs>.--The restoration of the <rs>Union</rs> is, with him, an indispensable pre-requisite to the restoration of peace; and if negotiation fail, he is in favor of restoration by the sword.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>It is true he finds fault with the manner in which the war has been conducted, but against the war itself he has nothing to say.
