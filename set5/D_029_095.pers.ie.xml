<head>Stay law in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/> The <orgName n="New York Times" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName>, referring to the stay law before the <name>Legislature</name> of this State, says it is a very unwise thing for a people seeking and needing credit, from the <rs>North</rs> and <rs>Europe</rs>, to proclaim to the world that while they are willing to contract new obligations, they decline, or are unable, to pay old ones.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>On the strength of the prospective crops of cotton and tobacco, the <rs>Northern</rs> merchants are supplying Southern wants liberally and on favorable terms. &#x0022;But who can expect them,&#x0022; it is asked, &#x0022;to trust men now who hasten &#x0022;to repudiation, and who take away from &#x0022;credit its props and safeguards?&#x0022; It is then intimated that, in passing these stay laws, our people are actuated more by feelings of revenge than by any motive of public policy, and the writer adds; &#x0022;We are not surprised &#x0022;that <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> should originate such a law, &#x0022;for the past has made her familiar with repudiation; but that <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, priding herself upon her honor as a Common wealth, &#x0022;should follow an example so bad, is strange &#x0022; and inexplicable.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/> We trust our contemporary will do <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> the justice to publish the real facts connected with this subject, which differ widely from those assumed in his commentary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>The temporary legislation adopted at the present session <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> of the <orgName n="Virginia Legislature" type="legislature">Virginia Legislature</orgName> consists in amendments of pre-existing stay laws, which were passed under the <rs>State</rs> government during the war, and intended to afford relief to the people who were deprived of their usual means of paying their debts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>No purpose of revenge could, by any possibility, have prompted their enactment; and when we state that the proposed amendment adopted by this Legislature expressly excepts from the benefit of its provisions debts contracted since the <date value="04-03">3d of April,</date> our contemporary must himself see the grievous injustice of his imputations upon the motives of our Legislature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>The only design of the stay law was, and is, to save our people, who have nothing left them but their lands, from the enforced collection of debts; but a new provision is now added, by which all debts incurred since the <date value="04-03">3d of April,</date> and therefore including all that has been advanced by Northern capitalists for our relief, are explicitly excepted from the benefits of the stay law. The legislation thus far is expressly declared to remain in force during the present session of the <name>Legislature</name>, and if any further amendments are necessary to secure to Northern creditors their rights, they will no doubt be promptly made. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/> It is the enough that <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> prides herself upon her honor as a Commonwealth, but it will be time enough when she repudiates her honest debts, to see anything in her conduct &#x0022;strange and inexplicable.&#x0022; In her deepest distress and poverty she has not forgotten her ancient integrity, and will pay not only every dollar of her indebtedness since the <date value="04-03">3d of April,</date> but, as soon as she recovers from the <unclear> </unclear> the war has entailed <unclear></unclear> remembered that just before the <unclear> </unclear> adjourned for the holidays a bill passed the <name>Senate</name>, and will, without doubt, be passed by the <rs type="place">House</rs> after the recess, authorizing the <name>Trustees</name> of <placeName reg="Manchester, Manchester, England" key="tgn,7010477">Manchester</placeName> to borrow money on the credit of the town to build a bridge across <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">James river</placeName> at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>Preparations are now being made to construct it at once.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>Able and experienced engineers are about to commence surveys to select the best site, and to prepare plans and estimates for its construction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>Whether the bridge will be of wood, iron or stone, is not yet determined, but the present intention is to make it of the most durable material and in the best manner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>When the several sites have been surveyed &mdash; some above and some below the present bridge, and reported on &mdash; then there will be an interesting question, and possibly some competition <hi rend="italics">on this side</hi> of the river as to its location.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>It will be, of course, greatly to the interest of merchants that the bridge should bring the line of travel along their streets, and the value of property at the terminus of the bridge will be greatly increased. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/> We therefore expect that handsome offers will be made by capitalists in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> to secure to themselves such a terminus of the bridge as will be most advantageous to themselves, and these offers would be perfectly legitimate, and would surely be considered by the founders of the bridge. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/> The whole object of this bridge is to make toll rates as low as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>There is an earnest wish all through <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Manchester</placeName> for the establishment of a free bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>This is no doubt desirable, but, to the <name>Trustees</name>, does not seem at present practicable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>It has been held that if a free bridge were to be built by the town of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Manchester</placeName>, the increased value of the property in that town would more than pay for the bridge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>This may be partly true; but in that case the entire weight of the expense would fall upon the town, while the whole south-side country who use the bridge constantly could go and come at pleasure, and have not a cent to pay. It is for this reason that the toll system is adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>Under its operation those who use the bridge &mdash; and those only &mdash; pay for it, and pay in exact proportion to that use. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/> It should be stated, however, that the <name>Treasury</name> of the town of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Manchester</placeName> gains nothing directly by the building of the bridge, and only gains indirectly by the advantage of increasing the business of the place, and by enhancing the value of its taxable property.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>The charter explicitly states that the highest rate of toll shall be the lowest rate that was charged by the present bridge in <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, and that no higher rate shall ever be charged than is sufficient to keep the bridge in repair and to re-build it in case it should be destroyed by fire or flood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>The projectors of this enterprise consider that competition is not to be feared by the town of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Manchester</placeName>; for should the existing bridge charge a less rate of tolls than the new <num value="1">one</num>, the very object of the new bridge would be gained; <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> <unclear></unclear> cheap toll.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>The town could well afford to pay the losses arising out of the competition by reason of the great increase of its business, and increase in the value of its <rs n="real estate" type="product">real estate</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/> It is to be hoped that the bridge will be a handsome as well as a stable <num value="1">one</num>; that it will be well lighted and have broad sidewalks, thus being an ornament to the city as well as to the town, and a pleasant promenade to the waterside citizens on summer evenings. </p> </div3>

<head>Labor in the <rs>South</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/> Many prominent planters of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> have expressed the opinion that the negroes of that State, if properly paid and well treated, will work under the new system.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>The same encouraging expectations would seem to be warranted in other cotton States, from the paragraph of the <placeName reg="Montgomery, Montgomery, Alabama" key="tgn,7013928">Montgomery (Ala.)</placeName> <hi rend="italics">ledger,</hi> published in this journal yesterday, warning the planters against the danger of an over-crop of cotton. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/> We heartily trust that these agreeable anticipations may be realized.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>With the exercise of forbearance and patience, it may, and we hope will, prove that the <rs>South</rs> will retain the industry that has been hitherto so productive, and that the colored race will realize that the whites are their best friends, and become contented, happy and prosperous laborers. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>Thereupon <persName n="Wilson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00201" reg="mostcommon:Wilson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName> proceeded to say substantially as follows: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/> &#x0022;<rs type="role" reg="Mister President">Mr. President</rs>, you have, no doubt, been informed of the resolution I offered to-day in the <rs type="place">House</rs>, and of the vote upon it. In explanation of it I wish to say that neither myself nor the rest of the majority voting for it are disposed to make any distinction between <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> and the other States lately engaged in rebellion in our preliminary examination into their respective claims to representation in Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>At the same time, the <rs>Joint Committee</rs> of <num value="15">Fifteen</num> may, and probably will, extend to the former State priority of consideration by taking up and disposing of its case <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, and this the majority will not oppose.&#x0022; Passing from this special to the general subject of reconstruction at large, <persName n="Wilson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00202" reg="mostcommon:Wilson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName> continued: &#x0022;I am aware that there are men in Congress, styling themselves &#x0027;Conservatives,&#x0027; that claim to be your friends par excellence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>Now, I do not hesitate to avow that I am what is commonly called a &#x0027;Radical.&#x0027; I contributed, in my humble way, all I could to the success of the party that placed you in power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>Hence I claim the right to call myself the friends of your Administration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>Myself and those acting with me in Congress are all friendly to it, and desire its entire success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>But we think, and with us our constituencies, that by your plan of reconstruction that result is not likely to be attained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>We hold, at the same time, that there is <num value="1">one</num> way in which it could be reached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>In our opinion, your efforts to reorganize the rebel States and restore them to the <rs>Union</rs>, after an uninterrupted trial of some <measure n="7months" type="date">seven months</measure>, have not proved successful to the extent required to insure the future peace, safety and prosperity of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>Congress, in pursuance of what it considers its solemn duty, now proposes, after due investigation of the whole subject, to devise, if possible, some better plan of re-organization and restoration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>The plan Congress will probably adopt will be to submit such amendments to the <rs>Constitution</rs> as will, if accepted by the <rs>State Legislatures</rs>, furnish ample guarantees for the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>The majority of Congress expect and ask that, while engaged in investigating the whole subject of reconstruction, and devising some new plan, it may be left free to act as it may deem best, and that no attempt be made by the <rs>Executive</rs> to interfere with and influence its action by the distribution of patronage or in any other way. If thus left free by you, there can be no possible difficulty between the executive and legislative branches of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>But if you are disposed to interfere with Congress, by patronage or otherwise, and force your peculiar ideas and plans upon Congress and the country, you will meet with serious opposition by those that are now the friends of your Administration, and desire sincerely to make it successful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>The plan Congress will probably adopt will not render it necessary for you to surrender any of your own views in relation to reconstruction, inasmuch as, under the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, you cannot be asked to approve the resolutions of Congress submitting certain amendments to the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>You will not be responsible, for our action, but we will be responsible for it to our constituents, who will be called upon to determine upon the merits of our plan of reconstruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>Hence there will be no occasion for serious differences between the <rs>Executive</rs> and Congress if each branch of the <rs>Government</rs> simply leaves the other to do what it considers its duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>And let me add this: the so-called Conservatives of Congress, the men that claim to be your exclusive friends, go with you to-day because they think it is to their advantage to do so; but they will oppose you tomorrow if they shall find it is to their disadvantage to support you. You will find in the end that the men who differ from you to-day from sincere convictions, and honest, patriotic motives, are much more reliable and trustworthy friends than these time-servers.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="Mr. Wilson"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/> <placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName>, in reply, stated that he was anxious to avoid a division among the friends of his Administration in Congress; that he would regret to see any difficulties arise between them and the <rs>Executive</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>He then proceeded to review at length his policy of reconstruction, reiterating the points in support of it made in his published speeches, and more lately in his message; but said nothing that could be construed into an admission of its failure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>On the contrary, he seemed to be fully persuaded of its present and future success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>Nor did he say a word indicating an intention to abstain from interference with Congress in its legislation upon reconstruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>He did not say that he would interfere; but neither did he commit himself to the opposite line of action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>However pressed by <persName n="Wilson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00203" reg="mostcommon:Wilson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName> in this direction, he would not give the assurances desired of him. That he would have made a formal disclaimer of a purpose to meddle with Congress, if he did not entertain it, may be fairly presumed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="590"/>He evinced during the trial, and also subsequently, the keenest interest in the fate of the <num value="2">two</num> men who were executed on <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>, and seemed to feel something of disappointment when he saw that their names had become so notorious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="591"/>Better it seemed to him to fire an <rs n="Ephesian" type="ethnic">Ephesian</rs> dome than to go to the grave unknown; and so this miserable man &mdash; actuated by no motive, stimulated by no extreme indulgence, nerved by no object, supported by no well-grounded hope in the future &mdash; rushed wildly from existence merely, as it appears at present, that he might gratify the miserable wish to become notorious! </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="593"/>To him he said that he had been unfortunate in business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="594"/>He had made some money at <num value="1">one</num> time, but had again lost it. He had gone to <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName>, and been unsuccessful there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/>He had begun to come to the conclusion that his life was a mistake, when the excitement created by the execution of <persName n="Corbett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00353" reg="mostcommon:Corbett,nomatch:0"><surname>Corbett</surname></persName> and <persName n="Fleming,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00354" reg="mostcommon:Fleming,nomatch:0"><surname>Fleming</surname></persName> commenced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="600"/>He wished to die, he said, and he was determined that he would not live.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="601"/>He had taken the poison with perfect deliberation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="602"/>He had a rope fastened up in his office, which he had intended should be the means through which he should escape the torments of this world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="603"/>He sat and read the newspapers with perfect equanimity and coolness till the sickness of death began, and then he requested to be assisted to his room.

It seems that some colored men, very much under the influence of bad whisky, were amusing themselves by firing guns from the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> story of a house in this locality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="608"/>The police remonstrated, and finally went into the house and seized the muskets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="609"/>A large crowd of half drunken blacks gathered around, and, becoming very riotous in their conduct, the officers attempted to arrest <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="610"/>The prisoners, as fast as taken into custody, were rescued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="611"/>Additional police force was sent to the neighborhood by <persName n="Goldey,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00360" reg="mostcommon:Goldey,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant">Lieutenants</roleName> <surname>Goldey</surname></persName> and <persName n="Paullin,Lieutenant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00361" reg="mostcommon:Paullin,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Lieutenant"></roleName><surname>Paullin</surname></persName>, both of whom arrived in person and did much towards preventing a riot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="612"/>The blacks increased by hundreds, and a large number of whites arrived on the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="613"/>A collision between the <num value="2">two</num> classes was almost inevitable, and would certainly have resulted but for the timely arrival of the police.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="614"/>A guards was kept stationed in the neighborhood during the whole night.
