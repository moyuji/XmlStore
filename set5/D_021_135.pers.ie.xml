<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/> The friends of the <rs>Union</rs> will be glad to hear this, for it must be confessed that, after the reduction of <num value="2">two</num> such forts as <persName n="Jackson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00098" reg="mostcommon:Jackson,nomatch:0"><surname>Jackson</surname></persName> and <placeName reg="Saint Phillip, Posey, Indiana" key="tgn,7019002">St. Phillip</placeName> below, and <num value="2">two</num> such fortifications as <placeName reg="Columbus, Muscogee, Georgia" key="tgn,7013643">Columbus</placeName> and <placeName reg="Island Number Ten, New Madrid, Missouri" key="tgn,2552260">Island No.10</placeName> above, it is rather humiliating that a contemptible earthwork like <persName n="Pillow,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00099" reg="mostcommon:Pillow,nomatch:0"><surname>Pillow</surname></persName>, manned, as we have every reason to believe &mdash; indeed, I many almost say know &mdash; by <num value="2">two</num> regiments of raw troops and defended by not more than half a dozen guns of heavy calibre, should so long hold us at bay, and prevent the <unclear> ed</unclear> navigation of the <rs>Mississippi</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>It is a matter of <unclear></unclear> little speculation whether <placeName key="tgn,6002083" n="1.000 95" reg="fort pillow, lauderdale, tennessee">Fort Pillow</placeName> is defended at all. If the reports of deserters are to be believed, it was virtually abandoned several days ago; but since the engagement of he <num value="10" type="ordinal">10th</num>, when <num value="2">two</num> of our boats were disabled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>A portion of their fleet is still to the vicinity; but it is believed by many that it has been left behind as a <q>&#x0022;blind.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/> This hypothesis is strengthened by a circumstance which occurred a day or <num value="2">two</num> age. The <term type="ship">steamer</term> <rs type="ship">L. M.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>During the forenoon she dropped down into a bend of the river, flying <num value="2">two</num> flags of truce, and after waiting an hour and <num value="0.5">a half</num> for the enemy to board her was compelled to return.--While in this position an officer who accompanied her look such observations as he could.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>He had an unobstructed view of the river <unclear></unclear> miles, and a very good <num value="1">one</num> of the site of the <num value="40">forty</num> and he confesses himself unable to see any signs of life in either.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>Later in the day the <name>Kennett</name> dropped down again, and after remaining a short time was visited by <num value="2">two</num> rebel togs, on which the prisoners were placed and sent on their way. I do not assent that <persName n="Pillow,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00101" reg="mostcommon:Pillow,nomatch:0"><surname>Pillow</surname></persName> is vacated, but simply give the impressions of many persons in the <unclear></unclear> whose opinions are <unclear> titled</unclear> to consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>When our advance is made (and it cannot be delay revery long) we may find the rebels still in position, and as well prepared to dispute our passage down the river as ever. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/> The plans of this expedition, I have every reason to believe, have recently been changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>Had the flotilla been attended by a co-operating lend force, no <num value="1">one</num> supposes, not withstanding the submerged condition of the country that been passed in comparative <unclear> dieue </unclear> us they have been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>No doubt was entertained that the enemy would he routed from that point, and in that event they would be compelled in at add-on <persName n="Pillow,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00104" reg="mostcommon:Pillow,nomatch:0"><surname>Pillow</surname></persName>, leaving our way to blemphia clear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>Where <num value="1">one</num> battle could be made to serve the purpose of <num value="2">two</num>, sound judgment dictated that the fulfill should await the issue of the <rs>Corinth</rs> a juggle, and in the meantime maintain a strict blockade of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>It is now apparent however, that <persName n="Halleck,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00105" reg="mostcommon:Halleck,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Halleck</surname></persName> is in no great hurry to bring on an engagement believing that the enemy must suffer more from delay than he will, and <persName n="Davis,Flag-Officer,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00106" reg="nearbymention:Davis,J.,B.,,"><roleName n="Flag-Officer">Flag Officer</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> has therefore determined to await his movements no longer, feeling that the occupation of <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName> is his legitimate work, and that the possession of that city by our forces would have a demoralizing effect upon the rebel achy at <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/> The most engorging of the many signs of an advance in this quarter is the arrival of <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> regiments of troops, which, with those previously here, will form a anfliciantly large co-operative force to justify the flotilla in assuming the offensive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>These road were drawn from <placeName reg="Columbus, Muscogee, Georgia" key="tgn,7013643">Columbus</placeName>, <persName n="Hickman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00107" reg="mostcommon:Hickman,nomatch:0"><surname>Hickman</surname></persName>, Island No Ton, and New Madrid, and are hardy, well seasoned troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>Heartily tired of the garrison duty they have been performing for some time past, they are rejoiced at the prospect of seeing active service once mere. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/> Another indication is the arrived of half-a dozen rams from above.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>When the rebels mine, you know we must countermine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>They have given us several expensive <unclear></unclear> in the art of <hi rend="italics">butting</hi> since the war began, and it is high time we had learned something.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>Their prows have been strengthened and sheathed with iron, and bulwarks of heavy timber constructed upon their main decks, reaching nearly up to the hurricanes roofs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>There can be no doubt that, if not interfered with, these rams would give an enemy's cenacle some very uncomfortable thus us; but what resistance their bulwarks will offer to a <measure n="64l." type="pounds"><num value="64">sixty-four</num> pound</measure> baliremains to be seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>I concess I should not fancy a seat behind them in such an event. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/> Government, I believe, has not yet taken any stock in these odd looking implements of naval warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>They are the result of individual and State enterprise, <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName> having furnished most of them, with the understanding that if, on trial, they prove to be effective, the <rs>General Government</rs> was to become their purchaser.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/>Just now the probability of their soon having an opportunity to test their powers stems very good indeed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/> While upon the subject of rams, it may not be improper to say that since the late naval engagement, rafts of timber have been ocustracted around our gunboats to protect them from the attacks of the enemy's <q>&#x0022;butters.&#x0022;</q>--This is called <q>&#x0022;booming, &#x0022;</q> and is believed to be a sure preventive of the recurrence of such a disaster as met the <rs>Cincinnati</rs> last <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct> week. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/> After <measure n="8days" type="date">eight days</measure> silence, the bombardment of <placeName key="tgn,6002083" n="1.000 95" reg="fort pillow, lauderdale, tennessee">Fort Pillow</placeName> was ordered to be resumed yesterday morning; but just as the mortars were about to drop to their position, a flag of truce from the enemy came round the point, and a large portion of the day was consumed in negotiations &mdash; of what character has not yet transpired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>Toward evening, how ever, the enemy's flag withdrew, and then the mortars once more resumed their work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>If this bombarding the enemy were the only evidence of active operations, I should despair of anything ever being accomplished, for I have long since come to the conclusion that mortar-firing is a very harmless amusement </p> </div4> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="166"/> Our contemporaries, both of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> press and our own, seem to be much exercised on this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="168"/>A gentleman who returned from the <rs type="place">Valley</rs> a few days ago, reports him at <placeName reg="Strasburg, Shenandoah, Virginia" key="tgn,7014550">Strasburg</placeName> about the beginning of the present week; but who can tell where he may, be now?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>His movement are so rapid, that it is almost impossible to keep up with him. But of <num value="1">one</num> thing we may feel assured, and that is that he is in the very place where he ought to be, let that place be what it may. The <orgName n="Lynchburg Republican" type="newspaper">Lynchburg Republican</orgName> says that at last accounts the enemy seemed to be gathering around him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>Before these several enemies can effect anything of consequence, they must be united.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>At present they are widely separated, and he is in a central position, if he be at <placeName reg="Strasburg, Shenandoah, Virginia" key="tgn,7014550">Strasburg</placeName>, which seems to be the better opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>Whether he will allow them to unite or not. remains to be seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>Judging from the style of his tactics heretofore, we should judge they would find it a very difficult matter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>He is not the man, we take it, to miss an opportunity of attacking his foes in detail, when it presents itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>His activity is proverbial, and keeping his forces together, or so nearly together that they can be united in a few hours, it is part of his system to fall <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> upon <num value="1">one</num> detachment, then on another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>He adheres in the old Napoleonic method of carrying on war, and apparently sees no advantage in allowing an enemy's whole strength to be united before attacking him. He has none of that chivalry which has distinguished other <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> in this war, and which does not allow an enemy to be assailed, until be shall have brought up every man and every gun and fortified his camp so us to render it almost impregnable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/> For these reasons we have no fears for old <persName><foreName>Stonewall</foreName></persName>, nor can all the bravado of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and the threats in which they indulge so profusely, induce us to believe that he has run, or is about to run, into any danger from which he will not be able to extricate himself with glory to his army and advantage to his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>We know of no man who may be left so entirely to his own devices without apprehension on the part of his friends.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>If the enemy come with inferior forces, he will capture the whole of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>If they come with numbers anything like equal, he will beat them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>If they be greatly superior in strength, he will get away from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>Under no circumstances will he sit down and throw up dirt, allowing them to surround him at leisure, and shell him out of his camp when he shall have been completely enveloped.
