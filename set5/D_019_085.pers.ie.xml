<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>But this did not last long, the <rs>Lexington</rs> coming up and taking the second place, about half way round, and keeping it to the turn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>The struggle for the mile was not great, apparently, but Planet <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> passed the string, getting the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> mile, (time, <measure n="2minutes" type="date">two minutes</measure>,) next to him was Panic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>On the back stretch, on the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> mile, Planet took the track and maintained it. Lightning then went ahead, the <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginian</rs> following.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>At the home stretch Lightning was some lengths ahead.--Planet, who had been gaining on him, from the <num value="3">three</num>-quarter posts, made a valiant effort to reach him, taking the dry outside of the track and looking all the way down very formidable, but there was a good length of day-light between him and Lightning at the string, which the latter passed, amidst the shouts of the spectators, winning the mile in <time value="2:06">2:06</time>, and the heat in <time value="8:02">8:02</time>, which, all things considered, may be reckoned goodish time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>And in this order, or nearly so, they went round, till having passed the home turn Planet, who seemed to have been waiting a little, gathered, but did not reach his opponent, who passed the string a length ahead, making the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> mile in <num value="2:07.5">2:07&#x00BD;</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>Still he kept ahead, extending his distance for a while, but about <num value="3">three</num> quarters round Planet came up a little, but was not much closer than before to Lightning on passing the string.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>This <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> mile was run in <num value="2:02.5">2:02&#x00BD;</num>, (the <num value="2">two</num> in <time value="4:10">4:10</time>.) Planet, on entering the back stretch, made an attempt to reach his precursor, but &#x0022;couldn't come it.&#x0022; --Lightning ran a way from him as if it was the easiest thing in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>But the <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginian</rs> kept gallantly on, and in rounding the homestretch made another valorous attempt, but without success, the advantage of Lightning at the string being about the same as before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>On the back stretch Planet made another ineffectual brush.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>Half way round he neared his leader, and made a pretty run to catch him.--Turning the homestretch, they came down amidst uproarious shouts, Lightning, however, keeping some lengths ahead, and so reaching the winning post, having made the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> mile in <time value="2:02">2:02</time>, the heat in <num value="8:13.5">8:13&#x00BD;</num>, and so, of course, the race. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/>Nurses frightened cross children with it, and old men entertained their boys with long stories of the terrible partizan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>Probably no name was so greatly detested throughout the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>Cruel and remorseless, we presume he was, to a certain extent.
