<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> The suggestions above made, as to not drawing from the <name>Treasury</name> during the year the whole amount of the appropriations authorized by law, will apply to the estimates, so that, instead of the above deficiency of <measure n="3867834dollars" type="currency">$3,867,834</measure> <num value="53">53</num>, there will probably remain in the <name>Treasury</name> on the <date value="1862-07-01">1st July, 1862,</date> a balance of about <measure n="8000000dollars" type="currency">$8,000,000</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> The correctness of this estimate of expenditure for the present and next fiscal years may be illustrated in another and similar form.--The entire expenditure of the government for the fiscal year ending <date value="1860-06-10">June 10, 1860,</date> exclusive of the redemption of treasury notes, which are otherwise provided for, and the interest on the public debt, was <measure n="59848474dollars" type="currency">$59,848,474</measure> <num value="72">72</num>, and in that sum was included <measure n="4446009dollars" type="currency">$4,446,009</measure> <num value="26">26</num>, to meet a deficiency in the <orgName n="Post Office Department" type="department">Post-Office Department</orgName>, produced by the failure of the <orgName n="Post Office" type="office">post-office</orgName> appropriation bill at the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> session of the <num value="35" type="ordinal">thirty-fifth</num> Congress &mdash; thereby causing this amount to be paid and charged in the expenditure of the fiscal year ending <date value="1860-06-30">June 30, 1860,</date> though in point of fact the service was rendered and the liability incurred in the preceding year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>It should be borne in mind that the sum of <measure n="59848474dollars" type="currency">$59,848,474</measure> <num value="72">72</num>, included not only payments growing out of such appropriations as had been estimated for by the department, but all other sums appropriated by Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>There is no reason why the expenditure for the present or next fiscal year should exceed that of the last year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>Allowing, however, a margin for an increase, it may be safely stated that the expenses for the <measure n="2years" type="date">two years</measure> will not exceed <measure n="60000000dollars" type="currency">$60,000,000</measure> each &mdash; making the amount to be provided for <measure n="120000000dollars" type="currency">$120,000,000</measure> The estimated means of the treasury for the same period are, for the present fiscal year, <measure n="63348996dollars" type="currency">$63,348,996</measure> <num value="75">75</num>, and for the year ending <date value="1862-06-30">June 30, 1862,</date> <measure n="64250000dollars" type="currency">$64,250,000</measure>, which would leave an excess of estimated means over estimated expenditure of <measure n="7598996dollars" type="currency">$7,598,996</measure> <num value="75">75</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> The estimate of receipts into the treasury have been made without reference to the financial and commercial panic, which has assumed so threatening an aspect within the last few days, and of which I shall speak more fully hereafter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The country was never in a more prosperous condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Our planters and farmers have been blest, as a general rule, with abundant crops, and were realizing remunerative prices for all kinds of products.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>The exports of the last fiscal year had reached the enormous sum of <measure n="400122296dollars" type="currency">$400,122,296</measure>, and the imports for the same period were <measure n="362163911dollars" type="currency">$362,163,911</measure>, yielding a revenue from customs of <measure n="53187511.87dollars" type="currency">$53,187,511.87</measure>. The exports of domestic produce for the present fiscal year, as far as they have been received, indicate an increase fully equal, if not greater, than that of preceding years, thus authorizing the estimate of increased revenue from that source.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Apart, therefore, from the threatened embarrassments in the trade and business of the country, these estimates, both of expenditure and receipts, would be submitted to Congress with great confidence that they would not vary very far from the actual results. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> It is impossible to anticipate the effects which this threatened revulsion will produce upon the business of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The absence of all the ordinary causes for such a state of things leaves no data upon which to make calculations &mdash; all the elements of prosperity are in existence &mdash; abundant crops with remunerative prices, money seeking safe investments, and, indeed, everything to indicate more than the usual increase in trade and business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>The causes which have so suddenly arrested this tide of prosperity must be looked for outside of the financial and commercial operations of the country; they are of a political character, and therefore so dependent for their ultimate effect upon future developments that it is impossible, at present, to say what will be the extent of their influence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>If, as some suppose, they are merely temporary, and will soon pass away, then there will be no necessity for any action of Congress, except to provide for the embarrassments already existing in consequence of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>If, on the other hand, the effect should prove more permanent, the fact will be made manifest during the present session of Congress, and in time for such action as will provide the necessary means to carry on the operations of the government and preserve the public credit. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> Already has the treasury been seriously affected by these causes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The receipts from customs for the last few days have greatly fallen off, and the limited amount received is composed each day of an increased proportion of treasury notes not yet due. The indications are, that such will, at least for the present, continue to be the case; not only so, but in consequence of the failure of bidders for the late loan to comply with the terms of their bids, a portion of the ordinary revenues has been withdrawn from the ordinary sources of expenditure to meet the payment of treasury notes past due, and the interest thereon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>This condition of things demands the immediate attention of Congress, and its early action will be required to enable the department to carry on the operations of the government, and at the same time preserve unimpaired the public credit. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> The permanent public debt on <date value="1860-06-30">June 30, 1860,</date> </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> was <measure n="45079203dollars" type="currency">$45,079,203</measure> <num value="08">08</num>, and the outstanding treasury notes at that date amounted to <measure n="19690500dollars" type="currency">$19,690,500</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> By the act of <date value="1860-06-22">June 22, 1860,</date> provision was made for the redemption of treasury notes and payment of the interest thereon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>This act provided for the issuing of stock for an amount not exceeding <measure n="21000000dollars" type="currency">$21,000,000</measure>, at a rate of interest <q>&#x0022;not exceeding <num value="0.06">6 per centum</num> per annum, and to be reimbursed within a period not beyond <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> and not less than <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure>.&#x0022;</q> It was the policy of the department to negotiate this loan for such amounts and at such times as would place the money in the treasury to meet these treasury notes as they should fall due. To have negotiated the whole amount thereof, or any portion in advance, as the notes falling due, would have subjected the government to the unnecessary payment of interest during the time the money would have remained in the vaults of the treasury uncalled for. There was no power in the department to call in the treasury notes until they became due. Besides, the withdrawal of such an amount of specie from the public would have been attended with the most injurious effects upon the financial operations of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>For these reasons, no negotiation of any portion of the loan was attempted until the <date value="1860-09-08">8th day of September, 1860,</date> when proposals were invited for <num value="10000000">ten millions</num> of the loan, which was ample to meet all the treasury notes that would fall due before <date value="1861-01-01">January 1, 1861.</date>--The rate of interest was fixed at <num value="0.05">five per centum</num> per annum, under the conviction that the loan could be readily negotiated at that rate, for at that time the <num value="0.05">five per cent</num> stock of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> was selling in the market at a premium of <num value="0.03">three per cent.</num> The result realized this just expectation, and the whole amount offered was taken either at par or a small premium.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Before, however, the time had arrived, for payment on the part of the bidders, the financial crisis, to which I have already referred, came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Some of the bidders promptly complied with their proposals, and others were willing to do so, if required by the <name>Department</name>, though it would be at a considerable sacrifice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>Under these circumstances, an additional term of <measure n="30days" type="date">thirty days</measure> was given to all bidders who would deposit <num value="0.5">one-half</num> of the amount of their bids within the time originally prescribed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Most of the bidders availed themselves of this extension, and made their deposits accordingly on or before the <date value="1860-11-22">22d November, 1860.</date> A portion, however, failed to do so, and to them the additional <measure n="30days" type="date">thirty days</measure> has been offered, on condition that they would increase their forfeit deposit of <num value="0.01">one per cent</num>, to <num value="0.05">five per cent.</num> To this proposition no response has as yet been received.--The amount of the loan awarded to this last class of bidders is <measure n="1099000dollars" type="currency">$1,099,000</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> The question presents itself, what action shall be taken in reference to the stock which may be thus forfeited?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>There is no power in the department, as the law now stands, to meet the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>It is recommended that Congress should immediately authorize the department to dispose of this stock upon the best possible terms, holding the defaulting bidders responsible for the difference between their bids and the amount for which the stock can now be negotiated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>The necessities of the <name>Treasury</name> demand prompt action on this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Not only are the treasury notes past due rapidly coming in for redemption, but, as already stated, those not due are being paid in for customs, thereby withdrawing from the regular operation of the government its principal source of revenue. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/> To meet the remaining outstanding treasury notes and interest thereon there is yet to be negotiated <num value="11000000">eleven millions</num> of the stock authorized by the act of <date value="1860-06-22">June 22, 1860.</date> The statement just made of the difficulties attending the payment for the stock already sold, in connection with the fact that capitalists, in the present condition of the country, seem unwilling to invest in <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> stock at par, renders it almost certain that this remaining <num value="11000000">eleven millions</num> can not now be negotiated upon terms acceptable to the government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The condition of the <name>Treasury</name> is such that no serious delay can be indulged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>I recommend, therefore, a repeal of so much of the act of <date value="1860-06-22">June 22, 1860, </date> as authorizes the issuing of this additional <num value="11000000">eleven millions</num> of stock, and that authority be given for the issuing of treasury notes to the same amount, to be negotiated at such rates as will command the confidence of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>To create that confidence, I recommend that the public lands be unconditionally pledged for the ultimate redemption of all the treasury notes which it may become necessary to issue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>I make this recommendation of substituting treasury notes for stock, the more readily from the conviction that there should always exist in the department power to issue treasury notes for a limited amount, under the direction of the <rs>President</rs>, to meet unforeseen contingencies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>It is a power which can never be abused, as the amount realized from such source can only be used to meet lawful demands upon the <name>Treasury</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>No, <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of the Treasury">Secretary of the Treasury</rs> or <rs type="role2">President</rs> would ever exercise it, except compelled to do so by the exigencies of the public service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>On the other hand, it would enable the government to meet, without embarrassment, those sudden revulsions to which the country is always liable, and which cannot always be anticipated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/> I have already stated that provision should be made at once to relieve the treasury from its present embarrassments, produced by the causes referred to. To do this, Congress should authorize the issuing of an additional amount of treasury notes, not less than <num value="10000000">ten millions</num> of dollars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>With these means the department will be enabled to meet all lawful demands upon it for the present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>The extent of the financial crisis through which the country is now passing cannot now be determined, and until it is better known, no policy can be recommended of a permanent character. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> No change in the revenue laws can be made in time to meet these difficulties; and if it could, the same causes would produce the same results under any laws that might be passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>If Congress, however, should determine upon such a policy &mdash; either with a view to meet existing difficulties or for the purpose of providing for the payment of any portion of the public debt &mdash; I can only refer them, for the views of the <name>Department</name>, to my former reports on that subject. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1734"/> We had quite a considerable fall of snow in this region last night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1735"/>When I awoke this morning, the ground looked as though it had been freshly sown with salt, (mind, I do not say sown with fresh salt,) or powdered white sugar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1736"/>I apprehended a severe spell and a freeze upon the back of it. But the clerk of the weather seems to have been satisfied with giving us a specimen of what he can do when the fancy takes him, and has let us off with a very moderate proof of his ability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1737"/>At present the sun is shining in unclouded glory, and not a vestige remains of the last night's sprinkle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1738"/>The air is soft and balmy, and the day would do no discredit to the prescriptive beauty of <dateStruct value="-05-"><month reg="05">May</month></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1739"/>I recollect that on this day <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> ago, the <name>Howitzers</name> (who, by-the-bye, wore the red shirt before <persName n="Garibaldi,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00984" reg="mostcommon:Garibaldi,nomatch:0"><surname>Garibaldi</surname></persName> thought of adopting it, and from whom, no doubt, instead of the firemen, he borrowed the idea,) broke up from their encampment in <placeName reg="Charles Town, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,2117756">Charlestown</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1740"/>I recollect &mdash; and shall always recollect &mdash; with great distinctness, the events of that day, which restored us <hi rend="italics">war-worn</hi> veterans to the peace and comfort of our own firesides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1741"/>Never shall I forget the long muskets and the long bayonets that we bore with us on our triumphant return.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1742"/>Indeed, I may say that my memory on that subject is a memory of feeling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1743"/>We had occasion to fire but once, and then it was at a hill-side, not at an enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1744"/>I have no doubt if an enemy had been before us, our guns would have hurt him badly; at least, if they did not, they would have let him off more easily than they did a great many of us. But alas!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1745"/>for war and glory! &#x0022;Othello's occupation's gone.&#x0022; I have nothing more to relate of </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1746"/> --&#x0022;Hairbreadth'scapes </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1747"/> And moving accidents by flood and field.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1748"/> Therefore, since your readers delight in things which smack of gunpowder, let me return to war's <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> cousin, hunting. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1749"/> It seems that your report of the abundance of game throughout the country, or some other cause equally moving, started off more than <num value="1">one</num> <persName><foreName>Nimrod</foreName></persName> to the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1750"/>Several of these are now staying at the house of a gentleman within sight of the spot where I now sit.--They took the field in great force yesterday morning, in company with a young gentleman of the medical profession, who professes likewise to be no small adept at bringing down game in full career.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1751"/>I have not learned what success they met with, but I heard <num value="1">one</num> most awful big gun!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1752"/>They must have been shooting at an elephant!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1753"/>So much powder could not have been burnt upon a beast of less imposing magnitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1754"/>I expect to hear great tidings before the day is out. I mean to come in, if possible, for a part of the ivory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1755"/><num value="1">One</num> of these gentlemen Nimrods is a particular friend of mine, who holds an office in the <orgName n="State Library" type="library">State Library</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1756"/>It is very seldom that he takes the field, I believe, and, no doubt, he meant that big gun for a holiday salvo, for I suspect it was he that fired it. I am dying of curiosity to know what he shot.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1757"/><num value="2">Two</num> of the others were relatives of his, and have the reputation of being considerable marksmen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1758"/>I wish them plenty of game, good dogs, guns that never miss fire, and an unerring aim. Whether any of this good fortune befall them, or whether they miss of it all, we should think that an excursion of the kind, after long attention to business, must be a most delightful recreation to a man who is fond of a dog and a gun. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1759"/> The snow this morning cut short a projected <rs n="Fox" type="nativeamerican">fox</rs> chase, in which <num value="2">two</num> young ladies were expected to join.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1760"/>Is it not a pity that such recreations are not pursued more steadily by our young country women ? Nothing is more invigorating, or more exhilarating, than active exercise on horseback.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1761"/>Nor is there a more graceful accomplishment, in the long catalogue of things that much become a woman, than perfect horsemanship.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1762"/>Of course, it is not expected that a young lady should leap a ditch, or clear a fence, like a veteran <rs n="Fox" type="nativeamerican">fox</rs> hunter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1763"/>Indeed, there is very little of that sort of exercise required, even of the most expert horseman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1764"/>But the excitement of the chase, the galloping motion of the horses, the cry of the hounds, the shouts of the hunters, are all calculated to make the blood circulate rapidly, to bring health to the frame, bloom to the cheeks, and brightness to the eye. It is not at all necessary, I apprehend, that exercise of this kind should be associated with a masculine character, or with the least want of refinement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1765"/>On the contrary, it is healthful, innocent, and full of grace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1766"/>It is especially suited to the young, and youth is so decidedly the season of enjoyment that those who do not enjoy themselves in youth will be apt to pass through life without enjoying themselves at all. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1767"/> There have been <num value="3">three</num> revolutions in <rs n="Fox" type="nativeamerican">foxes</rs>, and the dogs that chase them, within my recollection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1768"/>When I <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> remember there were none but grey <rs n="Fox" type="nativeamerican">foxes</rs> in all these parts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1769"/>They are much smaller, much weaker, and much shorter of wind than the red <rs n="Fox" type="nativeamerican">foxes</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1770"/>The hounds that were used for chasing them were slow-footed animals, very sure upon the trail, with most sonorous throats.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1771"/>Some of them had voices like the sound of the great bell at <placeName reg="Moscow, Fayette, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100492">Moscow</placeName>, or rather like what I suppose it must have been &mdash; others like the bell at the barracks &mdash; others like the little silver bells that you keep on the table.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1772"/>Altogether, the chime was delightful when the cry was up and the chase in view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1773"/>For hours would they toil after the game, making the woods re-echo to their music.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1774"/>The hounds of <persName n="Theseus,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00985" reg="mostcommon:Theseus,nomatch:0"><surname>Theseus</surname></persName>, as described by <persName n="Shakespeare,,,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00986" reg="mostcommon:Shakespeare,nomatch:0"><surname>Shakespeare</surname></persName>, who was himself a keen sportsman, must have been like these: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1775"/> &#x0022;Now in pursuit, but matched in mouths like bells, </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1776"/> Each under each; a cry more tunable </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1777"/> Was never hallowed to or cheered with horn, </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1778"/> In <placeName key="tgn,7012056" n="1.000 1" reg="kriti">Crete</placeName>, in <placeName reg="Sparta, White, Tennessee" key="tgn,2101606">Sparta</placeName>, nor in Thessaly.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1779"/> In the course of time a revolution took place among the <rs>Northern</rs> hordes of <rs n="Fox" type="nativeamerican">foxes</rs>.--The red <rs n="Fox" type="nativeamerican">foxes</rs>, like the <rs n="Scythian" type="ethnic">Scythians</rs> of the olden time, or the hordes that overran the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> empire in the <rs>Middle Ages</rs>, were driven from their habitations by superior power, and they came down upon the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1780"/>The grey <rs n="Fox" type="nativeamerican">fox</rs> quickly disappeared, and the red <rs n="Fox" type="nativeamerican">fox</rs> usurped his patrimony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1781"/>With the grey <rs n="Fox" type="nativeamerican">fox</rs> disappeared the slow, deep-toned, loud-mouthed hound, and a new race, very swift in pursuit, but entirely wanting the musical gifts of their predecessors, came into vogue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1782"/>Very different was the red <rs n="Fox" type="nativeamerican">fox</rs>, from the rival whom he had dispossessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1783"/>It was extremely difficult to catch; indeed, we believe he was seldom ever caught upon the ground.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1784"/>Late in the season, about <dateStruct value="-02-"><month reg="02">February</month></dateStruct> or the early part of <dateStruct value="-03-"><month reg="03">March</month></dateStruct>, he would run a pack of hounds all day. In our boyhood, we well remember an old stager, who had a white tip on the end of his tail, and was thence called silver tail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1785"/>This <rs n="Fox" type="nativeamerican">fox</rs> became so well known, that the hunters would call off their dogs when they found they were in pursuit of him. He knew the sound of the horn as well as the hunter did, and as soon as he heard the latter blowing up his dogs preparatory to a start for home, he was up and off over the hills, like a streak of lightning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1786"/>He never could be taken napping.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1787"/>It was said that on <num value="1">one</num> occasion, he led a pack of hounds from a point about half a mile above the present residence of <persName n="Trent,Doctor,Reynolds,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00987" reg="default:Trent,Reynolds,,,"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <foreName>Reynolds</foreName> <surname>Trent</surname></persName>, to <placeName reg="Bolling's Island">Bolling's Island</placeName>, a distance of at least <measure n="15miles" type="distance">fifteen miles</measure> as the crow flies, and that he camped at night within a few <measure n="100yards" type="distance">hundred yards</measure> of the spot whence he started in the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1788"/>On that famous day, he broke down every horse, and threw every dog out of the chase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1789"/>Several hunters, at different times, reported that they had captured old &#x0022;silver tail,&#x0022; but he was like <persName n="Barleycorn,,John,,," id="n-0001.0001.00000.00988" reg="default:Barleycorn,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Barleycorn</surname></persName>, up again as soon as the next pack came along.--The hunters were deceived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1790"/>There were other Richmonds in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1791"/>They took, no doubt, <rs n="Fox" type="nativeamerican">foxes</rs> with tips on the ends of their tails, but not the genuine Simon Pure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="1792"/>He, we doubt not, died at a good old age, with all his children and grandchildren &mdash; at least all the hunters had spared &mdash; gathered around him, and mourning their irreparable loss. P. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
