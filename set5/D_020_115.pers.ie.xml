<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>I have endeavored to show, in the first place, that those man cannot be convicted of piracy, because they had not the intent to steal essential to the commission of that offence, and that you are the judges whether that intent did or did not exist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>In this connexion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>I hold it to be immaterial whether the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> was <num value="1">one</num> of right, established on sufficient authority according to the laws of nations, and to be recognized as such, or whether it was merely a Government in fact.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Now, then, we claim, beyond all that, and apart from the question of Government in law or Government in fact, that there exists a state of civil war which entitles those defendants to be treated in every other manner than as pirates, which may have rendered them amenable to the danger of being regarded as prisoners of war, but which has made it impossible for them to be ever dealt with as fulous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>Now, I am sorry that it has become necessary in this discussion to open questions for debate, any inquiry about which at this particular juncture in our history is not likely to be attended with any great advantage.--But, like my brethren for the defence, I have endeavored to state freely, fearlessly, frankly, and correctly the positions on which the defendants have a right to rely before the <rs type="place">Court</rs> and before you.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/> <hi rend="italics">Editors Dispatch</hi>--Gentlemen; The subject of <rs type="role2">Chaplain</rs>, and their pay, seems to have created sufficient interest with a certain portion of the newspaper writers as to give rise to an attack, in some instances, upon the office itself, or some <num value="1">one</num> of its incumbents. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/> Without pausing to criticise the spirit or the tone of the article on Chaplains which appeared in the <hi rend="italics">Dispatch</hi> of <dateStruct><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct>, or to say that the <name>Chaplains</name> are paid too much, or too little &mdash; or that there is no necessity for this branch of the army, or post service, and therefore no recognition of <name n="God" type="God">God</name> necessary in the recognition of men appointed to minister in camp or hospitals, unless they can afford to be without any support &mdash; I would venture to advise a &#x0022;<rs type="role2">Chaplain</rs> without Pay&#x0022; that, while he may be himself able to render the service he claims to have done &#x0022;without pay,&#x0022;, notwithstanding he has &#x0022;no salary from any source,&#x0022; that perhaps others who have made quite as many sacrifices as himself, but who may not be quite as willing to act the part of trumpeter, as well as <rs type="role2">Chaplain</rs>, require at least that all the sacrifice should not be on their side. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/> The &#x0022;<rs type="role2">Chaplain</rs> without Pay&#x0022; deserves and should receive the congratulations of his friends and the public, that his finances are so plethoric that he can live &#x0022;with no salary from any source,&#x0022; and has officiated willingly in his ministerial office at the hospitals without pay, whenever called upon, &#x0026;c. <dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct> his shadow never grow less; but unless he is a good financier, as well as an unpaid man in every department in which he is engaged, he will never &#x0022;lard the lean earth&#x0022; with superfluous fat. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/> When he says, however, that &#x0022;there is no necessity for any paid <rs type="role2">Chaplain</rs> for this city, &#x0022; he simply states what is not so. With all the aid that the noble hearted clergy of all the denominations so generously rendered, still they have their other and more special duties which press upon them, and the paid <rs>Chaplain</rs>, with all the efforts of these good men in assisting them, can scarcely accomplish the object of their appointment. </p>
