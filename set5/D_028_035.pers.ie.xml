<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/>To Arm and Equip an Additional force of cavalry, there is need of Carbines, Revolvers, Pistols, Saddles and other accoutrements of mounted men. Arms and equipments of the kind desired are believed to he held by citizens in sufficient numbers to supply our wants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>Many keep them as trophies, and some with the expectation of using them in their own defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/>But it should be remembered that arms are now required for use, and that they cannot be made so effectual for the defence of the country in any way as in the hands of organized troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>They are needed to enable our cavalry to cope with the well-armed and equipped cavalry of the enemy, not only in the <rs n="General Service" type="misc">general service</rs>, but in resisting those predatory expeditions which have inflicted so much loss upon the people of the interior. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>To the patriotic I need make no other appeal than the wants of the service, but I beg to remind those who are reluctant to part with the arms and equipments in their possession, that by keeping them they diminish the ability of the army to defend their property, without themselves deriving any benefit from them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>I therefore urge all persons not in the service to deliver promptly, to some of the officers designated below, such arms and equipments (especially those suitable for cavalry) as they may have, and to report to those officers the names of such persons as neglect to surrender those in their possession. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> Every citizen who prevents a carbine or pistol from remaining unused will render a service to his country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>Those who think to retain arm for their own defence should remember that if the army cannot protect them the arms will be of little use.--While no valid title can be acquired to public arms and equipments, except from the <rs>Government</rs>, it is reported that many persons have ignorantly purchased them from private parties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>A fair compensation will, therefore, be made to all who deliver such arms and equipments to any ordnance officer, officer commanding at a post, officers and agents of the <rs>Quartermaster</rs> and Commissary Departments at any station, or officers in the enrolling service, or connected with the <rs type="place">Nitre and Mining Bureau</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>All these officers are requested, and those connected with this army are directed, to receive and receipt for all arms and equipments, whatever their condition, and forward the same, with a duplicate receipt, to the <orgName n="Ordnance Department" type="department">Ordnance Department</orgName> at <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 7" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, and report their proceedings to these headquarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The person holding the receipt will be compensated upon presenting it to the <orgName n="Ordnance Bureau" type="bureau">Ordnance Bureau</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> While it is hoped that no <num value="1">one</num> will disregard this appeal, all officers connected with this army are required, and all others are requested, to take possession of any public arms and equipments they may and in the hands of persons unwilling to surrender them to the service of the country, and to give receipt therefore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>A reasonable allowance for their expenses and trouble will be made to such patriotic citizens as will collect and deliver to any of the officers above designated such arms and equipments as they may find in the hands of persons not in service, or who will report the same to those officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>A prompt compliance with the call will greatly promote the efficiency and strength of the army, particularly of the cavalry, and render it better able to protect the homes and property of the people from outrage. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> In another column will be found the proceedings of the grandest assemblages that ever convened on <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> soil.--Never before, since the beginning of this war, has there been anything approaching the fiery and universal enthusiasm of those vast and august assemblages.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The fervid patriotism displayed at the beginning of the war, compared with the profound and powerful passion that blazed in the sea of upturned human faces yesterday, and thundered in their responsive shouts to the speeches of the orators, was only the harmless play of the summer lightning to the glare and crash of the tropic storm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>We could only wish that the minions of the <rs>Washington</rs> despotism had been present to see and hear the answer of a great people to the demand for unconditional surrender of liberty, property and honor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The meetings yesterday, enthusiastic as they were, presented but a faint type of the deep and powerful feelings which now animate every Southern heart.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>No cloud now overshadows the future.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>The awakened and tremendous energies of the nation need henceforth but a skillful direction, and its best talents to be placed at the head of its armies, and, under the blessing of Heaven, our Independence is secure. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>It is true that some of all of them were destroyed, but then the inhabitants allege that it was done by straggling parties; nor did I meet <num value="1">one</num> person who thought that any commanding officer was a party to the arson; but to the contrary, every citizen who asked, on the approach of the army, for protection, was furnished with a guard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Neither did the enemy destroy all the provisions in the country, but left a plenty for a year's subsistence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>I heard of no man in a distance of some <measure n="40miles" type="distance">forty miles</measure> who had everything taken from him. It is true they helped themselves to horses, mules and provisions as they needed them, taking away a large number of hogs and kine, but in no instance was a family left destitute and totally in want.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>But few negroes were taken off, comparatively, and but few of these were compelled to go; some of which have been permitted to return, and so loose were they in their discipline, that many have run away and returned to their masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The above statement accords with what I have heard in reference to other sections of the country through which <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> passed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>In connection with this statement, and what we daily hear from <placeName reg="Savannah, Chatham, Georgia" key="tgn,7014487">Savannah</placeName>, is it not reasonable to suppose that <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> has inaugurated a new policy &mdash; that of leniency to the people, in order to win them back to the <rs>Union</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>If not so, it is certainly a great relief to have an enemy who is so different to many others, who is possessed of manliness, generosity and humanity, insomuch as to respect the helplessness of those in his power, and to extend such protection to suffering humanity as to prevent total destitution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Another fact it may be worth the while to state, which is: upon inquiry, I found no <num value="1">one</num>'who heard <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> or any other high official say <q>&#x0022;that in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> he could restrain his men, but in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> he could nor would not.&#x0022;</q> It is true, this remark was made frequently, but always by the common soldiery and a few captains, who were, if possible, a little meaner than the stragglers who did the injury to dwellings, &#x0026;c. I am forced to the conviction that even if <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> is ever so unfortunate as to be overrun by the enemy that <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> and his commanding officers will show the same leniency as he did in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>And if he fails to create a Union feeling in the country &mdash; if, by his present course, it is his object to do, and in which he has failed in <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>--still I do not believe the people of <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> need apprehend any more damage to them by the enemy than what the citizens of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> have already suffered.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="Sherman"></bibl></cit>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/> Having called you to order, it is proper that I should explain the object and purpose of this meeting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>We stand here to consider the most momentous public issue that ever agitated a nation. --<num value="1">One</num> in which is involved the very life and being of a people, the existence of their laws and government, their life, liberty and honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>Whatever is sacred in human affections, or- dear to the hearts of men, is involved in this countess; and may <name n="God" type="God">God</name> grant us the wisdom to devise, and the power to execute, those measures which, under His hand, shall effect our deliverance in this great crisis of our affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>We are not responsible for the lives that have been given up in this contest, and our skirts are clear of the blood which has been shed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>We entered it to maintain the rights of self-government.--a right which should have been as dear to our enemies as to us. It is a great <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> idea &mdash; the growth of <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> soil &mdash; and should, in their eyes, be as sacred as it is to us. For <num value="4">four</num> long years we have been engaged in a war, the like of which has not been seen in modern times; the only approximations to which were the wars of <persName n="Wallenstein,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00070" reg="mostcommon:Wallenstein,nomatch:0"><surname>Wallenstein</surname></persName> and <persName n="Attila,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00071" reg="mostcommon:Attila,nomatch:0"><surname>Attila</surname></persName> and the <measure n="30Years" type="date">Thirty Years</measure> War of <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>; and now, after these years of waste and destruction, we have been lately informed by the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> that there can be no peace except upon the conditions of laying down our arms and absolute submission; to come in as rebels, and submit to laws confiscating our property, and awarding the death penalty to our citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>Nor is this all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>If anything more was wanting to stir the blood, it was furnished when we were told that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> could not consent to entertain any proposition coming from us as a people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/>That Government which makes treaties with the meanest and weakest of nations, tells us &mdash; a nation of <num value="7000000">seven millions</num> of men, with arms in their hands,--that it cannot entertain any proposition coming from rebels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>Even upon the theory that we were rebels, upon what authority could they refuse to treat with us?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>There has been no civil war of any magnitude which has not been terminated by treating.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>It has been a habit with all strong governments, after a war is over, and after it has vindicated its power, to render the future as little gloomy, and its yoke as easy to its subjects, as possible; but nothing of this sort comes from the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>Nothing comes from it to soothe our feelings, nothing to alleviate the terms of a settlement, if it were possible for such a settlement to be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/>But, fellow-citizens, I will not attempt now to draw a picture of subjugation which must loom up before the eyes of every man who considers it. It would require a pencil dipped in blood to paint its gloom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>I pass this to the question of what is to become of the slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>We know that in large districts of our country the men have been taken away by them and women left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>Who is to support them ! Under our system they were provided for and happy; under their system they must perish.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>That system will destroy the whole negro race in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>In the fierce competition for food between the white and the negro, the latter will be blasted like human life before the burning sirocco, and vanish like the mist before the sun. We drew the sword not for ourselves alone, but also for his sake, and the world, which stands coldly looking on, will find that the men whom they have excluded from their sympathy are the hope of the black race.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>It was the exclamation of a celebrated <name>French</name> woman, &#x0022;Oh, Liberty, what crimes are committed in thy name !&#x0022; and we may parody by exclaiming, Oh, Philanthropy, how much misery is caused in thy name ! Well may the negro rise up and pronounce judgment against it. Fellow-citizens, I have presented the future we are to endure if we are reduced to submission. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/> I turn now to what we are to gain with our success &mdash; Independence, Liberty, our women and children &mdash; everything dear to man.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>I venture to say that there was never such a contest, and never such glory, as we may win from it. We have the world against us. It has been said that its parallel may be found in the <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> Republic; but they had the sea open to them and the <rs>French</rs> and <rs>English</rs> as allies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>We stand alone, presenting the spectacle of a brave people, contesting, foot by foot, with double their numbers; excluded, commercially and sentimentally, from the world. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/> With our success we shall establish a system of government that shall challenge the respect of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>We shall solve the problem of the extension of the <rs n="Anglo-Saxon" type="group">Anglo-Saxon</rs> race to the country south of us, and show that the white and the black races may be extended together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>Then shall the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldier return from the field, his sword dripping, and his brow crowned with laurels, a hero, whom after ages will venerate, and who will be an example to generations to come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>Are not these considerations to nerve every man to do his duty &mdash; to unite every heart and hand in the country?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>I will not hold out the delusive hope that the struggle shall be easy or the sacrifices light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>But in such interests it is better to loose life than fail. --[Great applause.] Property I throw out of consideration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>What is it to us?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>If we fail, it will be in the hands of a ruthless foe, who spares nothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>I trust and believe in the success of our cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>If our people exhibit the proper spirit, they will bring forth the deserters from their caves; and the skulker [A voice--&#x0022;Give it to 'em&#x0022;] who are avoiding the perils of the field, will go forth to share the dangers of their countrymen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>[Applause.] In war, as in religion, we must have works as well as faith.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>The man who desponds is half whipped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>[Applause.] We must have faith in the determination of our country to suffer all and do all. If we determine upon that, I do not see why we cannot win our independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>In this spirit, a French general ordered the sounding of the <name>Massellaise</name>, which changed a rout into a victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>In this spirit, the ancients consulted the bodies of their animals they sacrificed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/> Now, what are the duties of the hour?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>The now burning spirit of patriotism will become cool unless we follow it up with patriotic sacrifice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>Our duty is to give time, life itself; aye, even money; for it does seem that men love money &mdash; better than life itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>Then, it was said it was our parvise indisposition to negotiate that led to the arrogance of the invader.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>This delusion went so far that it penetrated the legislative halls, and threatened a disruption of the harmony of our councils.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>Is it wonderful that our <rs type="role2">President</rs>, whose only defect is that he is too tender-hearted, should have yielded to the temptation of trying to stop the bloodshed of his countrymen, of which every drop seemed to come from his own heart?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="346"/>The air was murky with smoke &mdash; everything was lined with cotton burning upon the leaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="347"/>The citizens did not ask to whom it belonged; the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> wanted it, and they should not have it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="348"/>With a <num value="1000">thousand</num> plausible excuses of interested selfishness, the cotton was left, in the belief that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> would give them something for it.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="424"/>It is useless to consume time by multiplying words.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="425"/>It we lose our independence, we lose all our property, of every kind, in the country &mdash; our debt, our slaves, and our lands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="426"/>But we lose more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="427"/>The people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> have a greater debt than we, and we shall not escape without being obliged to pay our proportion of their debt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="428"/>In what a condition will that leave us, with our property, our lands, bonds, houses and slaves, all gone, and the mighty debt incurred by the enemy in his war for our subjugation still to be borne, in part, by us and our children ? Then our subjugation, with all its personal evils, the utter degradation it involved, must be considered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="429"/>Subjugation &mdash; submission &mdash; presents no hope; but in continuing the war it was otherwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="430"/>We can see clearly the end and the evils of submission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="439"/>[Long-continued applause.] If we imitate the example of our sires, our success will be as glorious and triumphant as their's. So far, in this war, we have proved ourselves no degenerate sons of illustrious sires.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="498"/>Separation, he said, was a bitter pill to him; but to be compelled to go back into it again would be the bittered which could be conceived of. He adverted to the oft-repeated expressions used by some people, that it was impossible for us to be subjugated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="499"/>He thought it mischievous to say that it was impossible for us to fail, and thought it created false security to so represent our affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="500"/>For himself, he felt called upon to say that there was danger of our being subjugated and conquered; but, at the same time, we should determine to meet the issue, instead of singing hosannas over victories that had not been won and battles that had not been fought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="501"/>He thought it best for every <num value="1">one</num> to know the situation which we were in, and to consider what was to be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="502"/>There was a fearful difficulty in the dangers that beset us, and he called upon everybody to walk up boldly and fearlessly to the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="503"/>Every army was confronted by an army greatly exceeding in numbers, equipments, &#x0026;c., who were backed by a Government processing every advantage, and having access to every Power on earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="504"/>We needed men in the field; they were in the country, but not in the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="505"/>It was the fault of the people that they were not there, and not of the absent soldiers themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="506"/>Men who ought to be in the army should be made by the people to go there and do their duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="507"/>Congress had already voted every man in who was over <num value="17">seventeen</num> and under <measure n="50years" type="date">fifty years</measure> of age, with the exception of a few exemptions of certain classes, which, all told, did not exceed <num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="508"/>Leaving out preachers, doctors, and some others whose services to the country are necessary at home, every <num value="1">one</num> else of the stipulated ages ought to be in the field, and they had no business out. Congress could not do much more towards accomplishing that object; it was the duty of the people and the <rs>State Legislatures</rs> to force them in, and no man could say he was doing his duty by merely urging Congress or the <name>Legislatures</name> to do theirs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="509"/>He thought that, if the people would do more themselves, it would pay better than holding meetings and hearing speeches upon the subject of our resources.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="510"/><rs type="role2">Colonel</rs> B. thought there was plenty in the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, provided they were used economically.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="511"/>Our soldiers, he said, had nothing to eat but bread and meat, and the community at home should also endure self-denials, and live on half rations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="512"/>No man was doing his duty to his country by living sumptuously at home while the soldiers in the field were suffering for shoes and clothing; and if the people prized liberty and independence to that degree which they say they do, they should come down to the scantiest living, in order to aid our soldiers; they should be willing to live on bread and water, and wear less clothe, in order that those in the field, who are shoeless and hungry, and exposed to all the hardships mordent to camp life, might be made comfortable. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="514"/>For his part, he thought the financial history of the <rs>Government</rs> a most remarkable success.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="515"/>Without a dollar to begin with, and with everything to buy, we had engaged in this war, supplied ourselves with an abundance of ammunition and implements of warfare; had fed and clothed our soldiers, and had been enabled, up to this time, to stand up against a most powerful Government, possessing every advantage over us. But now our credit had given out and our money had given out. It was necessary to restore our currency, or Confederate credit was gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="516"/>How was that to be done?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="517"/>In order to do so every person in the country holding Confederate securities should be willing to bring them forward and burn them, thereby lightening the burthens of the <rs>Government</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="518"/>This was the spirit which ought to actuate the people; and if the <rs>Government</rs> and the people went on as they had been, we could and would be subjugated; unless something was done to bring the people up to their duty we would be overcome.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>If we would be free and independent, we must come up to the assistance of the <rs>Government</rs> and do our part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="520"/>He did not value public meetings and hurrahing speakers as much as a chew of tobacco; had often heard men say that they would rather die than be subjugated. --heard such remarks every day; but still there were a great many of that class who acted very differently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="521"/>Some had, indeed, shown a disposition to act up to that principle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="522"/>Our young men and others in the field had manifested such determination by risking their lives in the cause; but yet we needed more men to do likewise; and if we held back, contenting ourselves with simply talking about our willingness to die, until <orgName n="army"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00159" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Robert,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> wastes away from starvation and cold, dying for our country would then do no good;--the dying must be done now and living must be done now.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="529"/>We may be compelled to contract our lines, yet there was nothing discouraging in that, for was not our army in the days of the <name>Revolution</name> driven from place to place, and did they not, eventually, ragged and barefooted as they were, compel their enemies to give them peace and independence?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="530"/>He pointed to the example of <persName n="Washington,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00163" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName>, that brave and good man, who, when asked where he would go if driven out of <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, replied that he would plant his banners upon the mountains of <placeName key="tgn,2114970" n="1.000 1" reg="west augusta, augusta, virginia">West Augusta</placeName> and defy the united armies of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="531"/>The <rs>North</rs> went to war upon the abolishment of slavery; we for the maintenance of our rights; the <rs>North</rs> for conquests, we for existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="533"/>Our only alternative was to fight it out, or live slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="534"/>The speaker, in conclusion, said that he had been taught by holy writ that resistance to tyrants was obedience to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and he believed that if <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and her sister States would be true we would be victorious in the end. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="536"/>He thought the disposition of the people of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 7" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> at this time to hear speeches was the most insatiable; they were ready to give eager attention to whatever might be spoken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="537"/>After some further remarks relative to the enthusiasm which pervaded our people, the speaker then adverted to the state of feeling manifested throughout the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="538"/>He said that the scornful rejection by <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00166" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> of the humane proposition for peace, which had been offered through our commissioners, had given an evidence that day was breaking.--Since then the darkness of night had given way to the brightness of day, and he thought we should rejoice in the brilliancy of its beams.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="539"/>All the despondency should now cease, and we should go to work with renewed energy and renewed hope, determined to win our independence from such a dastardly set as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had proven themselves.--In referring to the insolent demands of submission made by <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00167" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, the speaker instanced the alacrity with which the people of the <rs>South</rs> buckled on their armor, and bade defiance to the threats and oppression of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> upon the breaking out of the <name>Revolution</name>, and desired to know if such a people as we are, who had never quailed before the <rs>British</rs> lion, should now do so before a laughing hyena.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>The victim was a vigorous man, who, <measure n="4years" type="date">four years</measure> ago, saw some remarks in a magazine about the arsenic eaters of <placeName key="tgn,7003028" n="1.000 1" reg="steiermark">Styria</placeName>, and the supposed beneficial effects of the poison upon the skin and lungs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>He commenced the practice, and from that day, though previously in good health, he became, in the language of his friends, a &#x0022;complaining man.&#x0022; Abdominal and gastric pains tormented him, but he persisted in the foolhardy experiment until a small overdose brought on all the symptoms of arsenic poisoning; and, in spite of all that could be done by the best physicians, resulted in death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>Before he died, he declared that although he had pursued the fatal practice so long and so faithfully, he was conscious of having received no benefit whatever from it. No arsenic was discovered in any of the organs, although carefully analyzed, thus showing that the doses which destroyed life must have been very minute. </p>
