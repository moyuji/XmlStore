<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/> It is a noteworthy fact that the <rs>South</rs> has never been successfully invaded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>It is also remarkable that during no attempted invasion has the negro population manifested any disposition to side with the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>During the whole of the war of <date value="1812">1812, </date> Southern territory remained untrod by hostile foot, except in hasty raids extending a few miles from the shore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>The hasty descent upon <placeName reg="District of Columbia" key="tgn,7013962">Washington city</placeName> and the march across <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName> ending in discomfiture, is the only semblance of invasion which the <rs>South</rs> suffered during the war. The brief career of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Packenham,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00069" reg="mostcommon:Packenham,nomatch:0"><surname>Packenham</surname></persName></hi> in <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, ending in his signal catastrophe at New Orleans, was but a disastrous attempt at invasion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/> During the <name>Revolution</name> the case was very little different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>Owing to the meagerness of our population, the <rs>British</rs> got possession of <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, and made successful raids into <placeName key="tgn,7007919" n="1.000 4" reg="virginia">Virginia</placeName> under <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Arnold,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00070" reg="mostcommon:Arnold,nomatch:0"><surname>Arnold</surname></persName></hi> and others, while her troops were fighting in the <name>Carolinas</name> and up-holding <hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName key="tgn,7013962" n="1.000 4" reg="district of columbia">Washington</placeName></hi> at the <rs>North</rs>; but these were but rapid plunder excursions, attended by none of the results of successful invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>The <name>British</name> campaigns in the <rs>South</rs> more nearly approached the character of such invasions than any other that the <rs>South</rs> has ever encountered; but these campaigns partook more of the nature of civil war than of foreign intrusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>Tories from all parts of the <name>Colonies</name> had in the early years of the struggle sought security in the seclusion of the <rs>Western Carolinas</rs>; and when the war was transferred to that quarter, the <hi rend="italics">invading</hi> column consisted of but a regiment or so of <name>British</name> regulars, supported by many regiments of Tories.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>But for the domestic aid which thus rallied to the <rs>British</rs> standard, history would never have had to record the important events of the <rs>Southern Revolutionary</rs> campaigns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>Despite of these campaigns, the proposition remains true that the <rs>South</rs> has never been the theatre of a successful invasion.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/> The impregnability of the <rs>South</rs> is partly owing to the climate, which makes summer campaigning as impracticable as winter; but chiefly to the large distances requiring to be traversed, to the sparseness and warlike character of the people, to the incorruptible fidelity of the slaves, and to the many large water courses lying athwart every road and highway.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>The South --such is the character of her sea-board, and such the breadth of swamp and sand-barren lining its whole extent &mdash; can only be invaded from the <rs>Chesapeake</rs>, from <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, from New Orleans, or from the <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522"><rs type="direction">Upper</rs> Mississippi</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/><q>&#x0022;Those may not be the exact words, but that was what it amounted to. &#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/> <q>&#x0022;But that does not constitute stinginess,&#x0022;</q> said <persName><foreName>Eva</foreName></persName>; calmly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/><q>&#x0022;If he will not squander his limited means in idle and useless dissipation, he is more prudent than parsimonious, and far more deserving of credit than censure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>Nor is he at all backward in contributing to the enjoyment of his lady friends, as you yourself well know.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/>But, let me ask a question, <placeName reg="Florence, Florence, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013766">Florence</placeName> &mdash; probably that will throw some light on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/><q>&#x0022;His friends think that because he will not consent to &#x0027;treat and be treated&#x0027;--I believe those are the terms, my dear &mdash; because he will not actually squander his means and injure himself, both in body and reputation, that he is stingy; and he thinks differently, and with a true, manly independence, conducts himself according to his own impressions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>Richard Freely, probably, did not give the matter a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> thought-- <persName n="Lee,,Frederick,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00572" reg="default:Lee,Frederick,,,"><foreName>Frederick</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName>, too frequently exercised his charitable feelings to think the subject of any particular importance &mdash; and the girls had their own reasons for avoiding the topic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>Both the young ladies were a little cold to <persName n="Dick,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00573" reg="mostcommon:Dick,nomatch:0"><surname>Dick</surname></persName>, however; and, but for fear of betraying their secret, would probably have displayed their feelings still more pointedly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/> On the plea of a headache, <placeName reg="Florence, Florence, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013766">Florence</placeName> excused herself for not inviting Richard Freely into the house, as usual; and the next day &mdash; being really a woman of right mind and good principles --she returned the young gentleman his bracelet, and respectfully, but decidedly, declined the honor of his company, in any other respect than as an acquaintance. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>At length he yielded to his fate and went his way, and without the satisfaction of knowing what had led to his dismissal. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/> A short time afterward, <persName n="Lee,,Frederick,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00575" reg="default:Lee,Frederick,,,"><foreName>Frederick</foreName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> and <persName n="Darcy,,Eva,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00576" reg="default:Darcy,Eva,,,"><foreName>Eva</foreName> <surname>Darcy</surname></persName> were married, and the happy young bride never had the slightest reason to regret her choice of a husband.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>In a few years, <persName n="Lee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00577" reg="nearbymention:Lee,Frederick,,,"><surname>Lee</surname></persName> became a man of means and influence, and was much beloved abroad, as he was at his own pleasant fireside. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>A year or so after <placeName reg="Eva">Eva</placeName>'s marriage, she, too, gave herself away &mdash; confident, this time, that she had made a good selection, and would not be disappointed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/> <q>&#x0022;He's just like your <persName><foreName>Fred</foreName></persName>, I am sure!&#x0022;</q> she whispered to <placeName reg="Eva">Eva</placeName>, on her wedding night; and, happily, after times proved that her words were prophetic. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/> Subsequently, the gentlemen were let into the secret of the little event which I have just recorded; and, at the time of the revelation, <placeName reg="Eva">Eva</placeName> returned to her husband the <measure n="2dollars" type="currency">two dollars</measure> -- always carefully preserved &mdash; which he had so kindly bestowed upon the <hi rend="italics">so distant</hi> beggars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>The money, with a considerable addition, was afterwards handed over to a deserving charity. </p>
