<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>At <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> they supposed it to be a mere skirmish; perhaps even only the irregular discharge of muskets by guards and pickets, to clean out their guns, a practice which, to the disgrace of our discipline be it said, was well high universal and rendered it almost impossible at any time to know whether firing meant anything at all, beyond ordinary disorder of our own soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>But the continued rattle of musketry soon undeceived them, and almost as soon the advance of the rebels pouring after <persName n="Buckland,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="mostcommon:Buckland,nomatch:0"><surname>Buckland</surname></persName> was upon them. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The line wavered, the men fell back in squads and companies, they failed to rally promptly at the call of their officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>As they retreated the woods behind them became thinner, and there was less protection from the storm of grape that swept as if on blasts of a hurricane among the trees.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>As the troops gave way they came out from the open woods into old fields, completely raked by the enemy's fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>It had formed our extreme right, and of course had no support there; its supporting brigades on the left had gone; through the space they had occupied the rebels were pouring; they were in imminent danger of being entirely cut off, and back they fell, too, still further to the right and rear, among the ravines that border <rs n="Shoshoni" type="nativeamerican">Snake</rs> <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>The General himself was indefatigable in collecting and reorganizing his men, and a straggling contest was doubtless kept up along portions of his new lines, but with little weight in inclining the scales of battle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The General bore with him <num value="1">one</num> token of the danger to which he had exposed himself &mdash; a musket ball through the hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>It was the general expression of all that his escape so lightly was wonderful.--Whatever may be his faults or neglects, none can accuse him of a lack of gallantry and energy when the attack was made on his raw division that memorable <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time>. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>As <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00061" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> fell back, <persName n="McClernand,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00062" reg="mostcommon:McClernand,nomatch:0"><surname>McClernand</surname></persName> was compelled to bring in his brigades again to protect his left against the onset of the rebels, who, seeing how he had weakened himself there, and inspired by their recent success over <persName n="Prentiss,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00063" reg="mostcommon:Prentiss,nomatch:0"><surname>Prentiss</surname></persName>, hurled themselves against him with tremendous force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>To avoid bringing back these troops, a couple of new regiments, the <num value="15" type="ordinal">Fifteenth</num> and <orgName type="regiment" key="IW16">Sixteenth <rs n="Iowa" type="nativeamerican">Iowa</rs></orgName>, were brought up; but taking utterly raw troops on the field, under heavy fire, was too severe a trial for them and they gave way in confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>To meet the attack, then, the whole division made a change of front, and faced along the <placeName key="tgn,7017649" n="1.000 1055" reg="corinth, alcorn, mississippi">Corinth</placeName> road.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Here the batteries were placed in position, and till <time value="10oclock">10 o'clock</time> the rebels were foiled in every attempt to gain the road. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/> Suddenly a broad, sulphurous flash of light leaped out from the darkening woods, and through the glare and smoke came whistling the leaden hall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>The rebels were making their crowning effort for the day, and as was expected when our guns were hastily placed, they came from our left and centre.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>They had wasted their fire at <measure n="1000yards" type="distance">1,000 yards</measure>. Instantaneously our deep-mouthed bull-dogs flung out their sonorous response.

<head>The situation.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/> The same feeling which pervaded the city on the eve of the fight at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> seems to be prevalent now. It is of restless anxiety, not in the slightest degree tinged with fear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>The crisis does not appear to us to be so momentous as it was on the former occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>If our army had been defeated at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, the blow would have been well nigh fatal to the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>The only army which, at that period, we possessed, would have been utterly destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>The enemy would have advanced upon us both from <placeName key="tgn,7013920" n="1.000 1" reg="Fortress Monroe, Hampton, Virginia">Fortress Monroe</placeName> and <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and there would have been nothing to keep him back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>He would have arrived here almost without opposition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>He would have possessed himself of all our arms and munitions, and would thus have struck a deadly blow at the very heart of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>We were but half organized then, and most of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> were far worse off than we were. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/> Now the case is very different.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>Should our army be even compelled to fall back at <placeName reg="York, York, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014650">York</placeName>, there are many excellent battle fields between us and <placeName reg="York, York, Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7014650">York</placeName>, on every <num value="1">one</num> of which we can make a stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>Our chances of success increase with every step we take from the deep water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>Within <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty-four hours</measure>, a large force, independent of that now confronting the enemy on the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>, could be collected around this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>In the meantime, we do not believe that the <orgName>army of <persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00207" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,Gen,,,:1"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName></orgName> can beat our army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>On the contrary, we have no doubt that, if not more than <num value="3">three</num> to <num value="1">one</num>, they will be defeated should they attempt to advance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/> In the meantime, it is greatly to be deplored that the <orgName n="War Office" type="office">War office</orgName> does not take some steps to let the public know the truth with regard to all such results as they are sure to hear of in an exaggerated form through the <rs>Northern</rs> papers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>It is important that they should know the <hi rend="italics">truth</hi> from the fountain head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>The mystery which hangs over that office is to us unaccountable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>Of course, as we said yesterday, we would not have military movements exposed while there can be any possible reason for keeping them concealed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>But when they have already come to an issue, and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are in full possession of all the facts, what possible harm can there be in letting the public know the exact truth from the most authentic source &mdash; the <orgName n="War Office" type="office">War office</orgName>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>Even the reports which we get from that source, and which never come until long after the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> statements have been published and circulated throughout the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, are so meagre that they excite no feeling but disappointment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>We have had, thus far, no account of the <rs n="Battle of Shiloh" type="battle">battle of Shiloh</rs> on which we can rely.--Why cannot <persName n="Beauregard,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00208" reg="mostcommon:Beauregard,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Beauregard</surname></persName> write a narrative, or dictate <num value="1">one</num> to a secretary, and why cannot the <orgName n="War Office" type="office">War office</orgName> publish it? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/> We hold that the reports of <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> relative to battles should be published at once, not kept back for months.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>It is done by every other Government in the world, so far as we are aware.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>During the great <name>French</name> wars, the <rs>French</rs> people had a bulletin every <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3days" type="date">three days</measure> from the <rs>Emperor</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>The people thought they had a right know what was going on, and they would know it. Even in <placeName key="tgn,7002435" n="1.000 184" reg="rossiya">Russia</placeName>, the people were kept constantly advised of what the army was doing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>In <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName> alone were they kept in the dark, and we cannot see that <placeName key="tgn,1000062" n="1.000 128" reg="austria">Austria</placeName> ever derived much benefit from the concealment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>In the war of <placeName reg="Bharat" key="tgn,7000198">India</placeName>, the <placeName reg="Greater London" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> public had the dispatches of their <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> constantly laid before them in the newspaper, and <persName><foreName>Napoleon</foreName> <genName n="3">III</genName></persName>, in his <rs n="Italian" type="group">Italian</rs> campaign, sent long bulletins, for the public, by the telegraph, nearly every day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/> The appearance of mystery on the part of the <orgName n="War Office" type="office">War office</orgName>, whatever may be thought of it by officials, has a most deleterious effect.--Where there is mystery, the imagination of those not in the secret always puts an unfavorable interpretation upon it. If a battle has been fought the circumstance soon becomes known, and if a studied silence be observed with regard to the result the public is sure to believe that it is a defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>They can see no reason why the department should keep it from the people if it be a victory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>The department, it seems to us, ought to require a narrative of every defeat or victory from every General, and lay it before the public as soon as received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>The <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> Senate &mdash; the grand exemplar for all War officers &mdash; always pursued this course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>When news came of the disastrous defeat of Thrasymene, the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thing the <rs>Consul</rs> did, by order of the <name>Senate</name>, was to call an assembly of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>He rose to address them, and began his speech with <q>&#x0022;we have suffered a great defeat; the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> army has been destroyed at Thrasymene, and the <rs>Consul</rs> <unclear>Flamenius</unclear> is among the slain.&#x0022;</q> The people were overwhelmed at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> with consternation, but they gathered courage from despair, and soon began to think only of repairing the disaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>How much better was this than to leave the people in the dark, when it was impossible to conceal the truth from them more than a very few days. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/> The whole course of the war has shown us the importance and value of a Navy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>If that value and that importance had been appreciated at the beginning, how different would be our present condition.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>The experiments of late years in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName> and <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName> with ironclad vessels, had held out the prospect of the inauguration of a new mode of naval warfare, more efficient and powerful than any known to mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>The <rs>North</rs> had not yet availed itself of these new improvements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>It had only the old wooden Navy, but a small proportion of which was steam vessels, and armed merchant ships, which could not be relied upon in a general engagement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>If, at that time, our Commissioners to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> had been instructed to expend <num value="10">ten</num> or <num value="12000000">twelve millions</num> in the purchase of half a dozen iron clad vessels of war, the blockade would have been opened <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> ago. The triumphant success of the <rs>Virginia</rs> has proved what might have been accomplished by vessels of this description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>The whole Federal Navy, if it had dared to show its face in the presence of such adversaries, would have been sunk to the bottom of the ocean, and their own towns and seaports might have been blockaded and perhaps bombarded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>For the purpose of manning such a Navy, experienced seamen, as we have before observed, are not required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>With the aid of a few old sailors, soldiers will answer as well as seamen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>It is too late now to retrieve that error, but we may provide against future calamities by pushing to completion as speedily as possible the vessels now in course of construction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>A Navy is an imperative want of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>Fortunately, we have the choicest materials in officers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>The very flower of the old service is under the <rs>Confederate</rs> banner: men of science, of experience in their profession, of the most exalted heroism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>It should be the policy of the <rs>South</rs> to build up a strong Navy, not only for the protection of its own coasts, but as the guardians of the great commerce which our staples will produce when peace is restored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>There is no profession more attractive to men of chivalry and enterprise, and none which the <rs>South</rs> is more capable of rendering serviceable and efficient, as her naval officers have already proved in the limited theatre of action upon which they have been lately engaged. </p> </div3> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/>

<head>The Northern press.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/> It is infinitely amusing to behold the mysterious and awful silence of the <rs>Northern</rs> newspapers upon the subject of the removal of <orgName n="army"><persName n="McClellan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00210" reg="mostcommon:McClellan,Gen,,,:1"><surname>McClellan</surname></persName>'s army</orgName> to the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>The military authorities required the newspapers not to publish <num value="1">one</num> word upon the subject, lest it might put <q>&#x0022;the rebels&#x0022;</q> on their guard, but <q>&#x0022;the rebels&#x0022;</q> knew it as soon as the <rs>Federals</rs> themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>The idea that the leaders on either side derive information of the enemy's movements from looking at their newspapers, is simply ridiculous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>All the information that can be obtained by either comes through channels employed for that purpose, and is received and made use of long before it can appear in print.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>Another absurdity which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have great reason to complain of, is the with holding by their Government of the real facts in regard to the results of important movements and battles, keeping them in the dark as completely as if they had no interest in the matter, and often leading them to believe in victories, when they have, in fact, met reverses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/>Of course, a Government that deals thus with its people must, sooner or later, not only lose their confidence, but become an object of loathing and contempt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/> Simply as a matter of policy, the <rs>Northern</rs> despotism is stultifying itself in not permitting its subjects to know the disasters of its arms, because the truth cannot be always kept from them, and when they do learn it, the effect will be worse than if permitted to know it from the beginning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>A people who have not firmness enough to be trusted with the knowledge of reverses, cannot be relied on to carry on a war, and a Government which does not trust them, must become itself an object of suspicion in return. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>Every <num value="1">one</num> knows that the very reverse is the truth, and that these men have received humane treatment from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> moment they fell into our hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="341"/>What new horrors our enemies have in contemplation, that they are now putting forth fresh fabrications of Southern cruelty, we cannot imagine.
