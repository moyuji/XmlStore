<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> Yesterday was the most quiet period that has occurred since the commencement of active operations in the vicinity of <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>No reverberations of cannon broke the stillness of the air, nor were there any exciting &#x0022;rumors from the front&#x0022; to disturb the equanimity of the inhabitants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Persons from the lines report that <persName n="Grant,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="nearbymention:Grant,Gen,,,"><surname>Grant</surname></persName> is moving his forces around our right, but what his purpose is remains to be developed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>In the absence of official information, we forbear to speculate upon probabilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>We have a commander who anticipates every movement of the enemy, and in their confidence in his skill and sagacity the people rest securely. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>This reconnaissance established the fact that the enemy had changed their position, and beyond this, and some slight skirmishing, nothing took place yesterday worthy of note. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> A number of wounded <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were brought in last evening, some of whom had lain in front of the works where they fell since <dateStruct><day type="name">Friday</day></dateStruct>.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> The information published yesterday morning of the advance of the enemy from <num value="2">two</num> directions upon <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName> gave rise to some apprehensions for the safety of that place, and early in the day rumors of a miscellaneous and exaggerated character were in circulation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The news which we give below is based upon official dispatches, and may be relied upon as correct. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> The enemy advanced on Sunday from <placeName reg="Port Republic, Rockingham, Virginia" key="tgn,2113715">Port Republic</placeName>, by way of <placeName reg="Mount Crawford, Rockingham, Virginia" key="tgn,7016373">Mount Crawford</placeName>, as far as <orgName n="New Hope Church" type="church">New Hope Church</orgName>, <num value="11">eleven</num> or <placeName><distance reg="12miles">twelve miles</distance> from <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName></placeName>, on the <placeName key="possibilities=20" n="1.000 10" reg=",">Valley</placeName> road, where they were met by a force under <persName n="Jones,General,William,E.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00016" reg="default:Jones,William,E.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>An engagement ensued, at an early period of which <persName n="Jones,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="nearbymention:Jones,William,E.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName> was killed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>His command, overwhelmed by superior numbers, and their leader shot down, were compelled to fall back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The enemy finding this obstruction removed from their path advanced, and at a subsequent period took possession of the town of <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName>.--After the death of <persName n="Jones,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="nearbymention:Jones,William,E.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName>, the command of our forces devolved on <persName n="Vaughan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Vaughan,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Vaughan</surname></persName>.--All, or nearly all, the <rs type="place">Government stores</rs> had been previously removed from <placeName reg="Staunton, Staunton, Virginia" key="tgn,7014538">Staunton</placeName> to a place of security. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> We are assured that the report that the enemy have occupied <placeName reg="Waynesboro, Waynesboro, Virginia" key="tgn,2114939">Waynesboro</placeName>' is without foundation; nor is there any confirmation of the extravagant rumor that a raiding party visited <placeName reg="Lexington, Lexington, Virginia" key="tgn,7013889">Lexington</placeName> and burned the <orgName n="Washington College" type="college">Washington College</orgName> and the <orgName n="Virginia Military Institute" type="institute">Virginia Military Institute</orgName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>He was a native, we believe, of <placeName key="tgn,2110224" n="1.000 55" reg="abingdon, washington, virginia">Abingdon</placeName>, and commenced his military career in the present war, soon after its commencement, under <persName n="Stuart,General,J.,E.,B.," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="default:Stuart,J.,E.,B.,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Stuart</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Being ordered to <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Southwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName>, he proceeded to reorganize the cavalry in that department, and soon rendered it an active and efficient arm of the service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Brave and gallant almost to a fault, he inspired his men with confidence, and had he not, by his dashing courage, sought the post of danger, which to him proved fatal, it is quite probable that the result of the fight at <orgName n="New Hope Church" type="church">New Hope Church</orgName> would have been far different. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/> Till now it had been a leading principle in the construction of cannon that the windage should be diminished to the greatest possible extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>This new gun, however, proceeded on the principle of utilizing the windage, and rendering it serviceable for the purposes of the weapon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>The projectile used was a smooth cylindrical bolt, and the interior of the gun was furnished with spiral grooves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>The gas escaping up these grooves communicated a rotary motion to the bolt similar to that of a rifle ball.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>This system, if it could be successfully worked, would, of course, lessen the necessity for extraordinary strength in cannon and for very heavy charges, and would also reduce the amount of the recoil. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/> It was stated that the initial velocity obtained at the trial in question was remarkably high.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>The gun was manufactured at the well-known establishment of the <rs>Mersey Steel</rs> and Iron Works.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>It weighed <num value="9">nine</num>-tons, and was fired with a charge of <measure n="30pounds" type="mass">30 lbs</measure>, and a projectile of <measure n="167pounds" type="mass">167 lbs</measure>, at a range of <measure n="200yards" type="distance">200 yards</measure>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>It consisted of a plate of iron, <measure n="5.5inches" type="distance">5&#x00BD; inches</measure> thick, backed by <measure n="9inches" type="distance">9 inches</measure> of teak, with behind another plate of iron about <measure n="1inch" type="distance">1 inch</measure> thick, a series of strong bolts, and last of all a thick plank of timber.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>The bolt struck nearly the centre of the target, shattered the woodwork, and passed through the whole breadth of the target, many yards beyond which it was found, carrying with it a plug of iron which it had drilled out of the plate in its progress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>If that statement was correct, the performance was certainly most extraordinary, and it was remarkable that the plug and the bolt were found lying nearly together on the sand, the marks on which showed that the rotary motion had been continued to the last.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>A Federal official, bearing a commission from the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, obtained, under pretext of seeking lodgings, access to the chambers of a gentleman supposed to be implicated in the building of some suspected vessel in the <rs>Clyde</rs>, and upon the date acquired in this ingenious reconnaissance, a search-warrant was actually issued afterwards, though, of course, without producing the expected revelations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>That we are not exaggerating the extent of the organization to which this system of Federal espionage has been carried, will be evident to every ordinary reader of the news papers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>It is a notorious fact, repeatedly complained of through the press, that every considerable shipyard in <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> is watched by spies.
