<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> The <rs type="place">House</rs> took up the unfinished business of <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, being the bill to provide for placing in the military service persons claiming to be citizens of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>The question was upon the passage of the substitute of <persName n="Chilton,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Chilton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chilton</surname></persName>, requiring all persons between the ages of <num value="18">18</num> and <num value="45">45</num> who may be resident in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> after the <date value="02-01">1st day of February</date> next, to be subject to enrollment in the military service of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, regardless of any claim of non-residence or alienage which they may set up; but leaving it discretionary with the <rs>President</rs>, upon considerations of equity and justice, or of public necessity, to exempt such persons. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> The call for the question upon the passage of the bill was not sustained, and <persName n="Clapp,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Clapp,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Clapp</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Miss.</placeName>, offered an amendment to the substitute of <persName n="Chilton,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Chilton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chilton</surname></persName>, extending the time allowed to the class of persons alluded to, to <measure n="60days" type="date">sixty days</measure> from the passage of the bill, and moved that the whole subject be recommitted. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> Their bedsteads were small iron stools, fastened to the wall with hinges.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>They could be hooked up or allowed to stand on the floor, and to prevent any suspicion, for several days before any work was attempted they made it a habit to let them down and sit at their doors and read.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/><persName n="Hines,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="mostcommon:Hines,Elizabeth,,,:1"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Hines</surname></persName> superintended the work, while <persName n="Morgan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00035" reg="nearbymention:Morgan,John,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Morgan</surname></persName> kept watch to divert the attention of the sentinel, whose duty it was to come around during the day and observe if anything was going on. <num value="1">One</num> day this fellow came in while Hokersmith was down under the floor boring away, and, missing him, said, &#x0022;Where is Hokersmith?&#x0022; The General replied, &#x0022;He is in my room, sick,&#x0022; and immediately pulled a document out of his pocket and said to him: &#x0022;Here is a memorial I have drawn up to forward to the <rs>Government</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> &mdash; what do you think of it?&#x0022; The fellow, who, perhaps, could not read, being highly flattered at the <rs>General</rs>'s condescension, took it and very gravely looked at it for several moments before he vouchsafed any reply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Then, handing it back, he expressed himself highly pleased with it. In the meantime <rs>Hokersmith</rs> had been signaled and came up, professing to feel &#x0022;very unwell. &#x0022; This sentinel was the most difficult and dangerous obstacle in their progress, because there was no telling at what time he would enter during the day, and at night he came regularly every <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure> to each cell and inserted a light through the bars of their door to see that they were quietly sleeping, and frequently after he had completed his rounds he would slip back in the dark with a pair of <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName> rubber shoes on, to listen at their cells if anything was going on. The General says that he would almost invariably know of his presence by a certain magnetic shudder which it would produce; but for fear that this acute sensibility might sometimes fall him, he broke up small particles of coal every morning and sprinkled it before the cell door, which would always announce his coming. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> Everything was now ready to begin the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>So about the latter part of <dateStruct value="-10-"><month reg="10">October</month></dateStruct> they commenced to bore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>All were busy &mdash; was making a rope ladder by tearing and twisting up strips of bed tick, another making <rs n="bowie knives" type="product">bowie-knives</rs>, and <unclear></unclear> twisting up towels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>They labored perseveringly for several days, and after boring through <num value="9">nine</num> <milestone unit="column" n="5"/> inches of cement, and <num value="9">nine</num> thicknesses of brick placed edgewise, they began to wonder when they should reach the soft earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>Suddenly a brick fell through.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>What could this mean?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>What infernal chamber had they reached?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>It was immediately entered, and, to their great astonishment and joy, it proved to be an air chamber extending the whole length of the row of cells.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>Here was an unexpected interposition in their favor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>Hitherto they had been obliged to conceal their rubbish in their bed ticks, each day burning a proportionate quantity of straw; now they had room enough for all they could dig. They at once commenced to tunnel at right angles with this air chamber, to get through the foundation; and day after day they bored, day after day the blocks of granite were removed, and still the work before them seemed interminable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> After <measure n="23days" type="date">twenty-three days</measure> of unremitting labor, and getting through a granite wall of <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> in thickness, they reached the soil.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>They tunnelled up for some distance, and light began to shine.--How glorious was that light.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>It announced the fulfillment of their labors, and if <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> would only continue its favor, they would soon be free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>This was the morning of the <date value="1863-11-26">26th day of November, 1863.</date> The next night, at <time value="12oclock">12 o'clock</time>, was determined on as the hour at which they would attempt their liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Each moment that intervened was filled with dreadful anxiety and suspense, and each time the guard entered increased their apprehensions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The General says he had prayed for rain, but the morning of the <num value="27" type="ordinal">27th</num> dawned bright and beautiful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>The evening came, and clouds began to gather.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>How they prayed for them to increase.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>If rain should only begin, their chances of detection would be greatly lessened.--While these thoughts were passing through their minds, the keeper entered with a letter for <persName n="Morgan,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00036" reg="nearbymention:Morgan,John,H.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Morgan</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>He opened it, and what was his surprise, and I may say wonder, to find it from a poor <rs n="Irish" type="group">Irish</rs> woman of his acquaintance in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName>, commencing, &#x0022;My dear Ginral, I feel certain you are going to try to git out of prison, but for your sake don't you try it, my dear Ginral.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>You will only be taken prisoner agin, and made to suffer more than you do now.&#x0022; The letter then went on to speak of his kindness to the poor when he lived at <placeName reg="Lexington, Lexington, Virginia" key="tgn,7013889">Lexington</placeName>, and concluded by again exhorting him to trust in <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and wait his time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>What could this mean?--No human being on the outside had been informed of his intention to escape, and yet, just as all things were ready for him to make the attempt, here comes a letter from <placeName reg="Winchester, Clark, Kentucky" key="tgn,2041985">Winchester, Kentucky</placeName>, advising him not to &#x0022;try it.&#x0022; This letter had passed through the examining office of <persName n="Mason,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00037" reg="mostcommon:Mason,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Mason</surname></persName>, and then through the hands of the lower officials.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>What if it should excite their suspicion and cause them to exercise an increased vigilance?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Their situation, however, was desperate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Their fate could not be much worse, and they resolved to go. Nothing now remained to be done but for the <rs>General</rs> and <persName n="Morgan,Colonel,Dick,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00038" reg="default:Morgan,Dick,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Colonel</roleName> <foreName>Dick</foreName> <surname>Morgan</surname></persName> to change cells.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>The hour approached for them to be locked up. They changed coats, and each stood at the other's cell door with his back exposed, and pretended to be engaged in making up their beds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>As the turnkey entered they &#x0022;turned in&#x0022; and pulled their doors shut.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/><num value="6">Six</num>, <num value="8">eight</num>, <time value="10oclock">ten o'clock</time> came.--How each pulse throbbed as they quietly awaited the approach of <num value="12">twelve</num>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>It came &mdash; the sentinel passed his round &mdash; all well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>After waiting a few moments, to see if he intended to slip back, the signal was given &mdash; all quietly slipped down into the air chamber, <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> stuffing their flannel shirts and placing them in bed as they were accustomed to lie. As they moved quietly along through the dark recess to the terminus where they were to emerge from the earth, the <rs>General</rs> prepared to light a match.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>As the lurid glare fell upon their countenances a scene was presented which can never be forgotten.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>There were crouched <num value="7">seven</num> brave men, who had resolved to be free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>They were armed with <rs n="bowie knives" type="product">bowie-knives</rs> made out of case-knives.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Life, in their condition, was scarcely to be desired, and the moment for the desperate chance had arrived.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Suppose, as they emerged from the ground, that the dog should give the alarm &mdash; they could but die. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/> But few moments were spent in this kind of apprehension.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>The hour had arrived, and yet they came.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>Fortunately &mdash; yes, providentially, the night had suddenly grown dark and rainy; the dogs had retired to their kennels, and the sentinels had taken refuge under shelter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>The inner wall, by the aid of the rope ladder, was soon scaled, and now the outer <num value="1">one</num> had to be attempted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/><persName n="Taylor,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00039" reg="mostcommon:Taylor,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Taylor</surname></persName>, (who, by the way, is a nephew of old <persName n="Zack,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00040" reg="mostcommon:Zack,nomatch:0"><surname>Zack</surname></persName>,) being a very active man, by the assistance of his comrades, reached the top of the gate, and was enabled to get the rope over the wall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>When the top was gained they found a rope extending all around, which the <rs>General</rs> immediately cut, as he suspected that it might lead into the warden's room.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>This turned out to be correct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>They then entered the sentry box on the wall and changed their clothes, and let themselves down the wall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>In sliding down the <rs>General</rs> skinned his hand very badly, and all were more or less bruised.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>Once down, they separated.--<persName n="Taylor,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00041" reg="mostcommon:Taylor,nomatch:0"><surname>Taylor</surname></persName> and <persName n="Shelton,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00042" reg="mostcommon:Shelton,nomatch:0"><surname>Shelton</surname></persName> going <num value="1">one</num> way, Hokersmith, <persName n="Bennett,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00043" reg="mostcommon:Bennett,nomatch:0"><surname>Bennett</surname></persName>, and <persName n="McGee,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00044" reg="mostcommon:McGee,nomatch:0"><surname>McGee</surname></persName> another, and <persName n="Gen,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00045" reg="mostcommon:Gen,nomatch:0"><surname>Gen</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>The General had, by paying <measure n="15dollars" type="currency">fifteen dollars</measure> in gold, succeeded in obtaining a paper which informed him of the schedule time of the different roads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>The clock struck <num value="1">one</num>, and he knew by hurrying he could reach the down train for <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>He got there just as the train was moving off. He at once looked on to see if there were any soldiers on board, and espying a Federal officer, he boldly walked up and took a seat beside him. He remarked to him that, &#x0022;as the night was damp and chilly, perhaps he would join him in a drink&#x0022; He did so, and the party soon became very agreeable to each other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>The cars in crossing the <rs>Scioto</rs> have to pass within a short distance of the <name>Penitentiary</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>As they passed, the officer remarked; &#x0022;There's the hotel at which <persName n="Morgan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00047" reg="nearbymention:Morgan,Dick,,,"><surname>Morgan</surname></persName> and his officers are spending their leisure.&#x0022; &#x0022;Yes,&#x0022; replied the <rs>General</rs>, &#x0022;and I sincerely hope he will make up his mind to board there during the balance of the war, for he is a great nuisance.&#x0022; When the train reached Zenia it was detained by some accident more than an hour.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>Imagine his anxiety, as soldier after soldier would pass through the train, for fear that when the sentinel passed his round at <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time> their absence might be discovered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>The train was due in <placeName reg="Cincinnati, Hamilton, Ohio" key="tgn,7013604">Cincinnati</placeName> at <time value="6oclock">six o'clock</time>. This was the hour at which they were turned out of their cells, and of course their escape would be then discovered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>In a few moments after it would be known all over the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>The train, having been detained at <placeName key="tgn,2015080" n="1.000 10" reg="Zenia, Trinity, California">Zenia</placeName>, was running very rapidly to make up the time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>It was already past <time value="6oclock">six o'clock</time>. The General said to <persName n="Hines,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00048" reg="mostcommon:Hines,Elizabeth,,,:1"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Hines</surname></persName>: &#x0022;It is after <num value="6">six</num>; if we go to the depot we are dead men. Now or never!&#x0022; They went to the rear and put on the brakes. &#x0022;Jump, <persName n="Hines,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00049" reg="mostcommon:Hines,Elizabeth,,,:1"><surname>Hines</surname></persName>!&#x0022; Off he went, and fell heels over head in the mud. Another severe turn of the brake, and the <rs>General</rs> jumped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>He was more successful, and fighted on his feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>There were some soldiers near, who remarked: &#x0022;What in the h &mdash; l do you mean by jumping off the cars here?&#x0022; The General replied: &#x0022;What in the d &mdash; l is the use of my going into town when I live here; and, besides, what business is it of yours? &#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/> They went immediately to the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>They found a skiff, but no oars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>Soon a little boy came over, and appeared to be waiting. &#x0022;What are you waiting for?&#x0022; said the <rs>General</rs>. &#x0022;I am waiting for my load?&#x0022; &#x0022;What is the price of a load?&#x0022;-- &#x0022;<measure n="2dollars" type="currency">Two dollars</measure>.&#x0022; &#x0022;Well, as we are tired and hungry, we will give you the <measure n="2dollars" type="currency">two dollars</measure>, and you can put us over.&#x0022; So, over he took them. &#x0022;Where does <rs type="role2">Miss</rs> &mdash; live?&#x0022; &#x0022;Just a short distance from here.&#x0022; &#x0022;Will you show me her house?&#x0022; &#x0022;Yes, sir.&#x0022; The house was reached; a fine breakfast was soon obtained, money and a horse furnished, a good woman's prayer bestowed, and off he went.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>From there forward through <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> everybody vied with each other as to who should show him the most attention, even to the negroes; and young ladies of refinement begged the honor to cook his meals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>He remained in <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> some days, feeling perfectly safe, and sending into <placeName reg="Louisville, Jefferson, Kentucky" key="tgn,7013915">Louisville</placeName> for many little things he wanted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>Went to <placeName key="tgn,2037601" n="1.000 49" reg="bardstown, nelson, kentucky">Bardstown</placeName> and found a Federal regiment had just arrived there looking for him. Remained here and about for <num value="3">three</num> or <measure n="4days" type="date">four days</measure>, and then struck out for Dixie, sometimes disguising himself as a Government cattle contractor, and buying a large lot of cattle; at other times a Quartermaster, until he got to the <placeName key="tgn,2715022" n="1.000 335" reg="tennessee river, united states, north and central america">Tennessee river</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>Here he found all means of transportation destroyed, and the bank strongly guarded; but with the assistance of about <num value="30">thirty</num> others, who had recognized him and joined him in spite of his remonstrances, he succeeded in making a raft, and he and <persName n="Hines,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00050" reg="mostcommon:Hines,Elizabeth,,,:1"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Hines</surname></persName> crossed over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/>His escort, with heroic self sacrifice, refused to cross until he was safely over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>He then hired a negro to get his horse over, paying him <measure n="20dollars" type="currency">$20</measure> for it. The river was so high that the horse came near drowning, and after more than <num value="1">one</num> hour's struggling with the stream was pulled out, so exhausted as scarcely to be able to stand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>The General threw a blanket on him and commenced to walk him, when suddenly, he says, he was seized with a presentiment that he would be attacked, and remarking to <persName n="Hines,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00051" reg="mostcommon:Hines,Elizabeth,,,:1"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Hines</surname></persName>, &#x0022;We will be attacked in <measure n="20minutes" type="date">twenty minutes</measure>,&#x0022; commenced saddling his horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>He had hardly tied his girth when &#x0022;bang,&#x0022; went the <rs>Minnie</rs> balls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>He bounced his horse, and the noble animal appearing to be inspired with new vigor, bounded off like a deer up the mountain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/> About <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> since Congress passed a law imposing a heavy tax upon all obligations, or other evidences of indebtedness, held by persons who refused to receive payment in Confederate money at its nominal value.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/>The iniquitous character of such a law need not be pointed out. It enabled knaves to get rid of their debts at <num value="1">one</num>-<num value="5" type="ordinal">fifth</num> of their real value, and compelled debtors to a ruinous sacrifice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>It was altogether favorable to the knave, and altogether oppressive to the honest man. It acted unequally upon the <num value="2">two</num> grand classes into which the community is divided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>It was altogether in favor of the debtor, who had already in his favor an act postponing the collection of debts until after the war. The object of Congress, however, was laudable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>The law was designed to prop the falling currency.--It was doubted whether it had the power to make Confederate notes a legal tender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>This law does not <hi rend="italics">declare</hi> Confederate money to be a legal tender, but it makes it so to all intents and purposes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/> Well, it has been thoroughly tried for a whole year, or nearly so. Has it arrested the downward tendency of the currency?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/>Let facts speak.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>This time last year the currency stood about <num value="5">five</num> to <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>At this moment it stands <num value="20">twenty</num> to <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>Last year, at this time, the currency was worth <measure n="20cents" type="currency">twenty cents</measure> in the dollar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>At this moment it is worth <hi rend="italics"><num value="5">five</num></hi> cents in the dollar.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>The presumption is that it has not had the <hi rend="italics">good</hi> effect expected from it, and <hi rend="italics">has</hi> had all the bad effects which, it is to be hoped, its projectors did not anticipate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/>It has debauched the public conscience, by tempting men who otherwise would not have thought of such a thing, to get rid of just debts at the expense of those to whom they were due. It has made knaves of men who would not have been such had not the law openly invited them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>It has ruined many an honest creditor by putting him in the power of a fraudulent debtor.--But it has not arrested for <num value="1">one</num> moment the down-hill progress of the currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="230"/>It ought to be abolished by Congress for their own honor, and for the honor of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/>It is said that <num value="1">one</num> of the provisions of the new tax bill for the support of Government levies a tax of <num value="0.2">twenty per cent</num>, on every debt which has been paid off since the war began in Confederate notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/>This amounts to a confession that the law is a shameful law, and ought to be abolished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>Let it be done forthwith for the sake of the country's honor. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>It has been tried over and often, and where has it ever succeeded?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>We confess we recollect no instance of the kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>A writer in the <hi rend="italics">Sentinel,</hi> a few days since, handled this subject with great ability, and we are indebted in part to him for the facts which we are about to state.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>The other <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> States all emitted bills of credit, guarded by penal laws of the same description, but they could not arrest the depreciation of the currency thereby.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>They all either declared the bills a legal tender, or, which amounts to the same thing, made the refusal to take them at par highly penal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>The history of the <rs>Continental</rs> money is well understood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>The Congress of '<num value="76">76</num> declared that whoever refused to take it at <hi rend="italics">par</hi> should be regarded as an enemy to his country, and precluded from intercourse with its inhabitants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>Yet, in <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure>, in spite of <hi rend="italics">legal tender acts,</hi> in spite of limitations in prices, in spite of awful threatening, and penal laws with ruinous <sic>punishishments,</sic> enacted at different times, it had depreciated to the tune of <num value="1000">one thousand</num> for <num value="1">one</num>, and in a little time thereafter expired without a groan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>The effect of these laws, (legal tender laws,) says <persName n="Morris,,Gouverneur,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00136" reg="default:Morris,Gouverneur,,,"><foreName>Gouverneur</foreName> <surname>Morris</surname></persName>, &#x0022;is to destroy, and not to sustain, the value of the declining currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>If a dollar in paper is as good as a dollar in silver, why compel the holder of <num value="1">one</num> to exchange it for the other?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>The plea of necessity will not arrest the clamor of inquiry, nor soften the iniquity of injustice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>Legal tender laws tend to destroy the confidence of the people in the integrity as well as the wisdom of their rulers.&#x0022; </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/> In <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, when the <hi rend="italics">assignats</hi> had fallen to <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> for <num value="1">one</num>, the <orgName n="National Assembly" type="assembly">National Assembly</orgName> attempted to arrest the depreciation by enacting that any man who should exchange any quantity of <rs type="color">silver</rs> or <rs type="color">gold</rs> for <hi rend="italics">assignats</hi> at less than their nominal value should suffer <measure n="6years" type="date">six years</measure> imprisonment in irons, and prescribed the same punishment for any person who should ask a greater price for merchandize in <hi rend="italics">assignats</hi> than it would bring in gold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>They afterwards made <hi rend="italics">assignats</hi> a legal tender, and succeeded in ruining a vast number of creditors, but they could not succeed in arresting the depreciation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>In a few years the <hi rend="italics">assignats</hi> fell to <num value="100">one hundred</num> for <num value="1">one</num>, and before they were finally disposed of, the sum of <num value="16000">16,000</num> francs (<measure n="3200dollars" type="currency">$3,200</measure>) in that currency was paid for a single breakfast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>The reason why depreciation cannot be stopped by legal tender laws is obvious enough.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>It is always caused by redundancy, and such laws do not reach the root of the evil. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/> The notes of the <orgName n="Bank of England" type="bank">Bank of England</orgName> were made a legal tender everywhere in the realm, except at the counter of the bank itself, in <dateStruct value="1835--"><year reg="1835">1835</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>But why?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>Because they are perfectly convertible, and always command pound for pound and shilling for shilling upon presentation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>Nobody thought of making them a legal tender during the long interval from <dateStruct value="1797--"><year reg="1797">1797</year></dateStruct> to <dateStruct value="1817--"><year reg="1817">1817</year></dateStruct>, when the bank suspended specie payment, although the depreciation was never greater than is implied by the fact that <num value="46">forty-six</num> guineas in gold bought <num value="56">fifty-six</num> guineas in <orgName n="Bank of England" type="bank">Bank of England</orgName> notes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>It is strange that after so much and such hardly bought experience, people will still talk of legal tender laws. </p> </div3>
