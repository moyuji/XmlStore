<head>From <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="9"/> All that we heard yesterday from this town, upon which is centred the great interest of the war, was that all was quiet to a late hour in the day. There were reports that the enemy were leaving their position opposite the town, and as no active movement has taken place in front of our lines, it is not improbable that their forces are being withdrawn for embarkation at Aquia <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/>The condition of our men is spoken of as being good, and it is likely that <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> was not eager to risk a fight with the army he found confronting him.

<head>Investing in bonds.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> In some parts of the <rs>State</rs> there is a patriotic disposition manifested to invest money in Confederate bonds, in preference to indulging in speculation in the necessaries of life.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The <placeName reg="Jefferson county, West Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002269">county of Jefferson</placeName> has within the last <measure n="3months" type="date">three months</measure>, as we are informed by <num value="1">one</num> of her principal business men, sent to <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> nearly <num value="500000">five hundred thousand</num> soldiers to be funded in <num value="0.08">eight per cent</num> bonds, thus relieving the circulation of the <rs>Government</rs> to that extent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>If every county in the <rs>Confederacy</rs> would do as well, there need be no apprehension of a depreciation of the <rs>Government</rs> currency.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> Nothing of any great moment occurred during the march, except that it was conducted with great order &mdash; few or no stragglers to be seen &mdash; and such was the rapidity of the march that the citizens of the very few houses to be found were taken by surprise, not dreaming of an advance of our forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The countenances of all whom we came across plainly told of their astonishment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The first place of any name, after leaving the <rs type="place">Junction</rs>, was <placeName reg="Elk Run, Randolph, West Virginia" key="tgn,2314675">Elk Run</placeName> a village consisting of <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> houses, with the usual out-buildings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>A great majority of the dwellings in this county are built of logs, and are very uncomfortable within, invariably being heated by fires on the hearth &mdash; not the large fire-places where <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a cord of wood can be used at once, but miserable little fire places narrow and contracted, of just sufficient use to freeze <num value="1">one</num> to death at the opposite side of the room, away from the fire.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The inhabitants of this region are indeed a <num value=".5">&#x00BD;</num>shiftless<num value=".5">&#x00BD;</num> set.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>The original tavern was burned down some time ago. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> Just previous to reaching this place, where the troops encamped, the marks of a former invading army can easily be traced by fences being down, made through ploughed fields no signs of husbandry, no shocks of corn-fodder standing &mdash; all is gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/><num value="1" type="ordinal">First</num> came our forces, then came the <rs>Confederates</rs>, away they go, and then our forces again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>All these troops must be fed, and the consequence is the which country is skinned completely out.--as most of the other armies passed in the summer very little fire was used by the troops, consequently very few rail fences were destroyed Now it is quite different; the cold snap has made a fire very agreeable, and as the rails make a quick and hot fire, they are used by <num value="1000">thousands</num>, much to the chagrin and discomfiture of the <rs>Secesh</rs> farmers.--Last night bright fights could be seen for miles, looking not unlike to a large city with all the street camps and stores lit up. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>The day opened on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Sunday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> with a dull and heavy sky, giving evidence that a storm was brewing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>By noon it cleared up somewhat, and the sun came cut, warming the chilled atmosphere. --late in the afternoon it again clouded up, the weather becoming quite cold and raw. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The weather all day yesterday was threatening, and quite cool.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>In the morning a very heavy fog impeded observation, and drops of it fell like rain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Once or twice during the morning it attempted to rain, but did not succeed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Late in the afternoon the sun partially made his appearance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>We all hope there will be no rain until the whole army is <hi rend="italics">en route</hi> for its destination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Up to to-day the roads have been very good for the passage of an army, but <num value="1">one</num> severe raid of a day or <num value="2">two</num> will make them impassible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>The soil is cloyed in some places, while in many others it is very sandy and gravelly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The road here and from the <rs type="place">Junction</rs> runs on a ridge, and is almost a desert, so far as water is concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>What few streams there are running seem to be nothing but muddy pools.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Water is very scarce, and the troops, after the long march, were suffering for the want of it. At the headquarters of <persName n="Sumner,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName> there is a well of good water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The advance guard placed a sentry over this well, ordering him to allow no <num value="1">one</num> to get water from it except an officer from headquarters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>When <persName n="Sumner,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="mostcommon:Sumner,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Sumner</surname></persName> heard of this order he went to the sentry at the well, in person, and gave him instructions to let all get water who wanted it, at the same time stating that he would rather go without water himself than to let his men go thirsty. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/> Some of the inhabitants of this almost deserted region have been in mortal fear of the <num value=".5">&#x00BD;</num><rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs><num value=".5">&#x00BD;</num> for some time past, as they had been told our troops kill women and children, and burn all dwellings &mdash; A female at the house used as headquarters, near the <rs type="place">Spotted Tavern</rs>, implored us not to kill her or the children, and was most agreeably surprised when she learned that was not our line of business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>She had heard we had been burning and destroying all within our reach. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/> A number of our troops, while overhauling a wheelwright shop some miles from the tavern found an Alabama ambulance and some <num value="25">25</num> shot guns, with patterns for gun-stocks, &#x0026;c. The guns were rather roughly handled, and the remnants left as mementoes of the past. </p> </q><bibl n="Philadelphia Inquirer"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/> It is said upon good authority that there are <num value="5">five</num> <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName> regiments and <persName n="Crutch,Major,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00015" reg="mostcommon:Crutch,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Major">Major</roleName> <surname>Crutch</surname></persName>'s rebel <orgName n="Cavalry Brigade" type="brigade">cavalry brigade</orgName> in <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> to dispute our crossing.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> <placeName reg="Falmouth, Stafford, Virginia" key="tgn,2111731">Falmouth</placeName> is a very old town, some of the houses dating as far back as <dateStruct value="1717--"><year reg="1717">1717</year></dateStruct>, and some claim a greater antiquity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>A portion of the town has a neat air about it, while the mass of the houses are old and ill-shaped.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>There is not a public house in the whole town, or any place for strangers to stop.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>The best houses are white frames, while the old antiquities are the old- fashioned bricks, with heavy garret windows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>Very few men are to be seen, but there are an abundance of women and children. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/> During the silencing of the batteries across the river the utmost consternation prevailed among the inhabitants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>The children seemed very much frightened. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> During the early part of yesterday morning a ferry scow, belonging to <persName n="Fichler,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00017" reg="mostcommon:Fichler,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Fichler</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Falmouth, Stafford, Virginia" key="tgn,2111731">Falmouth</placeName> was destroyed by the rebels to prevent our crossing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>The river is fordable in many places, and this will have very little effect in keeping back the troops of <orgName n="Division"><persName n="Hancock,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Hancock,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hancock</surname></persName>'s Division</orgName> and the remainder of the column. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> This morning has opened again threatening rain, but our army is safe, the mass of it having got over the roads; in fact, the roads have been <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>-rate for the artillery and teams. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/> During the march to this point our troops were in the very best spirits; their merry, echoing voices rung through the forests, raising the spirits of the weary ones in the rear, all hurrying on towards this point. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>The <num value="2">two</num> trains of cars that were observed leaving <placeName reg="Fredericksburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013943">Fredericksburg</placeName> last evening carried away with them, no doubt, many a guilty head whose cowardly consciences feared to let them meet the <rs>Union</rs> forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Each discharge of our battery at them, as they hurried away, must have caused their cheeks to blanch at the prospect of receiving a shell in the trains. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The enemy succeeded last night in getting their battery away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>About dusk they brought a limber over a bridge that spans a branch stream, and our battery gave them a parting shot just as night came on. </p>
