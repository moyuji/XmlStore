<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>About <num value="1">1</num> or <time value="2pm">2 P.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>The <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson (Miss.)</placeName> <hi rend="italics">Appeal,</hi> however, has an account of the treatment of the <rs>Confederates</rs> taken on the retreat of <persName n="Pemberton,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00056" reg="mostcommon:Pemberton,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Pemberton</surname></persName> from <placeName key="tgn,2557302" n="1.000 85" reg="old little tallahatchie river, mississippi">Tallahatchie</placeName> which will, we think, convince the <rs>Southern</rs> people that they have not yet heard the half of the brutality practised upon their sons and brothers who are captured by the hated foe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/> They were congregated together in small rooms, (sized and appropriated for the purpose,) confined to their narrow limits closely, without sufficient room even to lie down compelled to drag out the wears days monotonously and starvingly &mdash; refused permission to speak even with their own officers captured with them; urged upon and influenced by every available agency to take the oath of allegiance to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States of America</placeName>; be retched by Abolition preachers with filthy harangues on the evils of slavery and the wrongs done the poor man by the rich, attempting thus to extinguish the fires of patriotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>Hunger, cruelty, and fanaticism were concentrated together to secure a cowardly advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>They were allowed nothing to eat, except such as was demanded for them by the captors from the citizens of <placeName reg="Oxford, Lafayette, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057155">Oxford</placeName>, to whom it was tauntingly said (after robbing their premises of all that could be found beforehand) that they ought to feed their his throne. </p> </q><bibl n="Jackson (Miss.)

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/> The citizens of <placeName reg="Oxford, Lafayette, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057155">Oxford</placeName> (where the prisoners were brought) experienced <unclear></unclear> she <unclear></unclear> or savage warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>Old citizens and woman were fired at in their own doors by the vandal soldiery.--Children were shot at in crossing the yard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>Houses were searched and desolated &mdash; relies of the past and absent were utterly shattered, and the sanctity of the family altar and fireside were invaded without the warning of a moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/>Finclosures were torn down and burned, and for <measure n="40miles" type="distance">forty miles</measure> around houses stood naked to the view, and cattle trampled where the rose bloomed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/> The prisoners were at last forwarded northward They were marched on foot <measure n="30miles" type="distance">thirty miles</measure>, to <placeName reg="Holly Springs, Marshall, Mississippi" key="tgn,2056637">Holly Springs</placeName>, without food of any sort till the next day. The treatment there was similar to that at <placeName reg="Oxford, Lafayette, Mississippi" key="tgn,2057155">Oxford</placeName> &mdash; probably worse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>And so through all the changes. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/> After being kept on the <placeName reg="Mississippi River" key="tgn,7022231">Mississippi river</placeName> <measure n="25days" type="date">twenty-five days</measure>, crowded to suffocation, half fed, and extorted upon even to the article of medicine, with disease and death around and among them, they were at last landed at the old State penitentiary at <placeName reg="Alton, Madison, Illinois" key="tgn,7015715">Alton, Illinois</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/>So gloomily did the prospect affect them that more than a <num value="100">hundred</num> plunged from the boat into the <rs>Mississippi</rs> in the dead of winter, and, amid volleys of musket bails sent after them, and the contending elements around them made their desperate way to shore, preferring to risk death to the prospect of the life before them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/> Their treatment at <placeName reg="Alton, Madison, Illinois" key="tgn,7015715">Alton</placeName> was inhuman and barbarous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>Hundreds were confined in the main building, which was open, break, and desolate, and so comfortless and dreary were the quarters that the open doors of the <unclear></unclear> calls were taken advantage of as at least affording some protection from the winter winds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>Men were compelled to remain in bed through the day because of no possible hope of warmth otherwise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/>They perished from neglect and cold.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>The smallpox, which was prevalent when they were brought there and thrown among it, swept them off by twenties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>Several days &mdash; from the <date value="01-20">20th of January</date> to the <date value="02-10">10th of February</date>--the deaths averaged <num value="15">fifteen</num> every <measure n="24hours" type="date">twenty four hours</measure>. A cumulated diseases of every shape fastened itself upon the exhausted system, and death was a matter of course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/>And even then the wooden coffin was but a mockery, for <num value="1">one</num> served for <num value="11">eleven</num> bodies, as seen and marked by a dozen witnesses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/>Earth was their only wrapping. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="141"/> The vermin, too, were terrible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="142"/>The hospitals were alive with the creeping mass, adding new horrors to the tormented sufferers, from which there was no relief. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="143"/> Men were dragged out on any pretext and confined for days in a dungeon, without food; and, with arms manacled and limbs shackled, could only wait in suffering the whimsical release of the prisoner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="144"/>It needed not the evidence of guilt to convict, nor even the charge of cooperative complicity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>The mere fact of abortive measures of escape by some sufficed to sentence all others that could be suspiciously connected with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/>The condition of release was the disclosure of plots to escape, which had never been made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/>The fact of prisoners being held by bayonets and stonewalls was ignored, and the prisoner was asked to hold himself and others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>He was asked to betray friends to enemies, or suffer with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>The dampness of the dunge on was preferable to this, and the penally paid without a murmur. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/> All articles of clothing not actually on the person were seized and held as contraband.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>This term was of extra ordinary extensiveness, which varied with the whims of the searcher.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>It was assumed to decide on the necessary amount of clothing requisite.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>The claimed surplus was retained.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="154"/>Men were even left threadbare of decent apparel.--<rs n="pocket knives" type="product">Pocket knives</rs> of the pan-blade order, were considered dangerous and held &mdash; and so were bibles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="155"/>Both were contraband. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="156"/> Money was seized and held, and only a part returned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="157"/>If it was attempted to be hid and was afterwards discovered by search, it was declared forfeited.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="158"/>The pretext was that it might be used to bribe sentinels. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="159"/> Prisoners were told threateningly of the improbability of exchange &mdash; the likelihood of extreme punishment &mdash; urged to take the oath and prejudiced by interest &mdash; and hundreds were thus influenced to do as was suggested.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="160"/>In short all that inhumanity, barbarity, crusty, cowardice and treachery could devise, were brought to bear to accomplish base purposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="161"/>The <unclear></unclear> of principle and dignity was degrading even to infamy. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>The usual <unclear></unclear> prelude to the grand struggle of the year has been most signally and gloriously in favor of the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.--It exhibited in many places with unabated force that skill in arms and stern determination of Southern men which have <unclear> red</unclear> us the victory up to this time, and repeatedly admonished our invaders that we were not to be subjugated by them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>This <unclear>auspicions</unclear> opening &mdash; the terrible reception given the enemy in his approaches by the water &mdash; maintains well the high confidence of the <rs>Southern</rs> people, and gives accurate of the triumphs that await our arms in the powerful conflicts which are no doubt soon to follow in the field. </p>
