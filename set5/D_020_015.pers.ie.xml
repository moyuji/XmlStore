<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> You will recollect, <persName n="Editors,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Editors,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs</roleName> <surname>Editors</surname></persName>, that in my last I stated, as a generally believed rumor, that the citizens around <placeName reg="Old Point, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,2557597">Old Point</placeName>, were forced into the <rs>Fort</rs> at the <rs>Point</rs> of the bayonet and made to take the oath of allegiance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>I could not then vouch for the truth of this rumor, though such conduct on the part of the vandals was perfectly characteristic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Since then, I have learned from an entirely reliable source, that what I stated as rumor, is literally true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>As soon as it was known at the <rs>Fort</rs> that the militia were to be called out, the redoubtable <rs>Butler</rs> sent out a large body of soldiers, who went from house to house at <time value="12am">midnight</time> and took every man and boy, forced them into the <rs>Fort</rs> and compelled them to take the oath or remain in prison.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>His treatment of <persName n="Ratcliffe,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Ratcliffe,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs</roleName> <surname>Ratcliffe</surname></persName> and <persName n="Israel,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Israel,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Israel</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Baltimore, Baltimore Independent City, Maryland" key="tgn,7013352">Baltimore</placeName>, fully explains how to influences our citizens <hi rend="italics">voluntarily</hi> to take the oath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/><q>&#x0022;No compulsion, no compulsion, sir,&#x0022;</q> is his cry.--Every thing of this sort must be voluntary. --But it is <q>&#x0022;take the oath or be hung as a spy;&#x0022;</q> <hi rend="italics">no compulsion,</hi> of course!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>The old tyrant tried the same game with some citizens of <placeName reg="Hampton, Hampton, Virginia" key="tgn,7013687">Hampton</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>In some cases he succeeded; in others he met with noble and patriotic refusals.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Among the latter, I understand, is old <persName n="Massenburg,Mister,George,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="default:Massenburg,George,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Massenburg</surname></persName>, who, on being required to take the oath, stood up and bared his aged bosom, and told the oppressor to shoot him, if he chose, for he would sooner die than take the oath.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/><rs type="role">Mr.</rs> M. is upward of <measure n="60years" type="date">60 years</measure> of age, and so infirm as generally to walk on crutches, yet I saw this old man, when the rumor was <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> started that the enemy were coming to <placeName reg="Hampton, Hampton, Virginia" key="tgn,7013687">Hampton</placeName>, take his double barrelled shot-gun, and, forgetful of his age and infirmities, walk down to the bridge and express his determination to drive back the foe or perish in the effort. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> Among others who have resisted threats and persuasions to force them to take the oath, are <persName n="Jones,Colonel,Wilson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="default:Jones,Wilson,,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <foreName>Wilson</foreName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName>, <persName n="Fowkes,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:Fowkes,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Fowkes</surname></persName>, and some others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>Such instances of true patriotism, on the part of men who are compelled by circumstances to remain among the enemy, are worthy of all praise. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> The losses of our citizens in the perishing of their crops and the loss of their negroes throughout <placeName reg="Elizabeth City, Pasquotank, North Carolina" key="tgn,2074494">Elizabeth City</placeName> and <persName n="Warwick,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Warwick,nomatch:0"><surname>Warwick</surname></persName> counties are beyond all calculation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>When <persName n="Greeley,,Horace,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="default:Greeley,Horace,,,"><foreName>Horace</foreName> <surname>Greeley</surname></persName> promulgated, as a part of the programme of the war, the liberation of the slaves and the general desolation of the country, many of us were incredulous as to the authorities at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> adopting such a course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>We looked upon it as mere gasconade on the part of the editor of the <hi rend="italics">Tribunes</hi> to frighten the <name>Southerners</name>, not supposing that the <name>Administration</name> would really condescend to anything so low and so characteristic of barbarism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>But facts have opened our eyes to the truth, that <persName><foreName>Horace</foreName></persName> was well posted in advance, and that there is no act of vandalism too mean for the powers at the once national capital to adopt or sanction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>The destruction of property, the insults repeatedly offered to ladies, the imprisonment of unoffending citizens, and the gross outrages offered to them while held in duress, have been so great and so continuous that except in actual butchery of women and children, it is doubtful whether the treachery and cruelty of Nana Sahib in <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName> have exceeded those that have been practiced by the <name>Northerners</name> since their invasion of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">lower</rs> Virginia</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/> Well, these things will open the eyes of our people, and show the true character of our foes, and the true object of this war. The cause is working out its legitimate effects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Hundreds and <num value="1000">thousands</num> of our citizens, who were earnest Union men, have by such means been changed to thorough and equally earnest Secessionists, and as the war progresses, the work will go on. Men will think and reason for themselves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>They will see that the object of the war is to compel them to have fellowship with their own destroyers; that in the <rs>Union</rs> that was, they must give their sanction to a war that has no other apparent object but to uphold a military despotism and legalize a system of indiscriminate plunder and destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Such a condition of things, too, must ultimately convince many, if not all the people of the <rs>North</rs> that, in carrying on the war, they must sanction and pray for what in their hearts they cannot but despise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>This influence will spread and increase, and when they fled their Government-loaded with a debt of <num value="5">five</num> or <num value="600000000">six hundred millions</num>, and their manufacturing and commercial interests utterly destroyed, and the moral influence of the civilized world arrayed against them, and the <rs>South</rs> still unsubdued &mdash; everything lost and nothing gained &mdash; will they not be brought to their senses, and cease to furnish the means of carrying on so unjust and profitless a warfare? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> From the present Congress at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> we have nothing to hope for. Let not the <rs>South</rs> be deceived at this point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>They will, doubtless legalize not only the palpable violations of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, confessed by the <name>Administration</name>, but no <num value="1">one</num> need to be surprised to see their <rs type="role2">President</rs> clothed with dictatorial powers, and authorized to go on with his work of plunder and destruction <hi rend="italics">ad libitum.</hi> The South, in the meantime, will go on, developing her own resources, manufacturing all she needs, and imbibing more and more the spirit of true and manly independence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/> I have just read <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abe,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s Message.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>To criticise such a tissue of misrepresentations of historic truths and such a combination of political sophistry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>I leave to school boys.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>It may not be amiss, however, to pause and make a little arithmetical calculation on the demand for <measure n="400000000dollars" type="currency">$400,000,000</measure> deemed necessary to carry on the war. Of course this money will have to be raised by loans.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Now, if <measure n="9000000dollars" type="currency">$9,000,000</measure> could not be had except at the ruinous discount of <num value="12">12</num> or <num value="0.15">15 per cent.</num>, and hardly at that, what capitalists in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> or <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> will invest their funds at any discount to the amount required by the <rs>President</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>The debt of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> is already about <measure n="200000000dollars" type="currency">$200,000,000</measure>; the present requisition will increase it to <measure n="600000000dollars" type="currency">$600,000,000</measure>. The interest on this will be, at <num value="0.06">six per cent.</num>, <measure n="36000000dollars" type="currency">$36,000,000</measure> Add to this the ordinary expenses of the <rs>Government</rs>, say <measure n="60000000dollars" type="currency">$60,000,000</measure>, and we have a continuous drain at least of <measure n="96000000dollars" type="currency">$96,000,000</measure>. Now the usual revenue of the <rs>Government</rs> even before the dissolution rarely if ever exceeded its expenses, <measure n="60000000dollars" type="currency">$60,000,000</measure>. Suppose that amount still to flow into their treasury, notwithstanding the <rs>Morrill Tarriff</rs> and the loss of that portion of the revenue which came by way of the <rs>Southern</rs> ports, we find a deficit of <measure n="36000000dollars" type="currency">$36,000,000</measure> to be met by direct taxation or to go unpaid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Can such an amount be raised?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>Will sober men submit to such double taxation for the name of a Union, which exists but in name?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>And will shrewd capitalists invest with such a prospect of losing both principal and interest? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/> I cannot but regard this financial feature of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abe,,,"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s scheme as <num value="1">one</num> eminently favorable to Southern independence, it being a virtual confession of the inability of the enemy to pursue his purpose of subjugation.

<head>Result of the levy en masse.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="169"/> The volunteer movement, which was responded to with so much liberality by <persName n="Richmond,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00047" reg="mostcommon:Richmond,nomatch:0"><surname>Richmond</surname></persName>, had reduced the working force engaged in every calling and branch of business to the most limited numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="170"/>The call for the body of the militia, would strip the business of the city of all the rest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="171"/>Nearly every storehouse would have to be closed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="172"/>Every workshop would be locked up. Every mill would cease to grind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="173"/>Every working machinist and every effective mechanic be called away from his useful and necessary occupation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/>The <rs>Banks</rs> would be closed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="175"/>The notes of the people due them would go unpaid and protested, and universal bankruptcy ensue.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>The notes of the <name>Banks</name>, the money of which the people have in their pock ets, might at any moment become worthless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="177"/>There would be no business and no currency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>The hotels and the restaurants would lose their supervisory force, and strangers would starve, or have to rob or steal their food.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>The market men would be taken away, and the people have to make what shift they could for their food. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/> The newspapers would loose all their operating force, and the people of the interior be left in total ignorance as to what is going on, and become the prey to every idle rumor that sweeps over the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>The condition of things in <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> would be repeated in every town and village of the North-side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/>But the case of the cities and towns would be fortunate compared with that of the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>It would be only material disaster that would fall upon the towns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>The calamity of the country would be moral and irreparable. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/> Every country mill would be stopped, and there would be a scarcity of bread.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>Almost every overseer would be taken from the custody of his charge; and negroes would run riot, and plantations would go to ruin.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>The crops which a bountiful <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName> has vouchsafed to a favored people would be lost by an act of improvidence, and what a benignant authority gives, an unbenignant <num value="1">one</num> take away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>The women of the country, who have been the most active patriots in this whole movement of resistance to aggression, would be made to feel in their feeble and delicate persons, to what horrid risks and dangers war may subject their sex. Great neighborhoods, teeming with slaves by the <num value="1000">thousand</num>, would be stripped of every available gun and effective man and left with none but women, with here and there a feeble old man or beardless boy, to administer its affairs and to protect its safety. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/> We have looked through the experience of the country in past wars, and we have not been able to find a single instance of a levy of the militia of a great region of country <hi rend="italics">en masse,</hi> before the present <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>It has been done in the instance of individual towns in a state of siege or in danger of imminent assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>In confined districts of country, embracing the extent of a single county, it has been done before the very presence of an enemy; but history does not furnish an example before the present <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="4" type="ordinal">fourth</num> part of a great Commonwealth and that a Commonwealth thickly populated with slaves, being called upon to drop all its industrial pursuits, to leave all its crops and fields unsecured, to remove all guards from its firesides and upon its slaves, and to march <hi rend="italics">en masse</hi> to the distant wars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>Whether this neglect in the past has been owing to a want of capacity in the <rs>Generals</rs> of the country, or to a want of statesmanship in its rulers, boots not; the thing is unprecedented and unheard of. If this immense mass of ill-armed militia should drive away the enemy, it would be a <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> blessing if on their return they should not find a worse desecration of household and field than that which they sought to avert by driving out the invader. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/> We have but <num value="1">one</num> counsel for the people in this grave and most singular emergency and that is, to obey their rulers, trusting to their own sober <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> thought for the rectification of any errors they may have fallen into.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>When the body of the militia shall have been enrolled, and when it shall be thus revealed, what countless harm, both to the peace interests and to the war interests of the country, would attend the indiscriminate marching of them off to distant fields; there will certainly be some expedient fallen upon of supplying with facility the wants of our armies without trenching upon the necessities of the great business interests of town and country.--Surely the capacity of our rulers is equal to the tack of supplying our want of material, so abundant are the demands of the war without destroying the industry of the country. </p> </div3>

<head>Foreign mercenaries.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/> It is now well known that the mass of the fighting men of the <name>Federalists</name> consists of foreigners, mostly <rs n="German" type="group">Germans</rs>, some of whom have been but a short time in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/><num value="1">One</num> of the wounded men at <placeName key="tgn,2044460;tgn,2016605;tgn,2036878" n="0.136 000000.8181	placename;tgn,2044460;bethel, oxford, maine,Oxford,Maine,United States,North and Central America;0.091 000000.5454	placename;tgn,2016605;bethel, fairfield, connecticut,Fairfield,Connecticut,United States,North and Central America;0.045 000000.2727	placename;tgn,2036878;north newton, harvey, kansas,Harvey,Kansas,United States,North and Central America" reg="bethel, oxford, maine,Oxford,Maine,United States,North and Central America;bethel, fairfield, connecticut,Fairfield,Connecticut,United States,North and Central America;north newton, harvey, kansas,Harvey,Kansas,United States,North and Central America">Bethel</placeName> stated to a <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> in our army that he had been but a month in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>He could not speak a word of <persName n="English,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00048" reg="mostcommon:English,nomatch:0"><surname>English</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>All the prisoners taken in the late affair near <orgName n="Newport News" type="newspaper">Newport News</orgName> are <rs n="German" type="group">Germans</rs>, and determined and truculent looking-fellows.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>Upon a late interview with a distinguished officer in our service, their spokesman expressed himself very freely and impudently; and the rest, if they were able to speak our tongue, were in too sullen a mood to employ it. From all quarters we hear of the preponderance of the <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> element in the invading army and the best fighting done on their side will be done by these men. The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are very glad to have such substitutes, and will not be very sorry if they never return, more demoralized than before by camp life, to become a source of torment and dread to those who have endowed them with their powers of mischief. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/> The foreign element in the armies of the enemy is <num value="1">one</num> which we ought not to under rate and against which we must exert all our vigilance and energy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/>At the same time, whilst they are dangerous enough to warn us from an excess of confidence, men who are fighting upon their own soil and in defense of their native land are more than a match for mercenary invaders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/>The <rs n="German" type="group">Germans</rs>, though a brave and constant people in defence of their own land, are not the most military of the <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> nations, as has been often demonstrated by the victorious legions of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 4" reg="france">France</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/>Strange that they who have often fought so bravely though unsuccessfully against invasion, should become invaders; that they who have so promptly dallied under every revolutionary flag that has been spread to the breeze in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, should as readily become the chief military instruments of a despotic power; that they who have found in this country a refuge from tyranny should seek to deprive the <rs>Southern States</rs> of their rights and liberties, States which &mdash; <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> at their head,--rolled back the tide of proscription against foreigners that was sweeping triumphantly over the whole <name>North</name>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>These remarks of course do not apply to the <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> population of the <rs>Southern States</rs>, who, in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName> and in some portions of our own Commonwealth, are among the most conspicuous and gallant champions of the <rs>Southern</rs> cause. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/> What a contrast does the <rs>Northern</rs> reliance upon foreign assistance present to the independent, self reliant attitude of the <rs>South</rs>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>The <rs>North</rs>, beasting that she numbered <num value="3">three</num> to <num value="1">one</num>, <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> looks anxiously to <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">England</placeName>, <placeName reg="France" key="tgn,1000070">France</placeName>, &#x0026;c., to give her aid and comfort against the <rs>South</rs>, and instead of fighting her own battles, makes up her rank and file principally of foreigners, while her own population are but sparsely represented.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>Yet, if she could conquer the <rs>South</rs>, she would claim it as a triumphant demonstration of the superior prowess of the <rs>Northern</rs> over the <rs>Southern</rs> people. </p> </div3>

<head>Reverses in war.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/> We must expect occasional reverses in war. We have never heard of a war yet in which the tide of victory was uninterrupted on either side, Certainly, if there ever was such a war, it was not the war of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>For <num value="7">seven</num> long, hard, dreary years, did the storm of battle roll above their heads, with alternate clouds and sunshine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/>The war began brilliantly, then the sky became chequered, then came some encouraging victory, to be followed by an overwhelming defeat, until at <num value="1">one</num> time, so deep was the surrounding gloom, scarcely a human being save <hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName></hi> retained confidence undiminished and hope undimmed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>His great, steadfast soul, like that of <hi rend="smallcaps"><placeName reg="Columbus, Hickman, Kentucky" key="tgn,2038271">Columbus</placeName>,</hi> saw land ahead when all others bad despaired, and by the inspiring power of his faith and courage turned midnight into day-dawn.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>But, undeniably, there never was a more disheartening war than that of the <name>Revolution</name>; destitute of money, and often of men, the whole land, in all its length and breadth, infested with tories, who were almost as implacable and unscrupulous as those of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919"><rs type="direction">Northwestern</rs> Virginia</placeName>; in our own ranks traitors like <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Arnold,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00049" reg="mostcommon:Arnold,nomatch:0"><surname>Arnold</surname></persName>,</hi> as bad a man as <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Carlile,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00050" reg="mostcommon:Carlile,nomatch:0"><surname>Carlile</surname></persName>;</hi> and large portions of the very population which had gotten up the war, that of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, unwilling to assist in carrying it on. <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Washington,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00051" reg="mostcommon:Washington,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName>,</hi> <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Greene,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00052" reg="mostcommon:Greene,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Greene</surname></persName>, </hi> that illustrious son of <placeName reg="Rhode Island" key="tgn,7007711">Rhode Island</placeName>, and other distinguished officers, bear testimony to the extreme and insurmountable difficulty of inducing the New Englanders to enlist in a war which they had gotten up for their own benefit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>All-over, our forces were mostly militia, commanded by inexperienced officers, and opposed by regular British and <rs n="Hessian" type="ethnic">Hessian</rs> soldiers, besides the tory levies and hostile <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indians</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>For years defeat, desertion, treachery and disappointment seemed the order of the day. But the cause was in the hands of men who had profound trust in <placeName reg="Providence, Providence, Rhode Island" key="tgn,7013952">Providence</placeName>, in the righteousness of their cause, and whose souls were even more remarkable for constancy and steadfastness than for a valor which was certainly never surpassed in history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>The successive reverses which they met were but opposing waves making the ship ride the ocean more bravely and buoyantly, or like gales which strip the oak of its dry foliage, but cannot lift it from its immovable roots. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/> The South has entered upon the present struggle under great disadvantages, and our only wonder is, when we consider the disparity of numbers, gold, and all the equipments and appliances for a state of war in the possession of the <rs>Federal Government</rs> and in working order, that we have been able to hold a single foot of ground in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/>When we consider the state of things before <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00053" reg="mostcommon:Lee,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName></hi> assumed the control of affairs, and the mighty energies of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Davis,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00054" reg="mostcommon:Davis,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName></hi> were brought personally in this quarter to the support of the war, we stand amazed at the amount which has been accomplished in so brief an interval.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>There was a time when the <rs>Federal Government</rs> could have struck a blow at <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName> which would have involved almost irreparable injury to the cause in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>But that time has passed by. Our rivers and estuaries, so long without a single battery for their protection, are now bristling with guns, which have beaten back the foe in every attempt he has made; the peninsula below us has become <num value="1">one</num> vast entrenched camp; the important position of <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, which seemed at <num value="1">one</num> time to invite attack, is now so strong that <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00055" reg="mostcommon:Scott,nomatch:0"><surname>Scott</surname></persName></hi> hesitates long, as well he may, before he attempts an assault; the <rs type="place">Navy-Yard</rs> at <placeName reg="Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia" key="tgn,7014231">Norfolk</placeName>, with its immense supply of arms, which might have been retaken by <num value="0.5">a half</num>- dozen regiments, is now impregnable; the <rs type="place">Valley</rs> is defended at <num value="1">one</num> extreme by <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Johnston,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00056" reg="nearbymention:Johnston,H.,E.,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Johnston</surname></persName></hi> and an army of force which the enemy dare not come out of his entrenchments to fight; and our only weak point is <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName>, which is weak because of the treason within it. Occasional reverses have their uses also, if we will turn their lessons to account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>They teach us the necessity of vigilance, of energy, of discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>They impress upon us the importance of always valuing an enemy at his own estimate of himself, if you would be sure of doing all that you can do to defeat and destroy him. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/> The war has thus far demonstrated that the enemy dare not attack us with anything like equal numbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>He must have at least <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num> to <num value="1">one</num> before he goes forth to win laurels which, gained under such circumstances, would be, to a sensitive brow, a diadem of thorns.--Even with those odds, he was overwhelmed at the <rs n="Battle of Bethel" type="battle">battle of Bethel</rs> by the most glorious and wonderful achievement in arms which this continent has ever witnessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>If Southern men had failed in a like enterprise; if <num value="5000">five thousand</num> Southern soldiers had attacked <num value="1200">twelve hundred</num> <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, and been repulsed with tremendous slaughter, whilst our opponents escaped with the loss of a single life, there might have been some reason for grumbling.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>But we cannot always expect to whip, in the proportion of <num value="1">one</num> to <num value="4">four</num> or <num value="5">five</num>, and we should not be discouraged if, before such odds, we sometimes fall back to a position where we shall have better luck next time. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/> The natural susceptibilities of a foreign nation are at all times worthy of respect. --Where any of our neighbors have reason to suppose that we have acted in an unfriendly or ungenerous manner towards them, or that their interests are likely to be affected disadvantageously by our acts, the opinion, though erroneous, deserves to be removed by explanations on our part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>It must be expected that nations will sometimes give way to groundless jealousy, and misinterpret the policy of others by viewing it as distorted by their own fears.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>In all such cases a frank and ready assurance of good intentions will never be withheld by the suspected State.--But in the present case the people of the <rs>Northern States</rs> have, without the shadow of reason, and in spite of manifold instances of courtesy and good will on our part, chosen to lash themselves into a fury, because we have taken the only course which was open to us, and declared our neutrality in a war between <num value="2">two</num> powerful, energetic and obstinate communities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>It cannot be supposed that they are ignorant of the reasons which compelled us to this course, for these are obvious to every <num value="1">one</num> who has any knowledge of international law and the laws of war; they have been plainly stated by <persName n="Russell,Lord,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00069" reg="default:Russell,John,,,"><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Russell</surname></persName>, in Parliament, and they have been laid down by <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> jurists in cases almost identical with the present. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/> Nor is there the least pretence for saying that apprehension has anything to do with the noisy attacks which are made upon us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>The reasons advanced by the <name>Northerners</name> to justify their indignation are only pretexts used to cover the real cause of it &mdash; namely, the wound which their vanity has suffered by our not having shown sufficient admiration of the levy made in obedience to <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00070" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Abe,,,"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s Proclamation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>This is the head and front of our offending.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>Our conduct in the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> civil war is before the world, and is so completely approved that it has been followed in every step by the <rs>French Government</rs>, and will, no doubt, be also followed by the other maritime States of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>The coarse invectives which fill the <rs>Northern</rs> papers may therefore continue; they will not be deprecated by us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>Yet the considerable forces which, if the newspapers speak truly, are being brought up from the <rs>South</rs>, render it likely that some more important battle will follow.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="886"/> <num value="1">One</num> day last week, <num value="3">three</num> of our watchful citizens happened to learn the whereabouts of an old well in the neighborhood, much caved at the sides and rather shallow, in which this night walker was said to make his lodgment by day. The fact having been confirmed to them by sufficient proof, the energetic trio field a <orgName n="War Council" type="council">council of war</orgName> immediately, and having supplied themselves with pistols, ammunition, knives, and <num value="2">two</num> or <num value="3">three</num> old horseman's a words, set out resolutely to surprise the daring villain in his <hi rend="italics">well</hi> selected den. And it was well they went prepared, as the sequel will show. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="887"/> <q>&#x0022;Fellows,&#x0022;</q> said the stout man of the party, when they were nearing the scene of action, <q>&#x0022;they say this bigger, or injun, or Abolitionist, whatever be is, stands <num value="6">six</num> foot in his stockings and <hi rend="italics">totes guns</hi> We had better stop and talk over this matter&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="888"/> Upon which the short man remarked, &#x0022;There's some of the boys in the village knows already we are gone to take him, for I happened to mention it, just before leaving; and how can we get around doing <hi rend="italics">something ?</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="889"/> <q>&#x0022;Well now,&#x0022;</q> said <num value="1">No. 1</num> <q>&#x0022;that's a poor way for you to go and do &mdash; to go and tell about it before we found out how things was&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="890"/> <q>&#x0022;Where's that tickler ?&#x0022;</q> suggested <num value="3">No. 3</num>, the small man of the concern; and having applied it vigorously to his lips to the extent of <num value="7">seven</num> or <num value="8">eight</num> long-metre guggles, continued, <q>&#x0022;By <persName><foreName>George</foreName></persName>, men, we must put the thing through somehow.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="891"/>So, here's for the thicket&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="892"/> Now, the well was in this thicket; and our <num value="3">three</num> armed knights advanced within its lonesome recesses in solid column, determined to act in unison, whatever might occur.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="893"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> movement after the well hove in sight gave evidence of their complete discipline in this respect; for no sooner had a stray cow rushed through the bushes, startled by their stealth by tread, than they simultaneously wheeled and unanimously retreated to the sun-shine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="894"/>But this would not do. The tickler had but <num value="1">one</num> more round aboard, and it was <q>&#x0022;now or never.&#x0022;</q> Bracing themselves for the rally, with everything drawn and cocked, they again advanced with closed ranks, and having approached within <measure n="15feet" type="distance">fifteen feet</measure> of the brink, cut spake <num value="1">No. 1</num>: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="895"/> <q>&#x0022;If you are in there, sir, it's no use to say no.&#x0022;</q> (Precisely what <num value="1">No. 1</num> meant by this affirmation, it is difficult to determine; but he became more intelligible as the ice gradually thawed) <q>&#x0022;You are here, sir, against the law, and you had better be leaving. &#x0022;</q> (An evident sound from the well at this moment drove the speaker to sudden desperation)--<q>&#x0022;We are armed with double barrel guns, and pistols, and <rs n="bowie knives" type="product">bowie- knives</rs>, and it's as much as your life's worth to lift your head out of that well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="896"/>Don't you do it, if you know what's for your own good.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="897"/> <q>&#x0022;Fell him,&#x0022;</q> hastily interjected <num value="2">No. 2</num>, <q>&#x0022;that there's a <num value="100">hundred</num> people out here&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="898"/> <q>&#x0022;Yes,&#x0022;</q> gathered up <num value="1">No. 1</num>, <q>&#x0022;there's <num value="200">two hundred</num> people close about, all around, every-where our here Nobody wants to hurt you, if you won't hurt us. So, put down your arms <hi rend="italics">friend,</hi> and say you give up.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="899"/> Another and a harsher sound from the well increased the excitement of the storming party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="900"/>They shouted, swore, cracked pine limbs, and in every possible way strove to convince the beleaguered <q>&#x0022;yaller man&#x0022;</q> that he was surrounded by over whelming odds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="901"/>The violent excess of their theatrical efforts, superadded to the several doses from the tickler, all taking effect at once, had brought our trio to the very verge of the well before they knew it. Suddenly silence possesses them &mdash; a tumult in the cavernous hiding place is again heard &mdash; it increases &mdash; it is surely coming up &mdash; arms and accoutrements are huddled together, and the word is half out, <q>&#x0022;every man take care of himself&#x0022;</q> --when lo ! the enemy cries aloud in <num value="3">three</num> several tremendous notes of surrender &mdash; bah ! bah ! bah ! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="902"/> Our reporter, who was in a dense cedar bush, not far off, saw but little more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="903"/>Something was said about the <q>&#x0022;d &mdash; d old goat,&#x0022;</q> and a mutual pledge was given never to mention the affair to anybody.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="904"/>The stout man complained of feeling sorter sick and said he <q> &#x0022;believed he would go home this near cut.&#x0022;</q> The small man said he would <q> &#x0022;go down the <rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creek</rs> and see if he couldn't catch a perch&#x0022;</q> <rs n="While 2">While No. 2</rs>, draining the last drop in the tickler, spied about to see if the coast was clear and took the road as boldly as if he had never heard a goat bleat in all his life. </p>
