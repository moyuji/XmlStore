<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> On <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> last, the fight was carried on with great energy, the forces of Carvajal, making some headway towards the main plaza, which is the decisive point.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>In all <rs n="Mexican" type="group">Mexican</rs> towns, the plaza is the main point of defence and attack; and while that is held, the assailants never consider themselves victorious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>In the instance now under consideration, <persName n="Garcia,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="nearbymention:Garcia,Monday,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Garcia</surname></persName> is the commander of the city forces, and his headquarters are on the main plaza of the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>His position is fortified by barricades across the streets leading into the square, and by breastworks upon the tops of the surrounding houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>By means of these barricades and breastworks, he has command of an entire block of buildings in every direction from the plaza, and as a matter of course, the assailants have not crossed the second street from the square. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> On the southeast corner of the block to the south of the plaza a new and spacious theatre was being built.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>This building <persName n="Garcia,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="nearbymention:Garcia,Monday,,,"><surname>Garcia</surname></persName> has fortified in the most formidable manner, having loop-holed the walls and having barricaded the streets on both sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The tops of all the houses adjacent are filled with sharpshooters to pick off stragglers, and to protect the battery (<num value="1">one</num> gun) below from assault.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>These defences effectually intimidate all charges, for if the assaulting party could even take the barricades, the sharp-shooters on the tops of the houses would kill all who had the temerity to attempt to hold the position.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>These sharp-shooters are out of danger, being stationed behind heavy brick parapets, loop-holed for musketry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/>Until the last <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure> her supremacy was undisputed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>Since the conquest of <placeName reg="California" key="tgn,7007157">California</placeName> and the discovery of its gold, a new power has spring suddenly into the advance, and dared to contest with her the precedence in resources and power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>For a while, this formidable rival bid fair to make its claim good.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>Suddenly civil disruption has paralyzed the young empire; and <num value="1">one</num> of the chief elements of its strength and wealth has seceded from the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/> The alliance of this seceding political power is as desirable to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> as its association was valuable to the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>The present opportunity offers <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> an ally more valuable than that of the whole <rs n="European" type="group">European</rs> continent, ensuring her predominance in the family of nations, and effectually humbling the pretensions and curbing the aspirations of her <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> rival. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/> <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> was obliged about this time, by some expedient or other, by means either fair or foul, to open the <rs>Southern</rs> ports for the exportation of cotton.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>Cotton was a necessity to her and to <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> so urgent as to override all calculations of loss and damage from war. If a sufficient cause of war had not been vouchsafed to her, she would have had to find <num value="1">one</num> by the exercise of diplomatic ingenuity, or manufacture, it to hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>A quarrel was necessary, even if there had been no apple of discord providentially dropped down in the path.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> themselves have furnished the desired grievance; and <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> loses not <num value="1">one</num> moment in making it the ground of demands as righteous as they are impossible of concession. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>But deeper causes and more general considerations conspire to insure collision at this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>However assured the <rs>South</rs> may feel of her ability to maintain her present movement for independence, that assurance is not felt to the same extent across the water.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>For <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> to stand still and witness the success of the <rs>North</rs> in establishing the integrity of its dominion on this Continent would have been virtually to consent to step down herself to a secondary rank among the leading powers of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/>With cotton and gold, and iron and coal, in unrivaled quantities and excellence, all at command, and its authority unquestioned within the vast boundaries which marked the domain of the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName> on this Continent, <measure n="5years" type="date">five years</measure> more of additional growth and multiplication would have given the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> power undisputed ascendency in the family of nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>Its very struggle with the <rs>South</rs>, if resulting in success, would have placed its power and prestige on an indisputable basis. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/> It is plain to all the world, it is palpable to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> herself, that the vital words for her are <q>&#x0022;strike now, or strike never.&#x0022;</q> It is the universal belief of mankind that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> has long been plotting the separation that has now taken place in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>; and that the present opportunity is <num value="1">one</num> for which she has been toiling with anxious care and industrious energy for half a century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>If this be true, it would be a piece of self-stultification to lose the golden opportunity that at last presents itself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>If, however, this charge against the far-reaching and all embracing statesmanship of that country be false, still the imperative impulse of self-preservation would drive her into war against the <rs>North</rs> at the present conjuncture.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>That the <rs>North</rs> and <rs>England</rs> are rivals in every single <num value="1">one</num> of their interests, is known to every man of reflection in both countries; and not to expect a collision when so fair an opportunity and so palpable an excuse presents itself as the present, would be to expect human nature to have changed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>Though this seemed to be regarded by the <rs>Consul</rs> as a matter of common duty, we were much impressed with the incident.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>It was a striking illustration of the paternal and patriarchal care which the <rs>British Government</rs> takes of the humblest of its subjects.
