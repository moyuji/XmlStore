<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/> Having participated in the <rs n="Battle of Sharpsburg" type="battle">battle of Sharpsburg</rs>, in various positions, for nearly the whole day, I have thought a brief history of the doings of that day, which came under my observation, would be interesting to your readers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>I take pleasure in giving them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> After the taking of <placeName reg="Harpers Ferry, Jefferson, West Virginia" key="tgn,7016154">Harper's Ferry</placeName>, <placeName reg="Jackson, Hinds, Mississippi" key="tgn,7016129">Jackson</placeName>'s old division, to which our battery is attached, under <orgName n="brigade"><persName n="Starke,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="mostcommon:Starke,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Starke</surname></persName>'s brigade</orgName>, was ordered to march, and, after marching from <time value="11oclock">11 o'clock</time> at night and crossing the <rs>Potomac</rs> during the day, we landed at the battle-field just at dusk, and as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> were driving in our pickets, and before we could get to our position, a terrific fire of shell was opened upon our brigade and batteries, which were then moving along slowly. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/> I will here premise and state that nearly all speak of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> line of battle as assuming the shape of a capital A, but my own impression was, that it was more in the shape of are, and our division was placed on the left, where the cross in the letter touches the left, enabling the enemy that evening to fire upon as from their <orgName n="Left Wing" type="wing">left wing</orgName>; but we held our position that night; but before it was light on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Wednesday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> they commenced a furious attack upon us from their right, driving us from the woods, and killing our brave General, <persName n="Starke,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00007" reg="mostcommon:Starke,nomatch:0"><surname>Starke</surname></persName>, after he had <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> charged bayonets, and driven them before him; but their immense masses at this point commenced pouring in by legions, when <num value="2">two</num> rifle guns, under <persName n="Brockenborough,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Brockenborough,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Brockenborough</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Rock Bridge, Sumner, Tennessee" key="tgn,2623271">Rock bridge</placeName>, commander of the <orgName n="Baltimore Artillery" type="artillery">Baltimore artillery</orgName>, and <num value="2">two</num> under <persName n="Raine,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Raine,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Raine</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Lynchburg, Lynchburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7013981">Lynchburg</placeName>, commander of the <orgName n="Lee battery" type="battery">Lee battery</orgName>, were ordered to take a position on an eminence near the infantry, and as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> hosts were driving our infantry <num value="3">three</num> of these guns opened upon the advancing <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> with canister in rapid succession, mowing them down, and broke their lines, though they were then advancing in <num value="3">three</num> columns, about <measure n="300yards" type="distance">300 yards distant</measure>. This check enabled us to hold the position until reinforcements &mdash; consisting of <persName n="McLaws,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:McLaws,nomatch:0"><surname>McLaws</surname></persName>'s and <orgName n="divisions"><persName n="Walker,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Walker,nomatch:0"><surname>Walker</surname></persName>'s divisions</orgName> &mdash; came up, when, in turn, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> gave way, never to recover the ground during the day. This was the place they massed their forces, (near the centre,) so as to cut us in twain, but were foiled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>About this time the largest number of our forces were engaged, and I believe, including <orgName n="corps"><persName n="Longstreet,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Longstreet,nomatch:0"><surname>Longstreet</surname></persName>'s corps</orgName> on our right, that we had engaged actively in the fight more than <num value="50000">50,000</num> men at <num value="1">one</num> time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>I have heard that only a few brigades fought at a time, coming up to relieve each other, but being myself near the centre, and looking around, I could see nearly the whole battle-field, which was probably <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> long, but being in the shape mentioned above was easy to survey with the naked eye. The cannonading was terrific and incessant, and battery after battery would fire until it exhausted its ammunition, when it would retire for others to take its place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>' shell would burst incessantly among our men, but no step was taken backwards. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> guns fired by any <num value="1">one</num> that morning were on the left, and from the <orgName n="Lee battery" type="battery">Lee battery</orgName>, (howitzers,) and the enemy were driven back.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>They made a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> charge, and were gallantly repulsed by the <orgName n="Stonewall Brigade" type="brigade">Stonewall brigade</orgName>, under <persName n="Grigsby,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Grigsby,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Grigsby</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> We succeeded in driving the enemy from his positions on our left; but our right did not succeed so well, and the rival forces seemed to be waging about an equal contest at that point, if our's was not wavering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>About this time, which was between <time value="1">one</time> and <time value="2oclock">two o'clock</time>, I was ordered, with several other batteries under the charge of <persName n="Stewart,General,J.,E.,B.," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="default:Stewart,J.,E.,B.,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <foreName>J.</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <foreName>B.</foreName> <surname>Stewart</surname></persName>, on the extreme left, so as to drive the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> from a position which our forces had vainly tried repeatedly to do several times before.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>With a great army completely beaten and demoralized, it is painful to find the defeated General fabricating portentous estimates of the amount of men his conquerors must have lost in beating him.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>At <time value="11oclock">11 o'clock</time> at night the infantry and artillery took up their line of march and reached the cavalry in front of <placeName key="tgn,2056685" n="1.000 104" reg="iuka, tishomingo, mississippi">Iuka</placeName> at about <time value="8am">eight in the morning</time>.--Preparations were at once made to storm the place, and our forces charged, but into an empty garrison; for the enemy had evacuated under cover of night.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>This caused great disappointment to our men, as it was expected the whole <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> garrison would have been captured.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="801"/> This able document, my boy, pleased me greatly, as an evidence that the war had indeed commenced in earnest; and though, at that moment, I beheld some half a dozen Confederates ransacking the tent, where the <rs>General</rs> kept his mortgages, his bank account, and other Government property, I felt that our foes were about to be summarily dealt with at last. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="802"/> An orderly having finally given notice to the <name>Confederacies</name> rummaging within our lines to get to their proper places, in order that the battle might begin, the <rs>Anatomical Cavalry</rs>, under <persName n="Smith,Captain,Samyule,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00447" reg="default:Smith,Samyule,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>Samyule</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>, made a headlong charge upon a body of foes who were destroying a bridge near the middle of the field, and succeeded in obliging them to remain there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="803"/>This brilliant movement was the signal for a general engagement, and a regiment of Confederacies at once advanced within our lines and inquired the way to <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="804"/> Having given them the desired information, and allowed a number of other similar regiments to take a position between the <name>Mackerels</name> and the capital, the <rs>General</rs> gave orders for the <rs>Conic Section</rs> and the <placeName reg="Orange, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002177">Orange County</placeName> Howitzers to fall cautiously back, in order that the remaining Confederacies might get between us and <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="805"/> You will perceive that by this movement, my boy, we cut the enemy's force completely in <num value="2">two</num>, thus compelling him to attack us either in front or in the rear, and giving him no choice of any other operation save flank movements.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="806"/>Our plans being thus perfected, <persName n="Brown,Captain,William,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00448" reg="default:Brown,William,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>, with Company <num value="3">3</num>, Regiment <num value="5">5</num>, was ordered to charge into a wood near at hand, with a view to induce some recently arrived reserve Confederates to take a position in our centre, while still others would be likely to flank us on the right and left. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="807"/> You may remember, my boy, that it has hitherto been our misfortune to fight on the circumference of a circle, while the <rs>Confederacy</rs> had the inside; and this great strategic scheme was intended to produce a result <hi rend="italics">vice versa.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="808"/> It was a great success, my boy &mdash; a great success; and our troops presently found themselves inside the most complete circle on record.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="809"/><persName n="Brown,,William,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00449" reg="default:Brown,William,,,"><foreName>William</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName> not only charged into the wood, but staid there; and when <num value="1">one</num> of the <placeName reg="Orange, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,2002177">Orange county</placeName> Howitzers was discharged with geat precision at a reporter who was caught sneaking into our lines, the report was heard by the <rs>Venerable Gammon</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, causing that revered man to telegraph to all the papers, that no <num value="1">one</num> need feel alarmed, as he was perfectly safe, and that our victory was complete. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="810"/> What particular danger the <rs>Venerable Gammon</rs> had incurred, I can't say, my boy; nor what he knew about the battle; but his dispatch caused renewed confidence all over the country, and was a great comfort to his friends. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="811"/> Having got the <name>Confederacies</name> just where he wanted them, the <rs>General</rs> of the <rs>Mackerel Brigade</rs> now dispatched <num value="10">ten</num> veterans under <persName n="O'Pake,Sergeant,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00450" reg="mostcommon:O'Pake,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Sergeant">Sergeant</roleName> <surname>O'Pake</surname></persName> to attack a few <num value="100">hundred</num> foes who had entrenched themselves in an unseemly manner right among our wagons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="812"/>The Mackerels were well received as prisoners of war and paroled on the spot; a proceeding which so greatly pleased the idolized General that he at once issued this <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>. </p> </div4> 
<div4 type="entry" n="4"> 
<head>Proclamation.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="813"/> It must be understood that in his recent proclamation, directing the <rs>Mackerel Brigade</rs> to dine exclusively upon Southern Confederacies, the <rs>General</rs> commanding did not intend that such dining should take place without the free consent of such Confederacies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="814"/> It must not be understood that the order concerning the confiscation of Confederate garments is intended to authorize a forcible confiscation of such costume, in opposition to the free will of the wearers. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="819"/> And now, my boy, occurred that magnificent piece of generalship which is destined to live forever on the annals of fame, and convince the world that our military leaders possess a genius eminently fitting every <num value="1">one</num> of them for the next Presidency, or any other peaceful office.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="820"/>By skillful man&#x0153;uvering, the gifted General of the <rs>Mackerel Brigade</rs> had succeeded in cutting the enemy's forces to paces, the pieces being mixed up with our own army. --Then came the words, <q>&#x0022;Forward, double quick!&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="821"/> Facing toward <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, our vanguard forced the <name>Confederacies</name> before them to move right ahead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="822"/>Swiftly following the vanguard, and evidently fancying it was flying before them, came a regiment of Confederacies.--Pursuing the latter, as though in triumph, appeared the <rs>Conic Section</rs>, Mackerel Brigade; closely succeeded in its turn by a regiment of Confederacies in charge of our baggage-wagons; racing after whom was a regiment of Mackerels, and so on to the end of the line. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="823"/> You may ask, my boy, with which side rested the victory in this remarkable movement? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="824"/> That question, my boy, cannot be decided yet, as the whole procession has scarcely reached <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>; but, the answer may be said to depend very much upon whether the last regiment coming in is Mackerel or Confederacy. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="825"/> The contest, my boy, has assumed a profound metaphysical aspect, and the development of a little more military genius on our side will tend to utterly confound our enemies &mdash; and everybody else. </p>
