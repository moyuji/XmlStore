<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The general health of this company is excellent, and, indeed, the condition of all the different companies in and about the city, in regard to health, is as good as could be expected in almost any part of the world. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> The number of deaths among the troops stationed here has been very small, comparatively, and much less, I believe, in proportion to the number of men in camp than has been reported in other parts of the <rs>State</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>It appears that some of the regiment, who possess superior musical genius, have formed a singing club for their mutual pleasure, and for the purpose of relieving the monotony of camp life; and, having made considerable progress, have laudably determined upon the plan above mentioned to aid the ladies in their noble and assiduous effort in behalf of sick and needy soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>The tender of their services has been accepted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>The arrangements are being made for the musical treat, and the worthiness of the object will no doubt insure a large attendance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Considerable time has elapsed since there was any public entertainment here, owing, of course, to the warlike demonstrations which have engrossed the heart, mind and talent of the country. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="617"/>When the firing ceased the fort was occupled in force and held afterwards. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="618"/> The <rs>Monticello</rs> had proceeded ahead of the land force to protect them, and had reached the inlet, when a large fort, of an octagon shape, to the rear and right of the small battery, mounting <num value="10">ten</num> <num value="32">thirty-two</num>'s and <num value="4">four</num> <measure n="8inch" type="distance">8-inch</measure> guns, which till then had been silent, opened on her with <num value="8">eight</num> guns at short range.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="619"/>At the same instant she got aground and stuck fast, the enemy pouring in a fire, hot and heavy, which the <rs>Monticello</rs> replied to with shell sharply.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="620"/>For <measure n="50minutes" type="date">fifty minutes</measure> she held her own, and finally getting off the ground she came out, having been shot through and through by <num value="7">seven</num> <measure n="8inch" type="distance">8-inch</measure> shell, <num value="1">one</num> going below the water line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="621"/>She fired <num value="55">fifty-five</num> shell in <measure n="50minutes" type="date">fifty minutes</measure>, and partially silenced the battery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="622"/>She withdrew at dusk for repairs, with <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> men slightly bruised, but none killed or wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="623"/>The escape of the vessel and crew was miraculous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="624"/>Until this time we supposed the day was ours; but the unexpected opening of the large battery rather changed the aspect of affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="625"/>Things did not look cheerful at dark.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="626"/>We had men ashore who were probably in need of provisions, and in case of a night attack no assistance could be sent them from the <rs type="place">Harriet Lane</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="627"/> As we lay close in shore we saw the bright bivouac fires on the beach, with groups of men about them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="628"/>The night passed without an alarm, the enemy, as we have since learned, lying on their arms at night, expecting an attack. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="629"/> At early daybreak on Thursday the men went to quarters in the fleet, and at <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> past <num value="8">eight</num>, the vessels having borne down nearer than the previous day's position, the action began, the <rs>Susquehanna</rs> opening the day's work by a shell from <num value="1">one</num> of the <measure n="11inch" type="distance">11-inch</measure> guns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="630"/>The <rs>Minnesota</rs> and <rs>Wabash</rs> joined in immediately, and again the hum of shell and their explosion were heard.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="631"/>They fired nearly half an hour before the battery responded, when it answered briskly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="632"/>Our fire was more correct than on the previous day. The range had been obtained, and nearly every shot went into the battery, throwing up clouds of sand, and exploding with terrific effect. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="633"/> At <time value="10:25">twenty five minutes past ten</time> the <rs type="place">Harriet Lane</rs> opened fire, and soon after the <rs>Cumberland</rs> came in from the offing and joined in the attack.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="634"/>The <rs type="place">Harriet Lane</rs>, with her rifled guns, did good execution, several projectiles from the <measure n="8inch" type="distance">eight-inch</measure> shell going into the battery, and <num value="1">one</num> going directly through the ramparts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="635"/>The fire was so hot that all who could do so got into a bomb-proof in the middle of the battery. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="642"/>Mean while the <rs>Minnesota</rs> and <rs>Wabash</rs>, the latter having in tow the <rs>Cumberland</rs>, steamed down towards the inlet, and took their positions at long range, off from a sand battery at its mouth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="644"/> This was quickly followed by a <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> and <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num> heavy gun, and the shells could be seen bursting high above the battery, leaving a white balloon-like cloud of smoke, and sending their fragments like hail upon them below.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="645"/>Immediately the <rs>Minnesota</rs> opened fire, followed instantaneously by the <rs>Cumberland</rs>, the reports of the guns following in quick succession, and the shells exploding in, near, and above the battery, till the atmosphere was dense with smoke, and the battery itself hidden from our view.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="646"/>With a glass I could plainly see the white puffs of smoke that denoted the bursting shell at the battery, and as the wind would sometimes drift away the blue vell that obscured and covered the ships and battery, we could see the shell tearing through the ramparts of the battery, and bursting with terrific effect in it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="647"/> The scene presented while all the frigates were pouring a scorching fire of shot and shell upon the battery, was such as is seldom witnessed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>The lightning gleam of the guns, as they hurried the death-dealing shot; the sharp, heavy report of the explosion; the hum of the shell and the whiz of the shot, followed <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> by clouds of dust and loud explosions, when the shells scattered their deadly fragments about them, and occasionally the sharp report of guns returning fire from the fort.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>All this heightened by the dense blue smoke that drifted in clouds before us, made up such a scene as was never before witnessed on this coast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>After the cannonading had been going on about <measure n="2hours" type="date">two hours</measure>, the <term type="ship">steam frigate</term> <rs type="ship">Susquehanna</rs> came from sea, dropped her boats astern, and joined in the fray.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>A long time after the enemy had ceased to give us a gun the firing on our part ceased, and the <rs>Commodore</rs>, thinking that the rebels had been driven out, ordered the <rs>Monticello</rs> to follow up the advance of our troops along the beach, and protect them if fire should be opened upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>As she advanced towards the inlet, the troops entered and occupled the vacant battery, and again the <orgName n="Stars and Stripes" type="newspaper">Stars and Stripes</orgName> were hoisted, and floated, as it would seem, triumphantly in the breeze. </p>
