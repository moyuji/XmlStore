<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> Throughout the city yesterday the greatest excitement prevailed in relation to the news from <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Forts Moultrie</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Sumter</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>As early as <time value="8oclock">eight o'clock</time> in the forenoon the rumors of the destruction of the former of these military posts, and the occupation of the latter by the forces of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, were circulated.--It was at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> currently reported and believed, that <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Fort Moultrie</placeName> had been laid in ruins; that the guns were spiked, and the carriages, &#x0026;c, together with the barracks, burned, and that the post had been entirely abandoned.--The reports spread like wild fire, and soon gained currency in every part of the city.--Crowds of citizens anxiously inquired of each other the latest intelligence in retention to the affair, squads collected on every corner of the streets, and in front of the public resorts, to canvass the subject. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> The newspaper offices were besieged, the hotel halls were thronged, and even the grave and serious gentlemen composing the <orgName n="State Convention" type="convention">State Convention</orgName> shared in the general excitement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>On all hands anger and indignation was expressed at the supposed perfidious conduct of the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities, at whose instance it was at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> thought the movement was made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>The people were greatly incensed at the idea of a wilful breach of those assurances of non-action which had been volunteered by the <rs>Government</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and upon which so much reliance and confidence had been placed by the entire population that every impulse to take the necessary precautions for their own safety had been restrained. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> Instinctively men flew to arms.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> All the military forces thus ordered out promptly obeyed the summons, and the streets were soon enlivened by the appearance of individual members of the different organizations in their uniforms. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> About noon the excitement in the streets had attained the highest pitch.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>The Convention was known to be in secret conclave, and it was believed that this was the subject matter of their deliberations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>The streets swarmed with people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Additional flags were displayed from the stores and houses on the principal streets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>The Custom-<persName n="House,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:House,nomatch:0"><surname>House</surname></persName>, and other buildings formerly in the possession of the <orgName n="U.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>Every <num value="1">one</num> looked upon the &#x0022;war as actually begun,&#x0022; and all seemed to feel that their brethren were in the field, and themselves began to grow restless at the prospect of inactivity and suspense. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> Later in the day, however, the excitement was somewhat abated, when it became known that the movement on the part of the forces of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> at <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Fort Moultrie</placeName> was not at the instance of the <name>Administration</name> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, but was merely a precautionary measure taken by <persName n="Anderson,Commander,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Anderson,B.,,,:1"><roleName n="Commander">Commander</roleName> <surname>Anderson</surname></persName>, under conviction that his position within the fortress on <placeName reg="Sullivanis Island">Sullivanis Island</placeName> would not be tenable, if attacked in it by well organized and disciplined troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>The contradiction of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> reports in relation to the damage done the fort by the troops that had evacuated it, also had a tendency to allay the excitement of the occasion. </p> </div4>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> In order to ascertain truthful statements of the actual damage done to the <rs>Forts</rs>, of the causes of the movement, and of the state of affairs generally, reporters were dispatched to the scene during the forenoon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>On the way across the harbor, the hoisting of an <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> flag from the staff of <placeName key="tgn,2335552" n="1.000 10" reg="Fort Sumpter, Baker, Oregon">Fort Sumpter</placeName>, at precisely <time value="12oclock">12 o'clock</time>, gave certain indication that the stronghold was occupied by the troops of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>On a nearer approach the fortress was discovered to be occupied, the guns appeared to be mounted, and sentinels were discovered on duty, and the place to give every sign of occupancy and military discipline.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/>The grim fortress frowned defiance on every side &mdash; the busy notes of preparation resounded through its unforbidden recesses, and everything seemed to indicate the utmost alacrity in the work on hand. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> Turning towards <placeName key="tgn,2335409" n="1.000 25" reg="fort moultrie, charleston, south carolina">Fort Moultrie</placeName>, a dense cloud of smoke was seen to pour from the end facing the sea.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> In the immediate vicinity of the rear or land side entrance, however, greater activity was noticeable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>At the time of our visit, a large force of hands had been summoned to deliver up their implements for transportation to <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Around on every side were the evidences of labor in the fortification of the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>In many places, a portion of the defences were strengthened by every appliance that art could suggest or ingenuity devise; while, in others, the uncompleted works gave evidences of the utmost confusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>On all hands the process of removing goods, furniture and munitions, was yet going on. The heavy guns upon the ramparts of the <rs>Fort</rs> were thrown down from their carriages and spiked.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/> This is the last day of the year <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>--a year which, we are disposed to think.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>future ages will reckon among the most memorable of history.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>In thinking over its agitating events, we are irresistibly carried back a century, and we <sic>are are</sic> almost started to see how different the world is now from what it was then.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/>It has been said a century is a small period in the life of a nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>Perhaps it may be so. But with nations as with men, there are <num value="2">two</num> ways of living; a fast way and a slow way. At some periods of their existence, men live more in a week than they do during a period of <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> at others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>Thus it is with nations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>They pass, sometimes, whole centuries in a species of vegetating existence, between sleeping and waking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>Nothing seems to agitate them, nothing to rouse them from their slumbers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="400"/><num value="1">One</num> such period as this in the history of the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> Empire is alluded to by <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Gibbon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00165" reg="mostcommon:Gibbon,nomatch:0"><surname>Gibbon</surname></persName>, </hi> who observes that the happiest ages of mankind are those which afford the least material for history; and so they are, if history be the mere record of siege and battle, of assault without provocation, and murder under color of law, which we have been taught to believe it is, and which it seems to be, since it is a record of little else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="401"/>But during those quiet, silent ages, materials for a conflagration are always accumulating &mdash; mischief is always brewing &mdash; the devil is always roaming the earth &mdash; and at last comes an explosion, to prove that Peace Societies are farces, that <placeName reg="Colorado" key="tgn,7007158">Col.</placeName><hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Napier,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00166" reg="mostcommon:Napier,nomatch:0"><surname>Napier</surname></persName>'s </hi> position is true, and that war is the normal state of man. Nothing can prevent it. If beset by calamity, nations vent their wrath on their neighbors &mdash; if wallowing in prosperity and waxing fat, they are sure to kick.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>Every state and condition of society is opposed to peace, else why is the wisdom of statesmen always taxed to the very extent of their capacities to preserve its Why is it so easy always to get up a war, when it is so hard to preserve the peace?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>Why must a man, if he wish to be a good man, live in a state of eternal war with himself?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="404"/>Why does he find it so easy to be a bad man, if he feel inclined. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/> Eras stand out like islands in that part of the ever-rolling flood of Time which has passed by us forever, and become lost in the ocean Eternity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="406"/>We stand upon the last sand on the beach of <dateStruct value="1860--"><year reg="1860">1860</year></dateStruct>, and look over the gulf that flows between us and <dateStruct value="1760--"><year reg="1760">1760</year></dateStruct>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="407"/>It appears near to us, because we measure not the breadth of the waters, but fix our eyes directly upon the object, not a very distant period.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>Yet we see a world so strange and so different from that in which we live, that it appears to belong to another planet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>Instead of a mighty nation, holding rank with the most powerful of the earth, we behold a few scattered settlements, along a thin slip of land bordering the <rs>Atlantic</rs>, peopled by about <num value="2000000">two millions</num> of inhabitants, who owe allegiance to a power that lies beyond the great waters of the deep.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>Occasionally we see a town struggling into the respectability of city hood, and a few villages assuming the importance of towns.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/>We see a courier arrived about once a week at this goodly hamlet of <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 4" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>, and we hear of a vessel at <placeName reg="City Point, Virginia, Virginia" key="tgn,2240477">City Point</placeName>, <measure n="6weeks" type="date">six weeks</measure> out from the old country, with a cargo to suit the market, and a few newspapers to give the planters assurance that the world outside is still alive Perhaps a post- boy arrives from the seat of the <rs type="place">Royal</rs> government, <placeName reg="Williamsburg, Williamsburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014629">Williamsburg</placeName>, with the last <hi rend="italics">Gazette,</hi> and the denizens of the hamlet eagerly crowd to hear the news.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="432"/>He listens in solemn and decent attention; he becomes agitated; his eyes glisten; his hands stretch nervously; his lips quiver; he bursts into tears; his whole frame is convulsed; he yields to a wild and uncontrollable passion of grief!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="433"/>Who is that young man!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="434"/>He must be something more than ordinary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="435"/>No man ever yet possessed such susceptibility of powerful emotions, without being capable of rousing them in others. &#x0022;If you want me to weep,&#x0022; says the <rs n="Roman" type="ethnic">Roman</rs> poet, &#x0022;you must weep yourself.&#x0022; What is that man?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="440"/> Alas! that young man is none of these.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="441"/>It is doubtful whether he will ever be able to take care of himself, far less to control others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="442"/>He has an incurable repugnance to everything useful.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="443"/>He will not attend to any kind of business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="444"/>He is idle, beyond all endurance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="445"/>Set him up in business, and the probability is he will fail in a week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="446"/>He delights in nothing so much as lying by the side of a mill-pond with a hook and line in the water, to all appearance watching his corks, yet never catching any fish, and perhaps not caring whether he catches any or not. To vary his sport, he takes to the woods, when the fishing season is over, and though we never hear of his killing a deer, yet his gun is eternally on his shoulder, and he apparently loves the wild woods as much as an <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="447"/>As if to show how many contradictions may be inclosed in the same character, he is fond to excess of attending all crowds and gatherings of men. He will do anything, in fine, but attend strictly to business.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/> The capitulation of <placeName reg="Pekin, Tazewell, Illinois" key="tgn,2029611">Pekin</placeName> to an Allied force of <name>French</name> and <name>English</name> has been announced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>There was no fighting except in taking the summer palace of the <rs>Emperor</rs>, which is about <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure> outside of the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>This was taken by the <rs>French</rs>, who <measure n="2" type="killed">killed two</measure> out of <num value="20">twenty</num> men defending it. A letter says: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="760"/> No description can give an idea of the splendor of this residence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="761"/>The entrance or reception hall is paved with marble, and painted with gold, azure, and scarlet, in the most gorgeous style.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/>The throne of the <rs>Emperor</rs> is of beautiful carved dark wood, and the cushions, embroidered with gold dragons, attracted general admiration; every inner chamber and saloon was very handsomely fitted up, and the rolls of silk, satin and crapes, all of splendid workmanship, splendidly furnished cummerbunds and puggarees for the <rs>French</rs> soldiers, who appear to have adopted our custom in this respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/>The jade stone and china were of great value, and some Series china of <persName n="Quatorze,,Louise,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00511" reg="default:Quatorze,Louise,,,"><foreName>Louise</foreName> <surname>Quatorze</surname></persName> would have delegated the eyes of many a curio fancier; and a presentation sword, with the <rs>English</rs> coat of arms, studded with gems, and evidently of antiquity, gave rise to some speculation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/>The last treaty of Tien-tein was also found, and the immense quantity of foot of all kinds made it almost impossible to know what to take away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="765"/>Some idea of the quantity of silk may be given by the fact that fowls, old pots, &#x0026;c., were wrapped in the most costly silks and satins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/>All the ladies had disappeared, but their little Japanese dogs, something resembling <persName><roleName n="King">a King</roleName> <foreName>Charles</foreName></persName> spaniel, were running about in a distracted state. </p> </q><bibl n="a letter"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/> The public reception hall, the state and private bedrooms, ante-rooms, boudoirs, and every other apartment, has been ransacked; articles of vertu, of native and foreign workmanship, taken, or broken if too large to be carried away; ornamental lattice work, screens, jade stone ornaments, jars, clocks, watches, and other pieces of mechanism, curtains and furniture &mdash; none have escaped destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="768"/>There were extensive wardrobes of every article of dress &mdash; coats richly embroidered in silk and gold thread, in the imperial dragon pattern; boots, <rs n="head dresses" type="product">head-dresses</rs>, fans, &#x0026;c.; in fact, rooms all but filled with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>Store- rooms of manufactured silk in rolls, such as may be bought in <placeName reg="Canton, Stark, Ohio" key="tgn,7013537">Canton</placeName> at <measure n="20dollars" type="currency">$20</measure> to <measure n="30dollars" type="currency">$30</measure> per piece.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>By a calculation made in the rooms, there must have been <num value="70000">70,000</num> or <num value="80000">80,000</num> pieces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>Hundreds were thrown down and trampled on, and the floor covered thickly with them, men were throwing them at each other, and all taking as many as they could carry.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/>They were used instead of rope to secure the loading of carts filled with them.--Throughout the <rs>French</rs> camp were hundreds of pieces, some heaped up, others used to make tents, or beds and coverlets. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/> In the afternoon yesterday, a party of French went through the apartments with sticks, breaking everything that remained &mdash; mirrors, screens, panels, &#x0026;c. It is said that they did so in revenge for the barbarous treatment the released prisoners, their countrymen, had received. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/> A treasury containing a large quantity of gold ingots and sycee silver, is under charge of a guard, and is to be divided between the <rs>English</rs> and <rs>French</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/> The total of property destroyed would amount to a large installment of the indemnity claimed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/> In <num value="1">one</num> of the ante-rooms of the state bedroom at the summer palace, the treaty of Tien-tein, in English and <placeName key="tgn,1000111" n="1.000 10" reg="Zhonghua,Asia">Chinese</placeName>, signed by <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Elgin</foreName></persName>, was found.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>It had been thrown on the ground by some <num value="1">one</num>, and lay in the heap of broken articles, till the <rs>English</rs> paper evidently attracted the eye of the person who discovered it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/> A <rs n="General Order" type="misc">general order</rs> from the <rs>British</rs> <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs> desired that all articles taken by officers and men were to be sent in for sale by public auction for the benefit of the army, which was done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>All were permitted to have the articles they had brought away for themselves valued, and have the option of taking or rejecting them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>Many beautiful curios and souvenirs were thus obtained at a nominal price.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>The sale realized <measure n="22000dollars" type="currency">$22,000</measure>, which, with the value of the treasure, estimated at <measure n="61000dollars" type="currency">$61,000</measure>, is to be divided as prize money on the spot. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="782"/> The <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs> and general officers have waved their right to share.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="783"/>A gold jug, of great value, was presented to the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander-in-Chief</rs> by the army.
