<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Yes, there are signs of peace, but not humanity and reason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The authors and managers of the war were lost to those virtues long before the war began.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>Peace, when it comes, will come in spite of them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>They will fight against it, plot against it, and abandon the field of blood only when forced by inexorable necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>That point cannot be far off. They cannot get on much further without an amount of money it will be impossible to raise by the system of fraud and deception, which appears to be the only means comprehended by the <name>Administration</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> He begins to understand that his paper balloon is in danger of collapsing at any moment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>To-day the debt is beyond the reach of the real money.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Even the <orgName n="New York Tribune" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi></orgName>, of a late issue was forced to confess that the people begin to fear that <hi rend="italics">repudiation is only a question of times.</hi> The <orgName n="New York Times" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Times</hi></orgName>, moved by a spirit of intelligence and candor quite unaccountable, warned the <name>Administration</name> that it must not hope to mortgage the property of the people to the <rs>Government</rs> <hi rend="italics">without final repudiation of the whole debt.</hi> Even those blind organs can see that the popular confidence begins to falter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>In competency and dishonesty in the management of public funds have run the ship of State almost ashore.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>An army of plunderers has assailed the treasury <num value="10">ten</num> times more to be dreaded than all the armed hosts of secession.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>The wives and daughters of Government officials and contractors are be spangled with diamonds, while the wives and daughters of our soldiers are freezing or starving in unpitied, in &#x0022;helpless neglect.&#x0022; It is said that defalcations and theft of <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> officials amount to over a <num value="1000">thousand</num> <num value="1000000">million</num> annually! </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>Nothing can save it. You may cry &#x0022;traitor&#x0022; at every man who tells the truth about the matter, but such cries will not check the speed at which the <name>Administration</name> drives on into bankruptcy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Let it drive on, since its deluded supporters will not be satisfied until the crash comes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>And when it comes the war must end &mdash; and disastrously, disgracefully, to those who have conducted it; but happily to the nation, since we can have peace on no lighter terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>As it is certain that there can be no step taken to save or reconstruct the <rs>Union</rs> until there is an end of fighting, the people will welcome any ordeal, how ever severe, that brings about the beneficent result.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>Reckless and shallow men will rave at the mention of the word repudiation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>But their profanity does not mend the matter &mdash; does not close the door of even their stolid intellect against the conviction that it is inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>The sum is a simple <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>The interest on the present debt is <measure n="1400000000dollars" type="currency">$1,400,000,000</measure>, <num value="1400">fourteen hundred</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num> of dollars every <measure n="10years" type="date">ten years</measure>.

Hereafter the surplus wealth of the <rs>North</rs> will fall, for a great many years, far below the above figures, because a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men who have been producers of wealth, have been drawn off into the army, where They have not only ceased to be producers, but have become non producing consumers, and destroyers of wealth already accumulated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>If all the surplus productions of the <name>North</name> and <name>West</name> are hereafter given up to the <rs>Government</rs>, they will pay only a fraction of the bare interest on the war debt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>That is, if all the farmers producers and laborers give up to the <rs>Government</rs> every dollar of their earnings, except what barely supports life, they can only succeed in paying a fraction of the interest on the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> debt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>What must become of the principal where the payment of the interest is beyond the possible reach of the people?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Is there any escape, except through the door by which our continental debt was relied off from the shoulders of the people? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/> Repudiation, therefore, is not a question of right or wrong, but of necessity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>All must agree that repudiation is a very bad thing, but this general condemnation does not remove its inevitability.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Death is an unwelcome visitor to all but all must nevertheless submit to it.
