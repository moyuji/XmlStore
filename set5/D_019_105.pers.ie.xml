<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>The State authorities cannot do everything.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>They have had but <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> to prepare munitions and defences, which may well have employed <num value="4">four</num> times as many months.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>The State herself has been taken in some respects unawares.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>It is not meet that we should be specific on this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>We would say only enough to excuse any temporary delay and disappointment which the gallant young men in the interior may have experienced in their expectations of assistance from <placeName key="tgn,7013964" n="1.000 5" reg="richmond, richmond, virginia">Richmond</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/> Much can be done by the country itself without the help of the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>The young men can form into companies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>They can perfect themselves in the drill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>They can organize thoroughly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>The counties can do much towards supplying them with clothing and provisions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>The citizens can do very much towards supplying them with arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>There are many arms in the country which would do terrible execution upon an invader, but which an inspecting officer would reject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>There is no better arm for execution than the long, heavy rifle of the <rs>Virginia</rs> sharp-shooter.--That was the arm which drove the stealthy savage from the <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName> forests.--That was the arm which won <placeName key="possibilities=15" n="1.000 10" reg=",">King's Mountain</placeName> and turned the tide of battle against the enemy which finally swept him from our shores at <placeName reg="Yorktown, York, Virginia" key="tgn,2115169">Yorktown</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>There is great virtue in that good old rifle of blessed memory.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>It can speak a terrific rebuke to the invaders of a free country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>There is not a county from tide-water to the Big Sandy that could not arm <num value="1">one</num> or <num value="2">two</num> companies of a <num value="100">hundred</num> men with this deadly rifle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>It would be heavy to carry; but the boys would not feel a weight they are so accustomed to bear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>If we can do no better, this is the arm for our impromptu infantry who may fail in procuring muskets from the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>An invaded people must not be too fastidious about the weapons they use against a marauding foe. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/> But these are not the only arms which interior <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> affords.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>The double-barrel shot gun, charged with a complement of buckshot, is the best of all arms for mounted rangers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>On the frontiers of <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName> the <rs>Federal Government</rs> had adopted this arm for operations against the <name>Camanches</name>, in preference to all the excellent improved carbines of modern invention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>Mounted rangers, guerillas, are terribly harassing to an invading force.--The invader will only be formidable by his numbers and his <orgName n="Flying Artillery" type="artillery">flying artillery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>The ubiquitous mounted ranger, hanging around his skirts, wounding his men every hour, but not quite killing them with his buckshot, imposing upon him the burden of taking care of his disabled, never appearing in mass to form a target for his artillery, and yet ever threatening artillery, baggage and army, proves even more effective for his destruction in the long run than formally organized and disciplined troops.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>The moment the invader's foot touches our soil, that moment should the land swarm in every direction around him with riflemen and mounted rangers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/> Our people need not wait for the action of State authorities to prepare for and provide the means of this mode of defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>The State will have a well-disciplined and thoroughly provided army to meet the invaders in front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>These will conduct the formal and scientific measures and plans of defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>These will keep the enemy busy in his front.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>But the worst calamities of invasion are those which are inflicted by marauding bands of the enemy attacking farm houses and intruding themselves into domestic households.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>If his line of march is made to swarm with our guerillas; who will pick off every man and every squad that dares to leave the main body of the invading column, his very success in the field will prove his ruin; for they will tempt him further and further into the interior, and involve him more and more inextricably in the meshes and snares of guerilla warfare. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/> It becomes the people of the interior to look well to this subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>We know not on what day the columns of the enemy may defile into the <rs>State</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>We know not in what quarter or quarters his entrance may be made.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>But every county may in a week or <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> have a force in readiness to send forth to meet him. Whatever companies may not be supplied with regular arms and ordered to join the regular <orgName n="Army of Defense" type="army">army of defence</orgName>, may be ready, notwithstanding, with their own weapons, and upon their own hock, to take the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>They may proceed to the scene of invasion by twos and threes; they may form on the ground and commence, with orders or without, the lawful duty of shooting down the invader in his tracks. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/> A brave soul will compensate anywhere for a percussion lock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>A daring patriotism will at any time make up much distance in the range of a gun. A daring and dashing guerilla cavalry, with buckshot and broad-swords, will terribly disorganize the best batteries of artillery. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/> Our object is to impress upon the good people of interior <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> the importance of self- reliance and self-exertion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>We would implore them to take no discouragement from any delay or disappointment they may encounter in procuring modern arms from the <rs>State</rs> authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>If we have not suggested the best means of substituting these, their own good sense will point out to them better substitutes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>A <num value="100000">hundred thousand</num> men have tendered their services to the <rs>State</rs>; and, in the nature of things, <measure n="3weeks" type="date">three weeks</measure> time has not been sufficient to provide the necessary equipments for so vast a force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>The best thing that can be done is for the people and the counties to aid in providing such arms as the interior country affords.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>We should not measure the force we shall oppose to the invader by the number we can supply with improved arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/>We should make up in numbers of determined men what we lack in quality of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>We must not only meet the invader in front, but we must envelope him on every side by a wall of fire and steel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>This impression we seek to remove.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/><q> &#x0022;Justice&#x0022;</q> says: <cit><q rend="inline">&#x0022;We beg leave to say simply that it was <hi rend="italics">mainly</hi> a question of discipline which was involved in the case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>The State had not seceded when <rs type="role">Dr.</rs> J. ordered the flag not to be put up--(to come down it ought to be.)

<milestone unit="sentence" n="762"/>There is no law against putting up flags on the <rs type="place">College</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="763"/>Both of these facts are proved by their taking the vote.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="764"/><rs type="role">Dr.</rs> J. himself said that he wouldn't object to a <hi rend="italics">Union</hi> flag, when the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> flag was put up.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="766"/>When <rs type="role">Dr.</rs> J. undertakes to talk about insult, he should recollect that he said when he burnt the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> flag, <q>&#x0022;that he hadn't thought that there was a <hi rend="italics">traitor</hi> in College; that the man who put up that flag was a <hi rend="italics">white-livered scoundrel;</hi> that if this had been done in the <rs>College</rs> of the same name in <placeName reg="Pennsylvania" key="tgn,7007710">Pennsylvania</placeName>, the author would have been ridden on a rail.&#x0022;</q> He also said to the <name>Senior</name> class, the majority of whom he knew were for secession, that <q>&#x0022;<hi rend="italics">all</hi> who were for secession were perjured traitors.&#x0022;</q> At a meeting of the <name>Faculty</name>, <rs type="role">Dr.</rs> J. said <q>&#x0022;he'd made up his mind; he would resign if that flag stand up&#x0022;</q> The other members of the <name>Faculty</name> said their minds were made up; they didn't see any impropriety in it; they would vote for its staying up. When the seniors and juniors went to recite, he asked them if the flag was up, they told him that it was. He said <q>&#x0022;I will not hear a recitation or deliver a lecture under a <hi rend="italics">rebel</hi> flag.&#x0022;</q> They dispersed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="767"/>The other members of the <name>Faculty</name> are as anxious to preserve discipline as <rs type="role">Dr.</rs> J., with this difference: <hi rend="italics">they</hi> treat us as gentlemen.
