<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/> <measure n="30years" type="date">Thirty years</measure> ago the newspaper press of New York compared favorably in dignity and ability with that of say city in the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="397"/>It was a last; representative of the New York of that time &mdash; solid, unpretending, moral, and patriotic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="398"/>The class of sensation papers had not then arisen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="399"/>The prolific time of the day were then known only in <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, and were only noticed now and then in a short paragraph in the New York papers as curious exhibitions of human eccentricity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="402"/>At that time, the press had none of those powerful auxiliaries of steam and electricity which now give wings to intelligence, but with the resources and appliances at its command, it met as promptly and faithfully all the requirements of the public upon it as the modern newspaper It was a welcome visitor at every breakfast table and counting room, and it left no sting or stain behind it. Of course, at that period, such a thing as abolitionism was unknown.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="403"/>In the <placeName type="city" key="tgn,7007567">city of New York</placeName> at that day, an abolitionist was as great a curiosity as a rhinoceros.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="405"/>Indeed, in all Christendom there was no more intelligent, respectable and public-spirited city than the New York of <num value="30">thirty</num> or <measure n="40years" type="date">forty years</measure> ago; no city whose professional, business and working classes stood higher in intelligence and efficiency, and none whose press was a worthier and more faithful representative of public elevation and sentiment. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/> The mammoth newspaper of New York today is a wonderful contrast in size and pretension to the modest sheet of former years; but, except.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="413"/>In its purely commercial articles, which owe their superior merit and value only to the superior commercial enterprise and business of the city, there is no single respect in which they do not fall behind the New York press of <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of a century ago. There was more information, more scholarship, more of every qualification necessary to the instruction and guidance of the public, among the editors of that day than the present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>Instead of the nauseating pedantry of the <hi rend="italics">Tribune,</hi> there was the genuine scholarship of such a paper as the New York <hi rend="italics"><rs n="American" type="group">American</rs>,</hi> whose editor was afterwards elected <rs type="role2">President</rs> of that noble institution, <orgName n="Columbian College" type="college">Columbian College</orgName>; instead of the elaborate and dismal facetiousness of <hi rend="smallcaps">Doesticks,</hi> the sparkle of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Noah,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00324" reg="mostcommon:Noah,nomatch:0"><surname>Noah</surname></persName>'s</hi> Delightful humor made his &#x0022;Star&#x0022; <num value="1">one</num> of the most attractive of newspaper luminaries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="416"/>As New York increased in wealth and population, the staid old residents were thrust to the wall by adventurers from every land under Heaven, embracing among them many honest and good people, but a vast number of fanatics, reprobates and villains of every hue and dye. The depraved element of population produced a depraved press, which took root in the moral decomposition which is engendered by too great prosperity, and was fertilized to overshadowing proportions by the increasing social corruptions of the times.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="417"/>Indeed, when we reflect upon the commanding position of New York in the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Confederacy, and think of the effect which a corrupt and debauched journalism in that central point must exert upon the public tastes and morals, we may well question whether the freedom of the press, as far as our own country is concerned, has not proved a curse instead of a blessing. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="648"/>So, when her cousin, <persName n="Wilson,,Frank,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00471" reg="default:Wilson,Frank,,,"><foreName>Frank</foreName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName>, came home from a long absence at sea, and <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> was kind and protective to her; secondly, attentive; and, thirdly, desperately in love with her, she hardly knew how to be grateful enough to him. It is true, she would have preferred his remaining in the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> or <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num> stages of behavior, for his violent love puzzled and frightened her. Her uncle neither helped nor hindered the love affair, though it was going on under his own eyes <persName><foreName>Frank</foreName></persName>'s stepmother had such a variable temper that there was no knowing whether what she liked <num value="1">one</num> day she would like the next, or not. At length she went to such extremes of crossness that <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName> was only too glad to shut her eyes and rush blindly at the chance of escape from domestic tyranny offered her by a marriage with her cousin; and, liking him better than any <num value="1">one</num> in the world except her uncle, (who was at this time at sea,) she went off <num value="1">one</num> morning and was married to him, her only bridesmaid being the housemaid at her aunt's. The consequence was, that <persName><foreName>Frank</foreName></persName> and his wife went into lodgings, and <persName n="Wilson,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00472" reg="nearbymention:Wilson,Frank,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName> refused to see them, and turned away.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="649"/>Norah, the warm-hearted housemaid, whom they accordingly took into their service.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="650"/>When <persName n="Wilson,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00473" reg="nearbymention:Wilson,Frank,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName> returned from his voyage, he was very cordial with the young couple, and spent many an evening at their lodgings, smoking his pipe and sipping his grog; but he told them that, for quietness' sake, he could not ask them to his own house, for his wife was bitter against them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="651"/>They were not, however, very unhappy about this. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="652"/>The seed of future unhappiness lay rather in <persName><foreName>Frank</foreName></persName>'s vehement, passionate disposition, which led him to resent his wife's shyness and want of demonstrativeness as failures in conjugal duty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="653"/>He was already tormenting himself, and her, too, in a slighter degree, by apprehensions and imaginations of what might befall her during his approaching absence at sea. At last he went to his father and urged him to insist upon <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName>'s being once more received under his roof, the more especially as there was now a prospect of her confinement while her husband was away on his voyage.--<persName n="Wilson,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00474" reg="nearbymention:Wilson,Frank,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName> was, as he expressed it, &#x0022;breaking up,&#x0022; and unwilling to undergo the excitement of a scene, yet he felt that what his son said was true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>So he went to his wife; and, before <persName><foreName>Frank</foreName></persName> set sail, he had the comfort of seeing his wife installed in her old little garret in his father's house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>To have placed her in the <num value="1">one</num> best spare room was a step beyond <persName n="Wilson,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00475" reg="nearbymention:Wilson,Frank,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName>'s powers of submission or generosity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>The worst part about it, however, was, that the faithful <rs>Norah</rs> had to be dismissed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>Her place as housemaid had been filled up; and, even if it had not, she had forfeited <persName n="Wilson,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00476" reg="nearbymention:Wilson,Frank,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName>'s good opinion forever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/>She comforted her young master and mistress by pleasant prophecies of the time when they would have a household of their own, of which, whatever service she might be in meanwhile, she should be sure to form a part.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>Almost the last action <persName><foreName>Frank</foreName></persName> did before setting sail was going with <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName> to see Norah once more at her mother's house, and then he went away. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/> <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName>'s father-in-law grew more and more feeble as the winter advanced.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>She was of great use to her stepmother in nursing and amusing him; and, although there was anxiety enough in the household, there was, perhaps, more of peace than there had been for years, for <persName n="Wilson,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00477" reg="nearbymention:Wilson,Frank,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName> had not a bad heart and was softened by the visible approach of death to <num value="1">one</num> whom she loved, and touched by the lonely condition of the young creature, expecting her <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> confinement in her husband's absence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/>To this relenting mood Norah owed the permission to come and nurse <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName> when her baby was born, and to remain to attend on <persName n="Wilson,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00478" reg="nearbymention:Wilson,Frank,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Captain</roleName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/> Before <num value="1">one</num> letter had been received from <persName><foreName>Frank</foreName></persName> (who had called for the <placeName reg="East Indies" key="tgn,6001831">East Indies</placeName> and <placeName reg="Zhonghua" key="tgn,1000111">China</placeName>) his father died.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/><persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName> was always glad to remember that he had held her baby in his arms, and kissed and blessed it before his <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> death.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>After that, and the consequent examination into the state of his affairs, it was found that he had left far less property than people had been led by his style of living to expect, and what money there <sic>was was</sic> all settled upon his wife, and at her disposal after her death.--This did not signify much to <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName>, as <persName><foreName>Frank</foreName></persName> was now <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> mate of his ship, and in another voyage or <num value="2">two</num> would be captain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>Meanwhile he had left her rather more than <measure n="200l." type="pounds"><num value="200">two hundred</num> pounds</measure> (all his savings) in the bank. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/> It became time for <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName> to hear from her husband.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/><num value="1">One</num> letter from the <name>Cape</name> she had already received.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>The next was to announce his arrival in <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="670"/>As week after week passed over, and no intelligence of the ship having got there reached the office of the owners, and the captain's wife was in the same state of ignorant suspense as <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName> herself, her fears grew most oppressive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="671"/>At length the day came when, in reply to her inquiry at the <rs type="place">Shipping Office</rs>, they told her that the owners had given up hope of ever hearing more of the &#x0022;<persName n="Jane,,Betsy,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00479" reg="default:Jane,Betsy,,,"><foreName>Betsy</foreName> <surname>Jane</surname></persName>,&#x0022; and had sent in their claim upon the underwriters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="672"/>Now that he was gone forever, she <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> felt a yearning, longing love for the kind cousin, the dear friend, the sympathizing protector whom she should never see again--<num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> felt a passionate desire to show him his child, whom she had hitherto rather craved to have all to herself &mdash; her own sole possession.--Her grief was, however, noiseless and quiet &mdash; rather to the scandal of <persName n="Wilson,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00480" reg="nearbymention:Wilson,Frank,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName>, who bewailed her stepson as if he and she had always lived together in perfect harmony, and who evidently thought it her duty to burst into fresh tears at every strange face she saw, dwelling on his poor young widow's desolate state, and the helplessness of the fatherless child, with an unction, as if she liked the excitement of the sorrowful story. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="673"/> So passed away the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> days of <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName>'s widowhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>By-and-by things subsided into their natural and tranquil course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>But, as if this young creature was always to be in some heavy trouble, her ewe lamb began to be ailing, pining and sickly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>The child's mysterious illness turned out to be some affection of the spine, likely to affect health, but not to shorten life &mdash; at least, so the doctors said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>But the long, dreary suffering of <num value="1">one</num> whom a mother loves as <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName> loved her only child, is hard to look forward to. Only Norah guessed what <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName> suffered &mdash; no <num value="1">one</num> but <name n="God" type="God">God</name> knew. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/> And so it fell out that when <persName n="Wilson,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00481" reg="nearbymention:Wilson,Frank,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName> the elder came to her <num value="1">one</num> day in violent distress, occasioned by a very material diminution in the value of the property that her husband had left her &mdash; a diminution that made her income barely enough to support herself, much less <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName> &mdash; the latter could hardly understand how anything which did not touch health or life could cause such grief, and she received the intelligence with irritating composure.--But when, that afternoon, the little sick child was brought in, and the grandmother &mdash; who, after all, loved it well &mdash; began a fresh moan over her losses to its unconscious ears, saying how she had planned to consult this or that doctor, and to give it this or that comfort or luxury in after years, but that now all chance of this had passed away, <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName>'s heart was touched, and she drew near to <persName n="Wilson,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00482" reg="nearbymention:Wilson,Frank,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName> with unwonted caresses, and, in a spirit not unlike to that of <persName n="Ruth,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00483" reg="mostcommon:Ruth,nomatch:0"><surname>Ruth</surname></persName>, entreated that, come what would, they might remain together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>After much discussion in succeeding days, it was arranged that <persName n="Wilson,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00484" reg="nearbymention:Wilson,Frank,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName> should take a house in <placeName reg="Manchester, Manchester, England" key="tgn,7010477">Manchester</placeName>, furnishing it partly with what furniture she had, and providing the rest with <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName>'s remaining <measure n="200l." type="pounds"><num value="200">two hundred</num> pounds</measure>. <persName n="Wilson,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00485" reg="nearbymention:Wilson,Frank,,,"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Wilson</surname></persName> was herself a Manchester woman, and naturally longed to return to her native town; some connections of her own, too, at that time required lodgings, for which they were willing to pay pretty handsomely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="680"/><persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName> undertook the active superintendence and superior work of the household; Norah, willing, faithful Norah, offered to cook, scour, do anything, in short, so that she might but remain with them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="681"/>The plan succeeded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>For some years their <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> lodgers remained with them, and all went smoothly, with the <num value="1">one</num> sad exception of the little girl's increasing deformity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>How that mother loved that child, it is not for words to tell. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>Then came a break of misfortune.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>Their lodgers left, and no <num value="1">one</num> succeeded to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/>After some months it became necessary to remove to a smaller house, and <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName>'s tender conscience was torn by the idea that she ought not to be a burden to her mother-in-law, but to go out and seek her own maintenance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>And leave her child!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="688"/>The thought came like a sweeping boom of a funeral bell over her heart. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/> By-and-by <persName n="Openshaw,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00486" reg="mostcommon:Openshaw,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Openshaw</surname></persName> came to lodge with them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/>He had started in life as the errand boy and sweeper-out of a warehouse; had struggled up through all the grades of employment in it, fighting his way through the hard, striving <placeName reg="Manchester, Manchester, England" key="tgn,7010477">Manchester</placeName> life with strong, pushing energy of character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>Every spare moment of time had been sternly given up to self-teaching.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>He was a capital accountant, a good <name>French</name> and <rs n="German" type="group">German</rs> scholar, a keen, far-seeing tradesman &mdash; understanding markets, and the bearing of events, both near and distant, on trade, and yet with such vivid attention to present details, that I do not think he ever saw a group of flowers in the fields without thinking whether their colors would or would not form harmonious contrasts in the coming spring muslins and prints.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/>He went to debating societies, and threw himself with all his heart and soul into politics; esteeming, it must be owned, every man a fool or a knave who differed from him, and overthrowing his opponents rather by the loud strength of his language than the calm strength of his logic.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>There was something of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> in all this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>Indeed, his theory ran parallel to the famous <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> motto-- &#x0022;<placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> flogs creation, and <placeName reg="Manchester, Manchester, England" key="tgn,7010477">Manchester</placeName> flogs <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>.&#x0022; Such a man, as may be fancied, <sic>had had</sic> no time for falling in love, or any such nonsense.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/>At the age when most young men go through their courting and matrimony, he had not the means of keeping a wife, and was far too practical to think of having <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>And now that he was in easy circumstances, a rising man, he considered women almost as encumbrances to the world, with whom a man had better have as little to do as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>His <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> impression of <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName> was indistinct, and he did not care enough about her to make it distinct. &#x0022;A pretty, yea-nay kind of woman&#x0022; would have been his description of her, if he had been pushed into a corner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/>He was rather afraid, in the beginning, that her quiet ways arose from a listlessness and laziness of character, which would have been exceedingly discordant to his active, energetic nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>But when he found out the punctuality with which his wishes were attended to, and her work was done; when he was called in the morning at the very stroke of the clock, his shaving-water scalding hot, his fire bright, his coffee made exactly as his peculiar fancy dictated, (for he was a man who had his theory about everything, based upon what he knew of science, and often perfectly original.) then he began to think, not that <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName> had any peculiar merit, but that he had got into remarkably good lodgings; his restlessness wore away, and he began to consider himself as almost settled for life in them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/> <persName n="Openshaw,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00487" reg="mostcommon:Openshaw,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Openshaw</surname></persName> had been too busy all his days to be introspective.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/>He did not know that he had any tenderness in his nature; and if he had become conscious of its abstract existence, he would have considered it as a manifestation of disease in some part of him. But he was decoyed into pity unawares, and pity led on to tenderness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>That little helpless child &mdash; always carried about by <num value="1">one</num> of the <num value="3">three</num> busy women of the house, or else patiently threading colored beads in the chair from which, by no effort of its own, could it ever move &mdash; the great, grave blue eyes, full of serious, not uncheerful expression, giving to the small, delicate face a look beyond its years &mdash; the soft, plaintive voice, dropping out but few words, so unlike the continual prattle of a child, caught <persName n="Openshaw,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00488" reg="mostcommon:Openshaw,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Openshaw</surname></persName>'s attention in spite of himself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/><num value="1">One</num> day &mdash; he half scorned himself for doing so &mdash; he cut short his dinner hour to go in search of some toy which should take the place of those eternal beads.--I forget what he bought, but when he gave the present (which he took care to do in a short, abrupt manner, and when no <num value="1">one</num> was by to see him) he was almost thrilled by the flash of delight that came over that child's face, and he could not help, all through that afternoon, going over and over again the picture left on his memory by the bright effect of unexpected joy on the little girl's face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/>When he returned home he found his slippers placed by his sitting-room fire, and even more careful attention paid to his fancies than was habitual in those model lodgings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>When <persName><foreName>Alice</foreName></persName> had taken the last of his tea-things away &mdash; she had been silent, as usual, till then &mdash; she stood for an instant with the door in her hand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/><persName n="Openshaw,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00489" reg="mostcommon:Openshaw,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Openshaw</surname></persName> looked as if he were deep in his book, though in fact he did not see a line, but was heartily wishing the woman would go, and not make any palaver of gratitude.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>But she only said: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/> &#x0022;I am very much obliged to you, sir. Thank you very much,&#x0022; and was gone, even before he could send her away with a &#x0022;There, my good woman, that's enough!&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit>
