<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="362"/> As far as we can learn, the wounded and prisoners have been treated on both sides as well as the means and situation of the armies permitted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="370"/>The contrast of their condition with that of she escort which conducted them out of the city exhibited conclusive evidence of this good treatment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="371"/>We believe that the same remark is true of the other Federal prisoners who have been held in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="408"/>Some of the statements of the press given assume a very positive shape relative to the intention of those Governments to interfere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="409"/>Yet the <rs>British Ministers</rs>, in their replies in Parliament on the <dateStruct value="--13"><day reg="13">13th inst.</day></dateStruct>, to inquiries propounded, stated that there was no purpose on the part of the <name>Governments</name> to offer mediation in <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> affairs <hi rend="italics">at the present time;</hi> and it was further stated, that the <rs>Government</rs> of <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 13" reg="france">France</placeName> had made no communication to <name n="her Majesty" type="role">Her Majesty's</name> Government on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="410"/>Nevertheless, the very phraseology of the <rs>British Premier</rs>, and the <rs>Minister</rs> for Foreign Affairs, shows that they meditate mediation at some future day. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="411"/> The temper and character of the editorials of leading journals in <placeName reg="Department de Ville de Paris, Ile-de-France, France" key="tgn,7002980">Paris</placeName> and <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName>, as well as the speeches of leading men, justify the conclusion that mediation in some form will be proposed at the earliest moment the <num value="2">two</num> Governments deem it proper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="412"/>A great victory over the huge army sent to take this city may offer such an opportunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="414"/>It is a matter in which interest and feeling go heartily together.
