<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>the manifold deficiencies which the original act contained, the amendments afterwards made in it, at the special instance of the <rs>President</rs>, and its <hi rend="italics">general inefficiency,</hi> arising from its intrinsic defects, proceeded to say that the act was notoriously passed under an alleged <hi rend="italics">necessity</hi> existing at the period of its adoption, and observed that many honorable members then in his eye had confessed that they voted for the law with the most painful reluctance, seriously doubting its constitutionality, and, in fact, only supporting it on the ground of <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="spa">salus republica suprema lax.</foreign></hi> He then reminded the <rs type="place">House</rs> that both the <rs>President</rs> and <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> acknowledged that there was no <hi rend="italics">present necessity</hi> for an extension of the <name>Conscript</name> law.

<list type="ordered"> 
<item n="1"> <num value="1">1</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>The present Conscript law is <hi rend="italics">unconstitutional;</hi> and, if the plan delineated in it should be allowed to glow into a <hi rend="italics">system,</hi> would be altogether subversive of State sovereignty and popular freedom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/></item> 
<item n="2"> <num value="2">2</num>. The <hi rend="italics">necessity</hi> which was alleged to exist formerly for the present law no longer existed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>So the <rs>President</rs> admitted; and such was apparently the truth of the matter, as the former necessity related alone to the <hi rend="italics"><measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> men</hi> then in the field, upon whom the present law had already fully operated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/></item> 
<item n="3"> <num value="3">3</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>He insisted that <num value="250000">two hundred and fifty thousand</num> men could be raised by requisition upon the <name>States</name> in less time than in any other mode.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>On this point he dwelt at some length.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/></item> 
<item n="5"> <num value="5">5</num>. He urged that an army raised in this way would awaken no distrust or alarm in the popular mind, nor occasion any collision with State authorities, <hi rend="italics">always to be deprecated.</hi> </item> 
<item n="6"> <num value="6">6</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>He showed that if such a bill as the <rs>Secretary</rs> recommended should be adopted, collision with <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName>, <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>, and other States, would be inevitable, inasmuch as the new Conscript law would sweep into its vortex the whole body of the militia now organized by them, or in course of organized on. </item> 
<item n="7"> <num value="7">7</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>He insisted that the <rs>Constitution</rs> clearly contemplated leaving the great body of the militia force of the <name>States</name> under <hi rend="italics">State control,</hi> except when called for by the <rs>President</rs> to meet <hi rend="italics">exigencies</hi> specified in that instrument, after the passing away of which they were expected to return once more to their original position, all the while maintaining their <hi rend="italics">political identify</hi> with the <name>States</name> to which they might respectively appertain.
