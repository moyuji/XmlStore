<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/> That portion of this speech which refers to <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> affairs, and was published by us on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, forms <num value="1">one</num> of the most important documents that has yet been presented in the great cause of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Doodle versus the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>The speaker is a member of the <rs>British Cabinet</rs>, and a very influential <num value="1">one</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>Had it not been perfectly agreeable to his colleagues, we hold it to be certain that he never would have made it, and we are therefore induced to regard it in the same light that we regard <num value="1">one</num> of <placeName reg="Napoleon, Henry, Ohio" key="tgn,2080924">Napoleon</placeName>'s <hi rend="italics">brochures,</hi> to feel the pulse of the nation before he takes a step of peculiar importance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/> <persName n="Gladstone,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00207" reg="mostcommon:Gladstone,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gladstone</surname></persName> tells us that he has never thought it for the interest of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> that the <orgName n="American Union" type="newspaper">American Union</orgName> should be destroyed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>At the same time he does not think it for the interest of the slave that it should be restored.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>While the <rs>Union</rs> exists, the <rs>Constitution</rs> requires that Union to enforce the laws made by slave owners with respect to slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>Nevertheless, he cannot see any interest which <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> can have in the disruption of the <rs>Union</rs>, and he feels sure that the natural policy of the <name>Ministry</name> will be approved of by the nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>That the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> Government and people have been exasperated by it is, he thinks, natural enough, as he thinks it quite as natural that they should say hard things of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> about it. But the fact is, that the neutral policy has borne much harder on the <rs>Confederates</rs> than it has on the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>Both parties had a right to buy and carry away as many arms as they wished; but the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> enjoy the freedom of the seas, while the <rs>Confederate</rs> ports are all blockaded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>Still, great allowances are to be made for the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>They are now drinking the bitter cup which was formerly administered to <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>Their empire is about to be dismembered, and it cannot be expected that they should anticipate it with any very pleasant feelings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/><rs n="Englishman" type="group">Englishmen</rs> should there fore bear with any little ebullition of spleen in consideration of kinship and the <sic>kindnesss</sic> with which the <rs>Prince</rs> of <placeName reg="Wales, United Kingdom, Europe" key="tgn,7002443">Wales</placeName> was treated &mdash; It is the more necessary to do this, because it is very plain what is about to happen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>Whatever may be <name>English</name> opinion with regard to slavery, and whether they be for the <rs>South</rs> or against the <rs>South</rs>, <num value="1">one</num> thing at least is very certain, and that is, that <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00208" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName>Jefferson</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> and the other Southern leaders have made an army are making a navy, and <q>&#x0022;have made what is more than either of these --they have made a nation,&#x0022;</q> The success of the <rs>South</rs> in separating from the <rs>North</rs>, may be regarded as certain--<persName n="Gladstone,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00209" reg="mostcommon:Gladstone,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Gladstone</surname></persName> thinks it as certain <q>&#x0022;as any event yet future and contingent can be.&#x0022;</q> From that very certainty, and from the mortification which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs>; must suffer on account of it, he hopes <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> will do nothing to inflict additional shame and mortification upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/><q>&#x0022;It may be that a time may arrive that it will be a duty to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> to offer a word of expostulation, or of friendly aid towards ending the quarrel.&#x0022;</q> When that time shall arrive, it will be important that nothing should have been said to irritate and embitter the <rs>Northern</rs> mind, especially by <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, &#x0026;c. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/> From this speech, we should certainly think the inference fair that <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>, backed by <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, considers it at least possible that she may be called on to inter pose in some shape.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>What that shape may be, or at what time the interposition may take place, does not of course appear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>But it is now plain that the <rs>British Cabinet</rs> sees &mdash; as all the rest of the world sees &mdash; as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> themselves see &mdash; that the attempt to subjugate the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> is utterly hopeless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>It is plain, likewise, that they <unclear></unclear> at the very idea that this tremendous struggle <unclear></unclear> most tremendous of modern times &mdash; is the resent of a mere insurrection on our side, and an attempt to put it down on the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>They see it in <unclear></unclear> as aspect, of a gigantic was between <num value="2">two</num> power States--the <num value="1">one</num> fighting for conquest the other <num value="1">one</num> existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>Perceiving that conquest in utterly <unclear></unclear>impossible, and that the war is now waged for <unclear></unclear> on the <num value="1">one</num> part, and defence on the other nothing is more natural than that neutral nations should step in, part the combatants, and restores the peace of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>All this we say, in natural, and we should repaid it as inevitable, had not the policy of <placeName reg="United Kingdom" key="tgn,7002445">Great Britain</placeName> heretofore been so singular, so opposed to her own interest, and so beyond all rational calculation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>Even now, we are far from giving entire scope to the hope which may yet prove delusive, as it has so often done before. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/> That the correspondent of the <orgName n="New York Express" type="newspaper">New York <hi rend="italics">Express</hi></orgName> whose letter, published by as on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>, produced such a sensation lest week, had heard of this speech when he wrote his letter is evident to us Coupled with the recall of <persName><roleName n="Lord">Lord</roleName> <foreName>Lyons</foreName></persName> to <placeName reg="London, Greater London, England" key="tgn,7011781">London</placeName> and with the semi officer rumors to which the correspondent alluded, It certainly makes out a very striking case.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>It is certain that if the <rs>English</rs> people do not very generally believe that interposition is near at hand, they at least see very clearly that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> will conquer their independence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>As a proof of it, it is only necessary to observe the general tone of their newspapers, all of which, with the exception of a few rabid abolition sheets, such as the <hi rend="italics">News,</hi> regard the issue as certain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>In further confirmation we may and that <name>English</name> capitalists already begin to look to Confederate bonds for investment, and that a single great <name>English</name> house last week invested more than <num value="1000000">one million</num> of dollars in them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>Indeed, we feel compelled to admit that the chances of interposition in some shape appear to us granter now than they ever have been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>But let us not, therefore neglect our preparations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>It will but incite the enemy to greater exercises.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/>He will make <num value="1">one</num> gigantic effort to overwhelm us, and that effort must be met and repelled.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>He will accept of no basis of negotiation short of our absolute submission.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>We must admit the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> to be our masters, and ourselves to be their vassals, who have rebelled against them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>Rebel against the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> I can there be any degradation equal to such an admission! </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>Nor will it be put an end to by this or any other species of savagery which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> may adopt.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>On the contrary it will receive a fresh impetus from such abominable cruelty, even though it lead to the depopulation of <placeName reg="Memphis, Shelby, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017750">Memphis</placeName> and every other Southern town which is polluted by <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> despotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/>And when these towns are depopulated, what will the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> do for new victims of vengeance?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>But before matters have arrived at such a pass it is to be hoped that our Government will adopt some measures of retaliation which will compel our barbarous foe to adhere to the usages of civilized warfare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>The forbearance hitherto exercised towards an enemy committing all manner of atrocities has only emboldened and stimulated him in his career of crime.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>That forbearance is only ascribed to fear, and is crying inhumanity to our own people.
