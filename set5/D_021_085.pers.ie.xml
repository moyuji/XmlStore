<head>The Abolition of slavery in the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName>.</head>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> Some of the radical portion of Congress begin to manifest a little uneasiness at the inordinate haste with which the project of abolishing slavery in the <orgName n="Columbia District" type="district">District of Columbia</orgName> has been pressed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>It is evident that it will not produce the emancipation of a single negro, except such worthless ones as the owners would be glad to get rid of; but the simple agitation of the subject has already had a very deleterious influence upon the free negro population, and instigated an insupportable insolence among them, which forces itself upon the attention of many who were at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> carried away with the idea of abolishing slavery in the <rs>Federal</rs> capital.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>It is rapidly becoming apparent that the prosecution of this schemes will not only make the city of <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> the rendezvous of the most worthless class of population, but will be regarded by the whole country as an evidence of consciousness on the part of the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republicans</rs> that the power they now possess will be soon swept from their grasp, never more to be resumed. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>The earnest and eloquent manner in which he enunciated the duty of Congress, to legislate solely with a view to put down the rebellion, without stooping for a moment to discuss matters of inferior importance, made a deep impression.

On the contrary, through the admirable organization of the local charities, and the liberal support which they had received, every case of real distress and destitution had been investigated and relieved.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="674"/>For a long time past the cotton porters have been reduced to great straits by the greatly diminished imports of cotton, but this evil was income measure counteracted by a large influx of grain-laden vessels, which afforded more than the usual amount of employment in that line.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="675"/>Within the last few weeks, however, the prevalence of easterly winds and other causes had occasioned a great falling off in the number of ships arriving, which had the effect of throwing many hands idle, and to a large extent augmenting the amount of destitution in the town.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="676"/>To meet this, soup kitchens were opened in different parts of the town, by means of which a large amount of relief was afforded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="677"/>A change of wind and a general improvement of the weather has had the effect of bringing in ships, and of affording employment to those who are willing to work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="678"/>This improved state of matters was proved by a marked diminution in the number of applications for relief tickets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="679"/>The highest number of applications on any <num value="1">one</num> day was reached on the <num value="7" type="ordinal">7th</num> inst, since which they have gradually diminished, and do not now exceed <num value="0.5">one-half</num> the number which they did on the occasion referred to. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="682"/>He said that to be selected to preside on such an occasion he felt to be a distinguished honor, for he did not think that a more important meeting had been held in this city since the war has been upon us.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="683"/>Independent of the joy and peace it carries to the soldier, sick, in a desolate hospital, or in active service on the field, independent of all it may do to ameliorate the soldier's spiritual constitution, and to prepare him for a heavenly inheritance, its influence on the success of our arms is worth a <num value="1000">thousand</num> times more than it costs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/>Every tract, every Testament, every prayer-meeting, and every word of religious instruction which by this means is carried to the soldier, will aid in making us a free and happy people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="685"/>The Governor wished all to bear in mind that as soon as peace comes this Government, in all its departments, will go into the hands of those who now fight our battles.
