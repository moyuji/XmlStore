<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> No change has taken place in the situation of affairs since the date of my last letter, except in the extent and character of the enemy's works in and around <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>, and of our own. The town is completely invested on the <rs>South</rs> side of the <placeName key="tgn,2715022" n="1.000 335" reg="tennessee river, united states, north and central america">Tennessee river</placeName> by <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName>'s forces.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>We hold <placeName reg="Missionary Ridge, Hickman, Tennessee" key="tgn,2518191">Missionary Ridge</placeName> in front of the place, <placeName reg="Lookout Mountain, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,2100143">Lookout Mountain</placeName> and the <orgName n="Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad" type="railroad">Nashville and Chattanooga railroad</orgName> on the <rs>South</rs> side, and the valley between Lookout and the <rs type="place">Ridge</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>We also command the <orgName n="Eastern Tennessee Railroad" type="railroad">East Tennessee railroad</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Indeed, our lines rest upon the river above and below the town, just as do those of <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> The enemy continue to work day and night like beavers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>They are building bomb-proofs for their artillerists and their supports, and providing every other means of defence <num value="1">one</num> can imagine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Their efforts are not limited to the <rs>South</rs> side of the river, but extend also to the <rs>North</rs> side, where they have planted batteries on the heights overlooking the river and the town, and in some cases constructed traverses to protect their gunners from the cross fire of our artillery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>If we should get possession of the place, therefore, we should still be exposed to the fire of the batteries beyond the river. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> The outer front line of the enemy is crescent-shaped, the <num value="2">two</num> horns of the crescent resting on the curves of the river above and below the town, and is the complement to the semi-circle described by the river in their rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>Their whole line, therefore, including the river and breastworks, assumes the form of a circle, or rather of an ellipse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The Confederate line conforms to their exterior line, and consequently is a crescent in form.--These facts are as well known to <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> as to <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName>; for the high hill in rear of the town gives the former a full view of our position, and therefore there can be no impropriety in stating them here. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>It was some <placeName><distance reg="4miles">four miles</distance> below the <placeName reg="Tennessee, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName></placeName> line, and on the west side of and near to the <rs>Chickamauga</rs>, which is spelt indifferently with or without a &#x0022;k.&#x0022; Our line ran north<name>east</name> and <name>south</name>west at the commencement of the struggle on <dateStruct><day type="name">Saturday</day></dateStruct>; but, as our left swung round, pushing the enemy before it, its direction became <name>east</name> and <name>west</name>, extending across the valley from the <rs>Chickamauga</rs> to the foot of <placeName reg="Missionary Ridge, Hickman, Tennessee" key="tgn,2518191">Missionary Ridge</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>The enemy retreated down the valley, crossing the ridge through the pass at <placeName key="tgn,2024122" n="1.000 61" reg="rossville, walker, georgia">Rossville</placeName>, the former home of <persName n="Ross,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="default:Ross,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Ross</surname></persName>, the <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> Chief, and thence to <placeName reg="Chattanooga, Hamilton, Tennessee" key="tgn,7017496">Chattanooga</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> It is now believed that our casualties reached <num value="12000">12,000</num>, an unusual proportion of which will fall under the head of comparatively slight wounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>We lost but few prisoners, including <num value="4">four</num> surgeons, who were sent back this morning, together with <measure n="13" type="wounded">thirteen wounded</measure> men. The work of paroling and returning the enemy's wounded who fell into our hands still continues.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>We <measure n="53" type="captured">captured fifty-three</measure> surgeons and some <num value="25">twenty-five</num> or <num value="30">thirty</num> chaplains, who, I understand, will not be returned until the enemy shall release such of our surgeons as are now confined in the prisons of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> We have rumors from <placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825"><rs type="direction">East</rs> Tennessee</placeName>, but otherwise there is no change in the situation of affairs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/><num value="1">One</num> report has it that <persName n="Jones,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00033" reg="mostcommon:Jones,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Jones</surname></persName> has occupied <placeName reg="Knoxville, Knox, Tennessee" key="tgn,7013841">Knoxville</placeName>, and another has it that <persName n="Forrest,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00034" reg="mostcommon:Forrest,nomatch:0"><surname>Forrest</surname></persName> has met <persName n="Burnside,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00035" reg="mostcommon:Burnside,nomatch:0"><surname>Burnside</surname></persName> and defeated him &mdash; both of which, I fear, are premature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/><persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00036" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> made a slight advance on our right yesterday, during a heavy rain that lasted for <measure n="30hours" type="date">thirty hours</measure>, but retired again.--The work of paroling and returning his wounded has not been completed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>About <num value="2300">2,300</num> of his wounded fell into our hands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>These are now being sent within his lines at his request.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>His dead have been wholly uncared for, so far as he is concerned.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>He has never made any request for permission to bury them, as has been alleged in some of the public prints.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>The last correspondence between him and <persName n="Bragg,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00037" reg="nearbymention:Bragg,Gen,,,"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Bragg</surname></persName> previous to the battle terminated in anger on the part of <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00038" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName>, who informed <persName n="Gen,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00039" reg="mostcommon:Gen,nomatch:0"><surname>Gen</surname></persName>. B. that for the future he would hold no further communication with him except under a battle flag.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>This resolution seems to have undergone a change, for his request that his wounded might be paroled and returned to him was couched in terms of unusual courtesy and respect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>It is wonderful what effect a good drubbing has upon the manners of some people. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/> The late battle has thrown a large number of wounded men upon the <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">State of Georgia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>Heretofore the people of that State have seen but little of the war &mdash; its horrors, its sufferings, its ghastly wounds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>A great battle has been fought upon their soil, and an opportunity is now afforded them, and especially her women, to emulate the example set them by the <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginians</rs> in their tender care of, and generous hospitality to, the wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>I am glad to hear the people are responding to the demands now made upon their sympathy and humanity in a manner that at once evinces their zeal and generous sentiments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Every wound received upon the banks of the <placeName reg="Chickamauga river">Chickamauga</placeName> was a wound received in their defence, and every man and woman within the limits of the <rs>State</rs> should feel it to be their duty, as well as a privilege, to do what they can to assuage those wounds and comfort and sustain their noble defenders. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/> The resolute manner in which the people of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName> breasted the storm which lately broke upon her northern border, while it furnishes an example to other States, should be a cause of pride to all her children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>She was called upon for <num value="8000">8,000</num> men, in addition to the <num value="80000">80,000</num> she had already sent to the field, and she promptly furnished <num value="15000">15,000</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>Old men and boys, sound men and cripples, exempts, ministers of the <name>Gospel</name>, members of the <name>Legislature</name> and Congress, <rs type="role" reg="President">Presidents</rs> of colleges, ex-Judges and ex-Senators, retired officers of the army, and even young girls, abandoned their homes and rushed to arms, resolved that the invader should never gain a foothold upon the soil of their great State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/><num value="1">One</num> feels encouraged by such resolution and such hearty patriotism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>Had <persName n="Rosecrans,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00040" reg="mostcommon:Rosecrans,nomatch:0"><surname>Rosecrans</surname></persName> won the <rs n="Battle of Chickamauga" type="battle">battle of Chickamauga</rs> and penetrated further into the <rs>State</rs>, it would only have been to encounter a fresh foe in every defile and behind every bush along his line of march.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>This large levy is still under arms, ready and eager to respond to any call that may be made upon them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/> The comfort of an army that is capable of such achievements and such sacrifices should be the constant care of the <rs>Government</rs> and the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>The troops should be furnished not only with ample supplies of good food and clothing, but with such other comforts as the circumstances of the country will permit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>But, unfortunately, they do not always receive the rations of food to which they are entitled; and not unfrequently the bacon that is distributed to them is unfit for use, having been improperly cured, or put up in localities where the climate was too warm.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>This subject is not referred to here for the purpose of finding <persName><foreName>Sault</foreName></persName> with the <orgName n="Subsistence department" type="department">Subsistence Department</orgName>--for the writer is well aware of the difficulties which surround that branch <milestone unit="column" n="4"/> of the public service &mdash; but of making a suggestion; which is, that all the tobacco received by the <rs>Government</rs> under the tax in kind be distributed to the troops in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>An arrangement of this, kind would be a partial, though not full, compensation for the diminished rations of meat and flour which they frequently receive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>There are men in this army who have, since the <rs n="Battle of Chickamauga" type="battle">battle of Chickamauga</rs>, paid as much as <measure n="1dollars" type="currency">one dollar</measure> for a chew of tobacco!
