<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>The position which he has taken, and which it is to be presumed he has fortified to its greatest capacity for resistance, renders <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00145" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:1"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>'s situation critical in the extreme.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/>He has with him at <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>, according to information derived from sources believed to be perfectly reliable, not more than <num value="45000">forty-five thousand</num> effective men, all told, at this time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>He crossed the river with <num value="62500">sixty-two thousand five hundred</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>He has not been largely reinforced since.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/>He has lost in battles, skirmishes, and from sickness, desertion, straggling, and other causes, quite enough men to answer for the difference between <num value="62000">sixty-two thousand</num> and <num value="45000">forty-five thousand</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>The ridiculous stories circulated about the strength of his army while it was on the march to the <rs>Chattahoochee</rs>--<num value="1">one</num> of which placed it at <num value="120000">one hundred and twenty thousand</num> man &mdash; are now understood to have been mere inventions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/>The <orgName>army of <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00146" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName></orgName> is supposed to be not greatly inferior to that of its adversary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>It has recovered its spirits and discipline in a remarkable degree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/>It is in position in the enemy's rear, upon his only line of communication; it is strongly fortified, and is calmly awaiting for the enemy to advance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>Shereman has, no doubt, collected many stores in <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/>But it is impossible that he can have collected more than enough to last him a very few weeks, seeing that he has but <num value="1">one</num> railroad to bring them over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>He must either advance to <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName> or <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>, or he must fall back and sweep <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00147" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> out of his way. Either operation is difficult. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/> An advance in the direction of either <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName> or <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName> would be the signal for all the country over which he has passed to rise in his rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>The <orgName>army of <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00148" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName></orgName>, in that case, would serve as a nucleus around which the whole strength of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248"><rs type="direction">Northern</rs> Georgia</placeName> would rally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/>Followed closely in the rear by <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00149" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName>, he would be assailed in flank and front by every man or boy who could carry a gun or mount a horse.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>Arrived before <placeName reg="Augusta, Richmond, Georgia" key="tgn,7017498">Augusta</placeName> or <placeName reg="Mobile, Mobile, Alabama" key="tgn,7017444">Mobile</placeName>, he would find a force in his front prepared to resist him, and he would find <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00150" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> and his other friends still in his rear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>To fall back; on the other hand, in the direction of his supplies, would be equally hazardous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>He would, in that case, be compelled to fight <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00151" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> entrenched up to his chin, or to get around him by flanking.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>In the meantime, <persName n="Forrest,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00152" reg="mostcommon:Forrest,nomatch:0"><surname>Forrest</surname></persName> is between <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00153" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> and <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName> breaking up the railroads and destroying the communications of every kind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>Should he pass <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00154" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> by flanking, he will still find it difficult to subsist his army in a country rendered so desolate as that of <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248"><rs type="direction">North</rs> Georgia</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>His only hope, it seems to us, would lie in reinforcements to come through <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName> from beyond the <rs>Ohio</rs>, and they would have to run the gauntlet of <persName n="Forrest,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00155" reg="mostcommon:Forrest,nomatch:0"><surname>Forrest</surname></persName> and the guerrillas.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>In fine, we can hardly conceive a case in which <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00156" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:1"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> will not be reduced to extreme difficulty, if the proper vigilance be used, and the proper men hold the command. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/> We, in common with others, have fallen into error in regard to the late truce between <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00157" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">Generals</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName> and <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00158" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:1"><roleName n="General"></roleName><surname>Sherman</surname></persName>, which it is important to the truth of history we should correct.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>The idea obtains that the truce was general as to place, and that it was proposed by <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00159" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:1"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> in order to overreach <persName n="Hood,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00160" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><surname>Hood</surname></persName> and gain some advantage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>This is a mistaken view of the subject, as will be seen by reference to the terms of the truce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>The suspension of hostilities between the <num value="2">two</num> armies was limited to Rough and Ready and its immediate neighborhood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>It did not include <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> nor <placeName reg="Jonesboro, Clayton, Georgia" key="tgn,2023284">Jonesboro</placeName>', nor any other point but the above-named station on the <orgName n="Macon Railroad" type="railroad">Macon railway</orgName>, and a limited space around it. This station had been agreed upon as the place for the delivery of the exiles from <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> and the exchange of prisoners, just as <placeName reg="Fuquay-Varina, Wake, North Carolina" key="tgn,2074737">Varina</placeName> below <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> was selected as the point of exchange in this part of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>It was perfectly permissible to <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00161" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName>, at any time during the truce, to attack <persName n="Sherman,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00162" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,W.,T.,,:1"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Sherman</surname></persName> in <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName>, or for the latter to move upon him at <placeName reg="Jonesboro, Clayton, Georgia" key="tgn,2023284">Jonesboro</placeName>', if either had been so inclined, or in a condition to undertake offensive operations. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>The truth is, <persName n="Hood,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00164" reg="mostcommon:Hood,nomatch:0"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Hood</surname></persName> was in no condition to renew hostilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>An army that was not able to hold <placeName reg="Atlanta, Fulton, Georgia" key="tgn,7013331">Atlanta</placeName> when stationed behind entrenchments was not to be expected to retake it by assault after the enemy had got possession of those entrenchments. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/> The vigilance of the <rs>Government</rs> in the present period of the war is highly gratifying.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>The enemy is putting forth all his strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>He has, in his own conceit,--to which there is no limit &mdash; imagined that this is the time for &#x0022;crushing the rebellion.&#x0022; He thinks it is only necessary, just now, to increase the number &mdash; the brute force &mdash; of his invading armies in order to overwhelm all further <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> resistance from the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>He is straining every nerve to do this:--all the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, all the foreigners, all the <hi rend="italics">negroes,</hi> that he can bring into the field, he is marshalling, with an utter indifference to human life, under the butchers which command them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>To meet this increased exertion, these swelling numbers of the invader, our own Government has called upon the people to rally to the assistance and reinforcement of our brave armies, which have for so many months held him at bay. They are responding to the call, and the country will be triumphantly defended. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/> Is not this encouraging to us all?--Should not every true-hearted man, as he marches to the field, derive cheerfulness and confidence from the very measures which call him there?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>He sees that the <rs>Government</rs> is in earnest, and determined to save the country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>He sees that such exertions, on our part, are necessary, because the enemy is making greater efforts for our subjugation than at any time since the war began.--Therefore, instead of being dispirited because our Government is putting forth its own strength with more vigor than ever, he is cheered and gladdened.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>To remain passive, to make not a single effort more than has been made, while the enemy is concentrating all his vast resources, with unparalleled energy and malignity, against us, would be suicidal and imbecile, if not treacherous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>To meet the occasion like men is the only way for the <rs>Government</rs> to acquit itself with good faith to the country &mdash; to rally to the public defence with alacrity and courage &mdash; the only manner in which the citizen can discharge the solemn duty to his country which is next in dignity to his duty to <name n="God" type="God">God</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>Then these proceedings &mdash; these movements of the <rs>Government</rs> and the <name>People</name> &mdash; shed a halo of brightness over the land.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>They give sign of the coming event, like those which have followed every exigency of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> since the war; a triumph by the exertion of the national strength proportionate to the emergency.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/> The plan of this new organization is designed to be an economical <num value="1">one</num>; and as its members are to be the <hi rend="smallcaps">News Reporters,</hi> its reports are expected to be not only reliable, but unencumbered with useless verbiage and unimportant intelligence. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/> In cities, where <num value="2">two</num> or more papers are published, the editors can readily appoint <num value="1">one</num> of their number to receive and forward news &mdash; and thus the entire Association can work harmoniously and economically, and at the same time relieve the telegraph wires (which are often heavily pressed with Government work) of a vast quantity of superfluous labor. </p>
