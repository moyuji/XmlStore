<head>The production of saltpetre &mdash; something for every man to do.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> We beg leave to call the attention of our citizens to an important subject connected with the maintenance of our cause, and upon which absolutely depends our capability of self-defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The blockade of the <rs>Lincoln Government</rs>, although incomplete, and in many respects merely nominal, interposes obstruction to commerce sufficent to prevent our reliance upon foreign nations for articles of prime necessity in the conduct of the war.--In fact, <num value="1">one</num> of the compensatory advantages incident to the present exigency of our affairs, is the self-dependence which is imposes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>Our people so long accustomed to procure by exchange for their own productions, whatever they might require, had become almost entirely helpless.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Suddenly thrown upon their own resources, they seemed bewildered at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, but soon this paralysis passed away.--Their energy and enterprise sought channels for exercise, the multiplied wants of the crisis were supplied, and now we are fast approaching a condition of independence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/> The <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> has exhibited from the beginning an anxious desire to encourage and stimulate the efforts of the people in this direction, and for this purpose has offered rewards to industry greater than would be given under different circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>It has been especially liberal in the encouragement afforded to all enterprises set on foot for supplying munitions of war. We have among us all the elements necessary to furnish these in abundance if a sufficient amount of labor with comparatively small capital is turned in the proper direction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>Thus, while affording profitable employment to large numbers of our citizens who would otherwise remain idle during a period of general business stagnation, the <rs>Government</rs> assists in developing the resources of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and teaches the important lesson of self-reliance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> It is well known that we have within ourselves all the materials necessary for the manufacture of powder, which is the very life blood of war, but some preliminary preparation is required before they can be converted into the proper form for use. Saltpetre, which constitutes <num value="3">three</num>-<num value=".25">fourths</num> parts of the whole, is not found in sufficient quantities, already made, to meet the demands of the present enormous consumption, and our powder mills, therefore, are not employed to the full extent of their capacity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>The sources from which it can be obtained, however, are inexhaustible, and only a little labor and capital are required to procure it in the amplest abundance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> The <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName>, some time since, offered <hi rend="italics"><num value="35">thirty-five</num></hi> cents per pound for all saltpetre <hi rend="italics">delivered</hi> before the <date value="1862-01-01">1st of January, 1862,</date> but in order to induce its manufacture by our own people at home, has proposed to give <measure n="50cents" type="currency">fifty cents</measure> per pound for all that is made within the <rs>Confederacy</rs> until <date value="1863-01">January, 1863</date> and for all made from artificial beds <measure n="50cents" type="currency">50 cents</measure> per pound until <date value="1864-01">January, 1864.</date> When it is remembered that saltpetre is sold in Bengal at-<measure n="3cents" type="currency">three cents</measure> per pound, and actually taken in payment of taxes by <placeName reg="Prussia" key="tgn,7016786">Prussia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Sverige" key="tgn,1000097">Sweden</placeName> at <measure n="6cents" type="currency">six cents</measure> per pound, and that we have equal facilities with them for its manufacture, the liberality of the <rs>Government</rs> and the lucrativeness of the business will be apparent. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> We subjoin below <num value="2">two</num> communications, which deserve general and earnest attention, both from the importance of the subject and the high character of their authors. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/> The supply of nitre for the fabrication of gunpowder being limited to the nitrous earths found in the vaves of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>, of which the supply is uncertain, and, from a partial examination recently made, of a quantity not sufficient for the amount that will be required for a long war, I beg leave, very respectfully, to call the attention of your <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs> to the fact, and to suggest to you the propriety of establishing artificial nitre beds in every county in <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> During the war which followed the <rs>French</rs> revolution, the supply of foreign nitre was cut off from the <name>Continent</name> by the <rs>English</rs> blockade; but, instead of depriving the <rs>French</rs> of this article of prime necessity for carrying on the war, means were at once adopted for making it in quantity and quality sufficient to meet the gigantic demands for an army of a <num value="1000000">million</num> of men. This was done by artificial nitre beds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>In <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName> alone the yield was a <num value="1000">thousand</num> tons per annum.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>It was proportionate in <placeName reg="Nederland" key="tgn,7016845">Holland</placeName>, <placeName reg="Prussia" key="tgn,7016786">Prussia</placeName>, <persName n="Sweeden,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00008" reg="mostcommon:Sweeden,nomatch:0"><surname>Sweeden</surname></persName>, and <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>The practice of extracting nitre from beds is still kept up in <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName>, especially in <placeName key="tgn,7016786" n="1.000 5" reg="prussia">Prussia</placeName> and <persName n="Sweeden,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Sweeden,nomatch:0"><surname>Sweeden</surname></persName>, where it (nitre) is received in the payment of taxes at a stipulated price. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> It is true that <num value="1">one</num> or more cargoes of nitre may pass the inefficient <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> blockade, but as the supply thus obtained is uncertain, while that of &#x0022;beds&#x0022; is certain, I submit to your <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs> if there would not be more wisdom in making nitre ourselves, than in relying upon an uncertain outside supply! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> If you deem my suggestions worthy of consideration, I will be pleased to furnish you with all the information on the subject that you may desire, that I can impart. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> --In reply to your letter of the <date value="28">28th</date> instant, I submit the following statements. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> <num value="1">1</num>. <hi rend="italics">As to the best method of preparing nitre beds.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/> The processes for the formation of nitre, </p> <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> artificially, are based upon the peculiar reactions of decomposing azotized matter in the presence of strong alkaline and earthy bases.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Under these circumstances, the formation of nitric acid goes on regularly and uninterruptedly, under the influence of the atmospheric air. The chemical conditions of the formation of nitre, then, are <num value="3">three</num> decomposing moist azotized substances, alkaline and earthy bases, and an abundant supply of atmospheric air. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/> These conditions are fulfilled in practice by the construction of heaps containing earths and putrefiable substances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>A clay surface is selected, and a heap formed of loose porous earth, mixed with old mortar, air slacked lime, soft porus limestone, wood ashes, &#x0026;c., and interstratified with vegetable matters, such as corn stalks, tobacco stalks, sun-flower stems, &#x0026;c., and various sorts of animal refuse, such as putrid meat, blood from slaughter houses, leather clippings, street scrapings, excrements, &#x0026;c. The heap thus formed is kept moist by such liquids as urine, meat washings, suds of soft soap, or any other putrefiable solution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Holes are made through it to admit the air and liquids to the centre of the mass, and it is frequently turned over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>When a white efflorescence appears upon the surface it is scraped off, and so, as the ripening goes on, the heaps gredually diminish in size.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The earth removed is subjected to a treatment by itself in new heaps for the purpose of concentrating the nitre prior to lixiviation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>The most convenient size for these heaps is <measure n="6feet" type="distance">six feet</measure> high, <num value="6">six</num> or <num value="7">seven</num> wide, and <num value="15">fifteen</num> long.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>It is estimated that <num value="12">twelve</num> cubic fathoms of such earth will yield an annual product of a <num value="100">hundred</num> weight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>An estimate can be easily made from these data of the extent to which it is desirable to carry this process.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>It is customary to arrange a number of these heaps beside each other, leaving sufficient space between them for convenience of working.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>They must of course be protected from drenching rains and from floods, at the same time that they are fully exposed to the air. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> An improvement upon this plan has been introduced in <placeName key="tgn,7016786" n="1.000 5" reg="prussia">Prussia</placeName>, by which the process is rendered continuous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>The heaps are there constructed with perpendicular sides towards the wind, but on the opposite face, in a serves of steps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The watering all taking place upon the leeward side, and the drying on the windward side, not only causes a capillary flow in that direction, but also concentrates the nitre upon that face.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>The effloresced earth is scraped off from the last named surface, mixed with new decomposing matter, and added to the shelves or steps.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>In this manner, while the heap always retains its form, and constantly furnishes nitre, It is slowly but steadily changing its position. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/> <num value="2">2</num>. <hi rend="italics">As to the probable production of nitre.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/> <num value="4">Four</num> heaps of the viz, mentioned, viz: <num value="6">six</num> by <measure n="105squarefeet" type="area"><measure n="7feet" type="distance">seven</measure> by <measure n="15feet" type="distance">fifteen feet</measure></measure>, would produce above a <num value="100">hundred</num> weight of nitre. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/> <num value="3">3</num>. <hi rend="italics">As to the time required for ripening.</hi> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/> This varies from <num value="2">two</num> to <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure>. Upon the <name>Prussian</name> plan, the lixiviation of nitre can be commenced sooner than this, because a sort of concentration, as already stated, takes place upon the windward wall, so that it is not necessary to wait for the conversion of the entire heap. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/> This will certainly not be greater than that of the ordinary heaps of barn-yard manure.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> Upon an examination of the above communications, it will be seen that the time required for the production of nitre (or saltpetre) from artificial beds is much greater than from the nitrous earths found in caves, although upon thorough investigation it has been ascertained that even from artificial beds in the more Southern latitudes of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, the process requires a much shorter period than in <placeName reg="Prussia" key="tgn,7016786">Prussia</placeName> or <placeName reg="Sverige" key="tgn,1000097">Sweden</placeName>, or the <rs>Northern</rs> portions of our own country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>It is estimated that within <measure n="12months" type="date">twelve months</measure> from the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> formation of the beds, saltpetre, ready for use in the manufacture of powder, can be procured in <placeName reg="South Carolina" key="tgn,7007712">South Carolina</placeName>, <placeName reg="Georgia" key="tgn,7007248">Georgia</placeName>, <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, <placeName reg="Louisiana" key="tgn,7007256">Louisiana</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Texas" key="tgn,7007826">Texas</placeName>; but to encourage the investment of labor and capital in this business, and to cover contingencies, the <rs>Government</rs> proposes to take, at <measure n="50cents" type="currency">fifty cents</measure> per pound, all saltpetre made in this way until the <date value="1864-01-01">1st of January, 1864.</date> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/> The propriety of the difference in price fixed by the <rs>Government</rs> will be obvious upon a moment's reflection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>If it was proposed to purchase at <measure n="50cents" type="currency">fifty cents</measure> per pound all saltpetre <hi rend="italics">delivered</hi> prior to <date value="1864-01">January, 1864,</date> and the blockade should be raised withing that period, importers could procure it abroad at <num value="6">six</num> or <measure n="7cents" type="currency">seven cents</measure>, and realize incalculable profits.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>If all saltpetre <hi rend="italics">made</hi> within the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, from <hi rend="italics">nitrous earths,</hi> commanded the same price for that period, as the process is much less expensive than the artificial <num value="1">one</num>, and requires a much shorter time, enormous amounts would be made by that method, should the war terminate speedily, and the <rs>Government</rs> would be compelled to fulfil its contract, although having no need of the amount furnished, and thereby incurring a heavy and unnecessary expense; but, if for what is made from artificial beds, the period of purchase was less, there would be no inducement to embark in it, as the limitation must expire before the saltpetre could be prepared and furnished. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/> We have called attention to this matter in the earnest hope and belief that our people will eagerly embrace the liberal offers of the <rs>Government</rs>, and while subserving their own pecuniary interests, advance the highest interests of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>. </p> </div4> </div3>

<head>The spirit of the <rs>South</rs>.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/> The natural depression which followed the recent reverses to our arms has passed away from the public mind, and the <rs>South</rs> is now looking full in the face all the trials and perils of its situation, and accepting with stern determination the alternative which is really and truly presented to it, of <q>&#x0022;Liberty or Death.&#x0022;</q> It has always been evident and it is now more clearly seen than ever by the <rs>Southern</rs> people that we are dealing with a foe who does not even know the meaning of magnanimity, and that we have no hope on earth for anything which earth has dear, except in the most united, determined, and unending resistance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>The triumph of the <rs>North</rs> means the ruin of the <rs>South</rs>, in property, life, liberty, and honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>It means the spoliation of all we own, the confiscation of every dollar's worth of property, the emancipation of the serf and the enslavement of the master.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>The enormous debt which the <rs>North</rs> has contracted to carry on this bloody war &mdash; a debt which cannot be less this moment than <num value="1200">twelve hundred</num> <num value="1000000">millions</num> of dollars, will be saddled entirely upon the <rs>South</rs>, in the event of its subjugation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>In will be wrung from Southern staples by heavy export duties, and from the <rs>Southern</rs> people by grinding taxes, which will condemn Southern industry in every shape and form to the most terrible burthens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>It will take from us all that we have &mdash; not only liberty, and property, and personal security, but the respect of all the world, and even our own self-respect.--We should not only be trempled down and beggared, but disgraced and degraded in the eyes of all mankind.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>If we achieve our independence, thought it cost us hundreds of <num value="1000000">millions</num>, and though it leave us poor, we shall be able again to begin the world with a soil whose rich products are our own with the spirit and energies of freemen, and with the inspiring influence of hope to cheer our hearts and animate our exertions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>But if we succumb to Northern domination, we are reduced to a lower depth of poverty than any successful sacrifice for independence can cost us and lose besides honor and hope.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>We shall be the <unclear>Parialie</unclear> of civilization, the scorn and contempt of all mankind, the loathing and self-reproach even of our own hearts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>The Southern mind comprehends all this, and it has resolved to perish rather </p> <milestone unit="column" n="4"/>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>They can die, and they can die with dignity and glory, but they will never live to be slaves.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>In this sublime resolution they have rendered their subjugation an impossibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>Such a people cannot be conquered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> shall not take our country from us, our homes, our liberty, our farms, our wives and children, our honor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/> The excessive exultations of the <rs>Northern</rs> communities, the illuminations, cannon firings, and hurrahs of their populace over their recent victories, illustrate strongly the characteristic want of sobriety and self-respect in the public mind of that section.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="85"/>Its moderation in the hour of triumph was as signal as its valor in the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>We envy not the character which can lose its balance and rush into a delirium of delight because <num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num> men have defeated <num value="2500">twenty-five hundred</num> at <placeName reg="Roanoke Island, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014345">Roanoke Island</placeName>, and <num value="80000">eighty thousand</num> have proved too strong for <num value="15000">fifteen thousand</num> at <placeName key="tgn,7017741" n="1.000 165" reg="fort donelson, stewart, tennessee">Fort Donelson</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/>It is evident that no land force could be brought against the city from the neighboring coast until the gunboats had reasonable hope of being able to reduce the batteries along the river and compelling our troops to retire. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/> The attack of a flotilla of gunboats without a preconcerted movement of the land force, would also be utterly useless since the shelling out the batteries and the command of the river would advantage them but little, not being able to hold the place.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>What, then, is their intention in moving so insidiously along the river?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>I am of the opinion that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> intend to triangulate the river with their batteries until they have completely invested <placeName reg="Fort Jackson, Plaquemines, Louisiana" key="tgn,2335345">Fort Jackson</placeName> from both sides of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>Of course, our supporting batteries, and numerous ones also, are there about, but they will have attained a concentrated fire from batteries on both sides and from their gunboats in the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>Such an attack would be formidable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="127"/>As I said before, I believe we will drive them back even then, but they must not be allowed to progress thus far. They have now <num value="3">three</num> points on the river, commanding effectually the channel, and the next they will establish on <placeName reg="Alvarado Island">Alvarado Island</placeName>, and so progress up the river. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="128"/> On <placeName reg="Alvarado Island">Alvarado Island</placeName> the fight will have to come off; they cannot be allowed to quietly remain on that place; we must, indeed, precede them and make the attempt at lodgment a bloody trial.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/>The island is marshy, in fact, <num value="1">one</num> extensive rice field, with but low embankments to kick back the tidal flow, but upon it a force of infantry can be able to keep in check any force of the enemy not so numerous as to overpower them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/>A fair field is what we want and what the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> strive to avoid as much as possible.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/>I trust the chance may happen. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/> In my last letter I spoke of the <orgName n="Floating Battery" type="battery">floating battery</orgName>, and in my preceding <num value="1">one</num> also of the same subject; the matter has not gone quite dead yet. The authorities of the <rs>State</rs> are moving about the building, and the <rs>Confederate</rs> officers hereabouts also are in council on the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/>I believe the battery will be built, the best plan submitted being taken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="134"/>It is a matter of regret that this work had not been started sooner; it would have relieved the present vigorous blockade of <placeName key="tgn,2024563" n="1.000 48" reg="tybee island, tybee island, chatham, georgia">Fort Pulaski</placeName>, and have kept the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> in wholesome terror of the iron monster; it can be built now in time with diligence and assiduity on the part of those who will undertake the work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="135"/>I heard an officer say that <measure n="30days" type="date">thirty days</measure> was the limit at which he fixed the attack, and that would suffice for the completion of it. If the scheme of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> General is what I have above outlined, it will be fully <measure n="30days" type="date">thirty days</measure>, nay more, before he is ready to attack <placeName reg="Fort Jackson, Plaquemines, Louisiana" key="tgn,2335345">Fort Jackson</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/> To-day, the appointed day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer, was generally observed in our churches and our city; nowadays very quiet, was unusually so Next Friday is the day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer, appointed by the <rs>Governor</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="137"/>We shall have enough humiliation to do us a long while, I fear, if any more appointments are visited upon us. I would not be profane, or on any account wish our total dependence on Almighty <name n="God" type="God">God</name> not to be recognized; nay, publicly acknowledged, but I will merely say that I trust our people are not imitating the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> with their grand revivals, in which they periodically acknowledge their dependence on <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, which they in the <unclear><hi rend="italics">intarius</hi></unclear> virtually deny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="138"/>I hope something will be done besides prayer for the good of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="139"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> only assists those who help themselves, and if the calls are extended more frequently for humiliations, the men, I fear, will stay at home to pray instead of fighting for the good of the <rs>Confederacy</rs>. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/> Falsehood is <num value="1">one</num> great agent of the invation and attempt at subjugation of the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>Duplicity and dissimulation are auxiliary agencies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>By falsehood the public opinion of <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> is to be monided, and the people of the <rs>South</rs> to be alarmed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>The Northern armies and armaments are represented as the most gigantic and irresistible &mdash; the plans of the war for subjugation are deseribed as complete and ensuring the speedy and certain crushing of the <q>&#x0022;rebellion&#x0022;</q>--the achievements of their iron-clad gunboats on the waters are said to be a sample of the closing in of the folde of the anaconda which is so crush us <q>&#x0022;out,&#x0022;</q> (as the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> say)--their victories are magnified &mdash; the number of their prisoners exaggerated &mdash; leading and prominent Southern men are crawfishing out of the <q>&#x0022;rebellion&#x0022;</q>--their flag is said to be hailed with joy in the <rs>South</rs>--<placeName reg="Tennessee" key="tgn,7007825">Tennessee</placeName> is getting ready, through her Legislature, to submit to <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00102" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>These, with innumerable other lies and exaggerations, are spread over the <rs>North</rs> and sent to <placeName key="tgn,1000003" n="1.000 139" reg="europe,">Europe</placeName> for effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>They are put forth with such boasting as none but braggarts could indulge.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>No nation that ever existed could equal the <rs>Northern</rs> people in this department of their hostilities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>The <rs>Chinese</rs> were as nothing to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>The false statements about their battles were mere feeble efforts at misrepresentation, compared to those of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>; and their regiments of painted and disfigured men, with gongs and belis, and every species of dissonance to strike terror to the enemy, were lame devices by the side of the ingenious tricks of our <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> enemies to terrify the <rs>South</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/> Their arts of duplicity and dissimulation are equally cunning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="265"/>In these they emulate the disgusting creature which, by their <unclear>relec on,</unclear> they use to illustrate their movement upon the <rs>South</rs>--their <q>&#x0022;crushing out rebellion&#x0022;</q> in the folds of the constrictor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="266"/>The <unclear>bo </unclear> basking in the sunshine, fixes his eye upon the beentifal little red deer of the <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> mountains, and proceeds to decoy him by his fascinations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/>The moment the little animal meats the glance of the boa's eyes, and pauses to look at them, his fate is sealed.--He gambols a little, recedes, and advances, ever diminishing the previous space between himself and his fate upon each return, until he is seized and wrapped in the folds of the monster whose spells he was powerless to resist.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>The Northern serpent who has penetrated the <rs>Southern Even</rs>, attempts his natural arts.--At Hatteres, and <placeName reg="East Nashville, Davidson, Tennessee" key="tgn,2308580">Nashville</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Roanoke Island, Dare, North Carolina" key="tgn,7014345">Roanoke Island</placeName> he shows his brightest hues and assumes his quietest and most innocent sirs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>He proposes to harm no <num value="1">one</num>--to disturb nobody's private rights &mdash; and only to restore quiet and security to the land &mdash; Were we simple and irrational like the little red deer, we must naturally fall a prey to his natural arts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>But can be decoy Southern people by such duplicity, such cherming.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>Are they to forget the burning houses, the confiscated property, the stolen and liberated servants of Southern people ? Will they forget the ernelties practised upon our loyal and true citizens, the brutal treatment of women and shildren by the ruthless inrader!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>Is <hi rend="italics">Southern blood,</hi> shed in their defence, to be forgotten, and sink into the ground unavenged !--<dateStruct><month>May</month></dateStruct>, can they forget the cause of the <name>Separation</name> of the <rs>South</rs> from the <rs>North</rs>--or Even Think of the <name>Possibility</name> of Reconstruction ? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/> To listen to the enemy, to <hi rend="italics">think, even, of forgetting these things,</hi> would be fetal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>Once in his power, we would indeed be <q>&#x0022;<hi rend="italics">crashed out.</hi>&#x0022;</q> Our property would be confiscated and passed over to the possession of our conquerers &mdash; our sacred boundaries would be blotted from the map, and our States be no more known to the world &mdash; ruined, down-trodden, disgrased forever in the eyes of the world, so that our children would fain disown their parents, the very night of our poor country would be intolerable to us, and those of us who were able would wander away from the land of our birth to find what relief we might in stranger climes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>Those that remained would welcome death as a friend to close their eyes and their memories upon events and scenes fraught only with dishonor and misery for them ! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>This is what the <rs>Northern Serpent</rs> would do!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>Can he ? Shall be ! The response of a free people, who deserve to be free, will be given before this war is over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>And all the falsehoods and all the cherming arts of the most artful and unscrupulous of foes that ever waged a war, will be dissolved like the <q>&#x0022;baseless fabric of a vision.&#x0022;</q> </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>It is compulsory submission in the <num value="1">one</num> case as in the other.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>In point of fact, <placeName reg="West Virginia" key="tgn,7013961">Western Virginia</placeName> has shown itself more restless under <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> domination than any other portion of the <rs>State</rs> occupied by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/>No people have suffered more and endured more than the loyal <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginians</rs> in the <rs>Northwest</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>If our military leaders, in the beginning of the war, had adopted efficient means for the occupation of the <rs>Northwest</rs>, and for giving protection to its loyal inhabitants, the whole section would now be free from the pollution of <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> footsteps, embattled in a solid host under the <orgName n="Southern Banner" type="newspaper">Southern banner</orgName>, and carrying the war into the enemy's country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/>There is no braver and more high spirited race any-where than the people of the <rs>Northwest</rs>--a people who, if not as authusiastic and demonstrative as others, have no superior in strength of will and nerve, and in gennine devotion to the principles of liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>We hope yet to see the day when the <name>Pierpont</name> dynasty and its <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> bayonets will be driven across the <rs>Ohio</rs>, and our gallant Northwestern population relse their heads as proudly as their own mountain tops above the fogs and mists which how envelope them. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="769"/>He lived near <placeName reg="Lyon, Rhone, Rhone-Alpes" key="tgn,7008772">Lyons</placeName>, and his practice for several years past, it appears, has been to go to the city frequently and secure his victims in the following manner: Meeting a girl who looked like a servant, he would inquire of her the way to an <orgName n="Intelligence Office" type="office">intelligence office</orgName> and, getting into conversation with her, would state that he was employed at a chateau a few miles in the country, and that he was in search of a servant girl, to whom very superior wages would be paid.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="770"/>It the girl whom he accested was looking for a place she would generally accept his offer, and they would start out on the cars together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="771"/>Dumollard so contrived it that they should reach the station at which they were to descend after dark, when he would shoulder the girl's truck or box, and start with her across the fields. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="772"/> Arrived at a convenient spot he would violate her, kill her, and bury her, and take the trunk to his house.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="773"/>Finally, a girl becoming frightened, asked him, as they were walking through the woods, if they were not nearly arrived at the chateau.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="774"/>Dumollard replied they were, but that he would hide the truck among the trees, as it was very heavy, and would come for it in the morning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="775"/>He put down the trunk, and as the girl started to run, he threw a sort of running noose over her head.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="776"/>She succeeded in escaping, however, and giving information to the police authorities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="777"/>Dumollard was watched, and finally his house was searched, when the following articles of female clothing were found <num value="35">Thirty-five</num> pairs of gaiters, <num value="67">sixty-seven</num> pairs of stockings, <num value="38">thirty-eight</num> caps, <num value="10">ten</num> pairs of stays, <num value="71">seventy-one</num> handkerchiefs, a number of collars, chemisettes; etc., amounting to <num value="1100">eleven hundred</num> articles--<num value="546">five hundred and forty-six</num> of which were recognized by girls who had been enticed in the manner above stated, but who, becoming frightened, had escaped, and by the friends of others who had been killed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="778"/> <num value="3">Three</num> or <num value="4">four</num> skelstons and bodies of females were discovered in the woods between the station and <placeName reg="Dumollard's house">Dumollard's house</placeName>, and before the examing magistrate the prisoner acknowledged that within the last <measure n="8years" type="date">eight years</measure> he had murdered <num value="6">six</num> young women, and had made attempts upon <num value="9">nine</num> others, who escaped with the loss of their clothing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="779"/>It is supposed that <num value="1">one</num> of the young women killed by this fiend was buried alive, as when found her clenched hands were filled with earth, which she had probably seized in her dying agonies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="780"/>During the trial <rs>Dumollard</rs> declared that the witnesses had formed a conspiracy to ruin him, and manifested the utmost indifference, and ate heartily and slept well.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="781"/>He was found guilty and sentenced, to death, and his wife to <measure n="20years" type="date">twenty years</measure> imprisonment at hard labor. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
