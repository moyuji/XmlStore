<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> Yesterday was another quiet day along the lines immediately below this city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>The men of the opposing armies lounged about in full sight and in easy musket range of each other without a hostile demonstration.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>The pickets sauntered listlessly under the whispering pines, every <num value="1">one</num> of them looking as though he wished devoutly that this cruel war was over. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>The garrison of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Fort Harrison</placeName> are still busily engaged constructing bomb proofs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>All their movements can be easily discerned with the naked eye from a point on our line directly in front of the fort, the distance between being scarcely <measure n="500yards" type="distance">five hundred yards</measure>. When we lost it, this was an open redoubt, situated on a hill looking southeast and commanding an extensive valley.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, since their occupation, have constructed a west face and made it an enclosed work of great strength.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>In front of it, towards our lines, may be seen <num value="1">one</num> substantial hedge of <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">cluraux de frise.</hi></foreign> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> As we have before said, all was quiet on this line yesterday, and there appeared to be no prospect of a fight.--The stillness was only broken by the reports of the guns of our gunboats and river batteries as they shelled old <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00005" reg="mostcommon:Butler,nomatch:0"><surname>Butler</surname></persName>'s workmen at <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> gap. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>We failed to obtain any confirmation of the report, and think it likely it originated in the fact, that the evening being calm, the shelling going on at <rs n="Dutch" type="group">Dutch</rs> gap could be distinctly heard in the city. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>This might have been the reports of the great &#x0022;peace maker&#x0022; planted not long since to reach the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> lines east of the city of <placeName reg="Petersburg, Petersburg, Virginia" key="tgn,7014404">Petersburg</placeName>, where they heretofore considered themselves safe. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>This weapon has the improved musket barrel, but is chambered, and fires twice without reloading.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>It is an ingenious piece of workmanship, and is said to be a very superior weapon.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Many of these guns have been captured from the enemy and placed in the hands of our skirmishers and sharpshooters, and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have been made to feel the weight of their metal. </p> </div4>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/> We must decline to engage in a controversy with the <hi rend="italics"><rs n="Whig" type="political">Whig</rs></hi> upon a matter so delicate and so well calculated to stir up party animosities at a time like the present, when it is of the last importance that dissensions should be avoided.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>It can see no difference between the letter of <persName n="Johnson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00185" reg="mostcommon:Johnson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName> and those of <persName n="Brown,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00186" reg="nearbymention:Brown,P.,W.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>, <persName n="Stephens,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00187" reg="nearbymention:Stephens,John,W.,,"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Stephens</surname></persName> and <persName n="Boyce,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00188" reg="mostcommon:Boyce,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Boyce</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>We see a very great difference &mdash; a difference which is vital to the point in question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/><persName n="Johnson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00189" reg="mostcommon:Johnson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName> distinctly declares that this is not a time to make propositions, when the enemy scornfully refuse to receive even a message from us, and when he is holding the sword over heads, offering us the alternative of abject submission or total extirpation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>He thinks, more-over, that inasmuch as we are the party assailed, the proposal for a settlement of difficulties should not come from us.--We do not understand the other gentlemen in question to have presented any such view of the case as this, and their not having done so, creates a very great distinction, with a very wide difference. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/> We are free to say, however, that we have left an inference to be drawn from our language which we did not intend, and which we overlooked in the haste of writing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>We did not mean, nor do we think, that <persName n="Brown,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00190" reg="nearbymention:Brown,P.,W.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName>, <persName n="Stephens,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00191" reg="nearbymention:Stephens,John,W.,,"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Stephens</surname></persName> and <persName n="Boyce,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00192" reg="mostcommon:Boyce,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister"></roleName><surname>Boyce</surname></persName> deliberately aim at reconstruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>What we designed to impress was, that the policy they recommend must inevitably lead to that issue; nor do we see how it can, if successful, result in anything else.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>To the objection of the <hi rend="italics"><rs n="Whig" type="political">Whig</rs></hi> that such remarks as ours give the enemy encouragement, &#x0026;c., we can only reply that, in our judgment, the course of these gentlemen is far better calculated to produce that mischief than anything we have said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>To prove that we are not mistaken, it is only necessary to point to the proposal made by <persName n="Sherman,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00193" reg="mostcommon:Sherman,nomatch:0"><surname>Sherman</surname></persName> to <num value="1">one</num> of them, and that <num value="1">one</num> the <rs>Governor</rs> of a Sovereign State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>What but the impression, derived from his previous language, that he was ready to cut his State loose from the <rs>Confederacy</rs>, and that the <rs>State</rs> was ready to go with him?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/>And farther, what can be more deplorable than the spectacle of a Governor, instead of treating such a proposal with silent contempt, taking the occasion to make a speech, and in that speech arraigning the conduct of the <rs>Confederate Administration</rs> and dilating upon the wrongs of his own State?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>And before what tribunal is this arraignment made?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/>Before a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> general, in the heart of his State, at the head of an army <num value="50000">fifty thousand</num> strong!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="260"/>Really, if our paragraphs encourage the enemy, we are at a loss to say what sort of feeling a proceeding like this creates.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="261"/>It must be that of exultation, bordering upon triumph.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="262"/>To the best of our recollection, he even went so far as to intimate very strongly, if he did not directly say, that matters could not be settled until we and the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> had gotten rid of <placeName reg="Jeff Davis, Georgia, United States" key="tgn,2000371">Jeff Davis</placeName> and <persName n="Lincoln,,Abe,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00196" reg="default:Lincoln,Abe,,,"><foreName>Abe</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/>And this to a <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> general.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>The rule of the law is, we believe, that he who consents to plead in a court acknowledges its jurisdiction.
