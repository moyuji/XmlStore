<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/> The people are responding with alacrity to the call of the <rs>President</rs> for more men. * * * But the process of collecting a volunteer force is necessarily slow in comparison with the present necessities of the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>It is certain that if <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> could be at once attacked by an adequate force it must fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/>The enemy suffered very severely in the recent battles; he is for the moment prostrated; he needs time to prepare himself for another conflict; and he will use, with the utmost energy, every hour we give him. To reap, therefore, the fruits of the conflicts of last week, we need to place at once in the field, and put in active operation, and army sufficient to fall upon the weakened and suffering forces of the enemy and destroy them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/> To do this in time <hi rend="italics">we must resort to a draft.</hi> In this way each State can fill up at once the thinned regiments it has now in the field, and the new recruits, placed among the veterans of the campaign, will be immediately turned into soldiers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>We hear of many regiments which have but <num value="150">one hundred and fifty</num> to <num value="250">two hundred and fifty</num> men left.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="255"/>But these are inexperienced soldiers; they and their companions, now in the hospitals, or left dead on the field, have earned for these regiments a fame which the fresh recruits, who should fill out their ranks, would have a pride in sustaining.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="256"/>Thus a spirit of emulation is bred in the young soldier which he will not so readily have if he is surrounded only by men as new to war as himself. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="257"/> Moreover, in this way the brave fellows who have so unflinchingly borne the brunt of the recent battles on the <rs type="place">Peninsula</rs>, and have distinguished themselves in the ranks, would have a chance for that promotion which the soldier looks forward to as the highest reward, and which gives to the private in the ranks the ambition to do daring deeds against the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="258"/>But above all, we repeat, a draft to fill up the old regiments, and even to form immediately new regiments, would, without loss of time, and with the slightest preliminary drill and preparation, put an effective army into the field. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="259"/> It is no matter for surprise that the <rs>Confederates</rs> have many men. They draft.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="263"/> An advantage in making a draft for the new forces which are so urgently needed will be only that the best men will be accepted by the recruiting officers; whereas, under the present system of enlistments, the inspections are too often lax, and men gathered at random by officers who must bring a certain number in order to secure their own commissions, are admitted without due care to see that they are all really able-bodied and efficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="264"/>In consequence, many are afterwards discharged, after having been a source of expense to the <rs>Government</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/> If, as we fear, the country must abandon all hope that <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00097" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Bob,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> will make a change in his Cabinet; if this proof of the adoption of a more vigorous war policy, with new men and new measures for the crushing out of the rebellion, is denied to the people whose interests and all whose earthly hopes are at stake; if the <rs>President</rs> has, after full deliberation, finally determined to give no such response to the all but unanimous voice of the people, pronouncing their profound discontent with the present conduct of affairs, then it behooves us to consider what is the next best or necessary thing to be done. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/> The decision of the <rs>President</rs> will be submitted to, if its wisdom cannot be seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>This is no mob government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>It is constitutional monarchies which in this century have been at the mercy of mobs.--Neither <persName n="Phillips,,Wendell,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00098" reg="default:Phillips,Wendell,,,"><foreName>Wendell</foreName> <surname>Phillips</surname></persName> nor the <rs>Satanic Press</rs> will persuade <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> citizens to play the <name>Cromwell</name> role.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>That was possible in <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName>; it is not possible here.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/><placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 1835" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> was also mobbed into the <rs>Trent</rs> war craze.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/>In <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> public opinion was all <num value="1">one</num> way. But <persName n="Seward,Secretary,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00099" reg="mostcommon:Seward,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Secretary">Secretary</roleName> <surname>Seward</surname></persName>'s dispatch, and its opposite judgment, had prompt and universal acquiescence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>There was no mob government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>Partially enlightened public opinion and a strong public feeling even did not govern.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>It was the <rs>Government</rs> which governed, and that was what it was made and its officers were elected to do. So now, though <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00100" reg="nearbymention:Lincoln,Bob,,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> has never hitherto thus tried the patience nor so overruled the fixed judgment of the people, his high office is respected and his decision stands.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>Upon him rests the responsibility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="286"/>None can decide for him. He alone can pronounce the word which would give new heart and life to the nation in this hour and crisis of its fate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>Either he does not perceive the crisis or another remedy seems to him wisest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>Then let his judgment stand. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="289"/> That we do not so conceive the situation, so understand the nation's peril, or judge of the mode of deliverance, it is needless to deny.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="290"/>Our distrust in the future, it must be admitted, is profound, without new men and new measures to work the ship of State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="291"/><name n="God" type="God">God</name> grant that coming events may prove us blind and mistaken, or that His overruling care may so order our disasters as to work out such beneficent results for us as human eyes cannot foresee.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="292"/>But we have no factious words to utter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="293"/>Others may not be content to rest their advocacy for other men and other measures, where we believe it should rest &mdash; with the final decision of the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="294"/>To us it seems equally the dictate of patriotism and of common sense to accept his decision, and to proceed to that which is next best and most necessary to be done. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="295"/> What, then, is the situation?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="296"/>The fact stares us in the face that the people believe their blood and treasure to have been wasted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/>They believe that the mismanagement of the <orgName n="Treasury Department" type="department">Treasury Department</orgName> has cost the nation as much as the expenses of the war, and that it will cost us more.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>They believe that the feebleness of the <orgName n="Navy Department" type="department">Navy Department</orgName> not only crippled our Navy and our commerce, but, by leaving <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName> in the hands of the <rs>Confederates</rs>, reinforced their armies with money and the munitions of war, which have augmented their victories and lightened their defeats, and sustained to this hour an otherwise almost hopeless cause.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>They believe that the blunders of the <orgName n="War Department" type="department">War Department</orgName> have crippled our <rs type="role2">Generals</rs>, botched their campaigns, and insured us disaster.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>They see to-day such danger of foreign intervention as has never before dared to menace us, and fear that they may be asked to rally to arms against a foreign foe, powerful on sea and land against perhaps a foreign alliance which might defy the world beside in arms, by the men who have been unable to conquer our feebler foe at home.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>In the face of these facts, in face of the need for men to reap the peaceful harvests of our fields, in face of the need for workmen to supply the places of those who have gone to wield in the battle field the scythe of war, the country is asked for <num value="300000">three hundred thousand</num> more volunteers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/> The <num value="300000">three hundred thousand</num> may be called, but they will not come.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>At least enlistments will not be sufficiently numerous or prompt to insure the nation's success or safety.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>The result thus far proves it. The result of the next <measure n="10days" type="date">ten days</measure> recruiting will make it so palpable that none can fail to see it. This fact must be looked at. It is of no use to blind our eyes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>The people may consent to acquiesce in the decision of the <rs>President</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>They will not consent to shut their eyes to its results.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>It would be sheer folly not to foresee what is inevitable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>Their determination that the rebellion shall be put down is as unalterable to-day as it was <num value="1">one</num> year ago. What, then, is to be done?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>Without reinforcing our armies promptly &mdash; without making a speedy conquest of the <rs>Confederate Capital</rs>, (to say nothing of the prolongation of the war, its miseries, and its expense,) we shall, in all those objects which we hope to accomplish by the war, fail.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>The failure of our army to take <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> must be retrieved by its prompt capture, or the danger of foreign intervention doubles daily.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>The failure to hold the seacoast which we have taken and occupied, the failure to possess and occupy the channels through which free communication and valuable supplies from abroad are still had by the <rs>Confederates</rs>; the failure to occupy every Southern seaport, will give to intervention its sharpest sting and its most disastrous practical effect.--We can check mate the plans of our enemies abroad and conquer the enemy at home only by an immediate and generous reinforcement of our armies. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/> The call for volunteers under present circumstances will not accomplish this end. But the end </p> <milestone unit="column" n="6"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/> must be reached &mdash; if not in <num value="1">one</num> way, then in another.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>There is no other way but to resort to drafting, and the sooner this is done the better.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>Let the <rs>Government</rs> not hesitate a single week.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>Let it not consider the question whether we can afford to let things remain <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">in statu quo</hi></foreign> till the warm weather is over.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>Let the <rs>President</rs> believe that even though foreign Powers tolerate the delay, the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> people will not. There must be no interruption in the prosecution of the war. We cannot wage it at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> against an army which more than doubles our own. We must reinforce, and there is no way to reinforce with sufficient promptitude except by drafting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> does not need the <rs>Governors</rs> to tell him this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>He need not aggravate his voice in telling it to the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>Let him rely upon the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>They will sustain him if he deals with them honestly and tells them the whole truth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>This is the people's war. Their hearts are in it.--And although <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> ago a <num value="1000000">million</num> volunteers might have been had, they will not to-day complain if <num value="300000">three hundred thousand</num> are selected by draft. </p> </div4>

<head>The panic in <rs type="color">Gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs>.<lb/>[from the <rs>New York Post</rs>.]</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/> With each day the scarcity of change grows greater.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>Gold has quite disappeared from sight, and brings in the market a premium of <num value="0.16">sixteen percent.</num> Silver is worth <measure n="107cents" type="currency">107 cents</measure> on the dollar, and even nickel cents bring a premium of <num value="1">one</num> to <num value="0.02">two per cent.</num> An application made to the <rs>Sub Treasury</rs> in this city to-day for a <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">hundred dollars'</measure> worth of nickel cents in return for <measure n="100dollars" type="currency">one hundred dollars</measure> in Treasury notes was refused, as is <rs type="color">gold</rs> and <rs type="color">silver</rs> &mdash; because the specie was at a premium.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/>Even the clumsy copper cent is becoming scarce, and will soon demand a premium, while a month ago cents of all kinds were at a discount. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/> A number of restaurant keepers, who at <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> held out against the inevitable change, have during the past few days, been obliged to practically suspend specie payment, and to offer to their guests shinplasters of paper or pasteboard, good for specified amounts.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>The barbers have done the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>On the city cars and omnibuses bills are refused, but change is given for specie.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>Our retail dealers are doing a poor business, because they prefer holding on to their goods rather than sell them at a ruinous discount.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>In some places notices are posted stating that the purchaser must pay for his change; for instance, if he buys an article priced at <measure n="25cents" type="currency">25 cents</measure>, he is expected to give <measure n="27cents" type="currency">27 cents</measure> therefore, if change is made. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="331"/> This thing, however, cannot go on much longer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="332"/>Regular customers will accept from courtesy shin-plasters from those with whom they deal daily; but this will not suit the general public, which demands not a series of individual notes receivable, but a circulating medium which will be recognized by every <num value="1">one</num> in the vicinity at least where it is issued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="333"/>Already the operations of trade are seriously embarrassed by the scarcity of change, and there appears to be no adequate relief for annoyed sellers and buyers in the private shinplaster system, even if carried to the furthest extent. </p> </div4>

<head>Talking out.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="334"/> The Massachusetts Abolitionists don't mince matters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>They talk right out. The <placeName reg="Essex, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1002362">Essex County</placeName> Anti-<orgName n="Slavery Society" type="society">Slavery Society</orgName> held a meeting on the <date value="06-15">15th June,</date> and passed the following resolutions: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/> <hi rend="italics">Resolved,</hi> That as Abolitionists, devoted to the great work of overthrowing slavery, we renew and repeat our old pledge, &#x0022;No Union with Slaveholders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="337"/>No support of any Administration or Government that permits slavery on any portion of its soil; and we value this war only as we believe it must lead to emancipation by order of the <rs>Federal</rs> authorities, or to a dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs>, which must speedily produce the same result. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="338"/> <hi rend="italics">Resolved,</hi> That the war, as hitherto prosecuted, is but a wanton waste of property, a dreadful sacrifice of life, and, what is worse than all, of conscience and character, to preserve and perpetuate a <orgName n="Union and Constitution" type="newspaper">Union and Constitution</orgName> which should never have existed, and which, by all the laws of justice and humanity, should, in their present form, be at once and forever overthrown. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/> These are the resolutions of men who denounce <rs n="Democrat" type="political">Democrats</rs> as traitors, and who get up mobs, tar and feather citizens who contend for the <rs>Constitution</rs> as it is and the <rs>Union</rs> as it was, and whose only other offence is that they denounce Abolitionists as enemies of the country.
