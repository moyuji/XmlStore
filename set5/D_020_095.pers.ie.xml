<milestone unit="sentence" n="174"/> Patting out of the question all considerations of policy; laying aside the well known fact that the health of troops is some what important to the winning of victories, and is so considered in all civilized countries; that even the physical condition of slaves is a subject of constant attention to the master, who feels it to be his interest as well as duty to have his negroes carefully housed, well fed, and when they are sick, taken good care of, and attended by skillful surgeons, and not by miserable pretenders and quacks; that even horses, oxen, and mules are looked after by their masters and owners, carefully protected from the weather, and from everything that may impair their efficiency,--putting aside, we say, the question of policy, we demand to know whether the sick soldiers of the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="176"/>We do not say that this is the universal treatment; it may be, and probably is, exceptional, but these exceptions it all we hear be true, are a good many more than are required to establish a general rule.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="684"/> The proceedings of this body, which is now in session in <placeName reg="Columbia, Richland, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013641">Columbia, S. C.</placeName>, is somewhat interesting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="686"/> <persName n="Elliott,Bishop,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00357" reg="nearbymention:Elliott,J.,T.,,"><roleName n="Bishop">Bishop</roleName> <surname>Elliott</surname></persName> presented some considerations in favor of the adoption of the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> article, viz: <q>&#x0022;This Church shall be called the <orgName n="Protestant Episcopal Church" type="church">Protestant Episcopal Church</orgName> in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States of America</placeName>.&#x0022;</q> He though it inexpedient to make changes unless absolutely required.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="687"/>The identity of the <rs type="place">Church</rs> might be more or less called in question, and questions in regard to property might arise, and litigation ensue. </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="689"/> <persName n="Trapier,Reverend-Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00359" reg="mostcommon:Trapier,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Reverend-Mister">Rev.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="690"/> <persName n="Green,Bishop,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00360" reg="nearbymention:Green,S.,S.,,"><roleName n="Bishop">Bishop</roleName> <surname>Green</surname></persName> considered the term <rs n="Protestant" type="religion">Protestant</rs> unmeaning from its generality, and that it involved the <rs type="place">Church</rs> in the odium of the follies and heresies of various sects.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="691"/>Episcopal, as a term, was not distinctive, because there were other Episcopal bodies.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="692"/>He preferred the title <q>&#x0022;The <orgName n="American Catholic Church" type="church">American <rs n="Catholic" type="religion">Catholic</rs> Church</orgName>.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="693"/> <persName n="Williams,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00361" reg="mostcommon:Williams,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Williams</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, glorified in the term <rs n="Protestant" type="religion">Protestant</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="694"/>Does the <rs type="place">Church</rs> still protest?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="695"/>The Articles are explicit upon that point, and any change of the kind advocated would subject the <rs type="place">Church</rs> to suspicion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="696"/> <persName n="Hines,Reverend-Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00362" reg="mostcommon:Hines,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Reverend-Mister">Rev.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="697"/>In the creed we professed to believe in the <orgName n="Catholic Church" type="church">Catholic Church</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="698"/>He wanted a name which would take us back to the days of the <name>Saviour</name> and apostles. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="699"/> <persName n="Fairbanks,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00363" reg="mostcommon:Fairbanks,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Fairbanks</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Florida" key="tgn,7007240">Florida</placeName>, was at a loss to discover how <rs n="Protestant" type="religion">Protestant</rs> came to be applied as a name to the <rs type="place">Church</rs> &mdash; it was superfluous.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="700"/>The argument to retain it upon the ground of expediency was wholly untenable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="701"/>They were not to regard expediency; it was the lowest ground of action. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="702"/> <persName n="Mason,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00364" reg="mostcommon:Mason,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Mason</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="North Carolina" key="tgn,7007709">North Carolina</placeName>, had never liked the title.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="703"/>It had always seemed to him to be sectarian.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="704"/>But it was hard to get rid of. He would gladly escape from it, but the attempt might entail confusion, and require endless explanations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="705"/> <persName n="Elliott,Bishop,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00365" reg="nearbymention:Elliott,J.,T.,,"><roleName n="Bishop">Bishop</roleName> <surname>Elliott</surname></persName> would be extremely loth to strike out a term which was a standing rebuke of <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>'s peculiar assumption, that she is the <orgName n="Catholic Church" type="church">Catholic Church</orgName> of the world.--The <orgName n="English Church" type="church">English Church</orgName> gloried in it, and even the <rs>Queen</rs> had to take an oath to support the <rs n="Protestant" type="religion">Protestant</rs> religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="706"/>He would repeat what he had said in a sermon in <dateStruct value="1844--"><year reg="1844">1844</year></dateStruct>, that the <rs type="place">Church</rs> is <rs n="Catholic" type="religion">Catholic</rs> for every truth of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, and <rs n="Protestant" type="religion">Protestant</rs> against every error of man. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="707"/> <persName n="Atkinson,Bishop,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00366" reg="mostcommon:Atkinson,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Bishop">Bishop</roleName> <surname>Atkinson</surname></persName> urged that names should correspond to things.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="708"/>They should be distinctive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="709"/>He thought the term Reformed more expressive than <rs n="Protestant" type="religion">Protestant</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="710"/>The Jansenists protest, but do not reform.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="711"/>His preference was for the <name>Reformed</name> <orgName n="Catholic Church" type="church">Catholic Church</orgName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="712"/> <persName n="Trapier,Reverend-Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00367" reg="mostcommon:Trapier,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Reverend-Mister">Rev. Mr.</roleName> <surname>Trapier</surname></persName> urged that <rs n="Protestant" type="religion">Protestant</rs> Episcopal, as a designation, was now a concrete thing, and hallowed by association. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="713"/> <persName n="Davis,Bishop,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00368" reg="nearbymention:Davis,William,H.,,"><roleName n="Bishop">Bishop</roleName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> dwelt upon the inconvenience of change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="714"/>For several centuries after the <rs type="place">Church</rs> was established, it bore the title <rs n="Catholic" type="religion">Catholic</rs>, and derived character from it. Subsequently, when corruption crept in, it was not so. It became a falsehood.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="715"/><rs n="Protestant" type="religion">Protestant</rs> in due time became the true term, and gave its historic testimony to the pure and true Church.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="716"/>Viewing each in its time, <rs n="Catholic" type="religion">Catholic</rs> and <rs n="Protestant" type="religion">Protestant</rs> are in harmony.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="717"/>The term Episcopal likewise testifies to the true Government of the <rs type="place">Church</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="718"/> <persName n="Otey,Bishop,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00369" reg="mostcommon:Otey,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Bishop">Bishop</roleName> <surname>Otey</surname></persName> contended that the term <rs n="Protestant" type="religion">Protestant</rs> is derived from <placeName reg="Deutschland, Europe, " key="tgn,7000084">Germany</placeName>, and was not originally directed against errors in the <orgName n="Rome Church" type="church">Church of Rome</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="719"/>He alluded to the present war as the result, in his belief, of ultra Protestantism or <persName><foreName>Puritanism</foreName></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="720"/>He objected more particularly to the expression <q>&#x0022;in the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName>.&#x0022;</q> It was entangling. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="721"/> <persName n="Crane,Reverend-Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00370" reg="mostcommon:Crane,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Reverend-Doctor">Rev. Dr.</roleName> <surname>Crane</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522">Mississippi</placeName>, considered that to take the name Reformed <rs n="Catholic" type="religion">Catholic</rs> would be but to resume the appropriate and original title of the <rs type="place">Church</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="722"/>Cramner, <persName n="Ridley,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00371" reg="mostcommon:Ridley,nomatch:0"><surname>Ridley</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Latimer,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00372" reg="mostcommon:Latimer,nomatch:0"><surname>Latimer</surname></persName> were not <rs n="Protestant" type="religion">Protestants</rs>, they were Reformers. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="723"/> <persName n="Lay,Bishop,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00373" reg="mostcommon:Lay,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Bishop">Bishop</roleName> <surname>Lay</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Arkansas" key="tgn,7016172">Arkansas</placeName>, gave as a strong reason why the name should be retained, that its origin could not be discovered.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="724"/>Names gradually came into use. The reasons for their adoption were in the course of time lost sight of, but the necessity for retaining them continued.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="725"/>When names were changed, principles often were.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="726"/>He thought <rs n="Protestant" type="religion">protestant</rs> affirmed the position of the <rs type="place">Church</rs> in respect to the accretions of <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>, and Episcopal did so likewise as to the subtractions of other denominations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="727"/>We should also not assume a name which others could not recognise as rightfully ours, without denying their own principles. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="728"/> <persName n="Hines,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00374" reg="mostcommon:Hines,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Hines</surname></persName> said the term <rs n="Protestant" type="religion">Protestant</rs> was common to the innumerable seets who disgraced the <orgName n="Christian world" type="newspaper">Christian world</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="729"/>He moved that <rs n="Protestant" type="religion">Protestant</rs> Episcopal be stricken out. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="730"/> <persName n="Williams,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00375" reg="mostcommon:Williams,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Williams</surname></persName> argued that if you strike out <rs n="Protestant" type="religion">Protestant</rs>, you march more than half-way towards <placeName reg="Rome, Floyd, Georgia" key="tgn,2024102">Rome</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="731"/>When changes of this sort were proposed, there must be some reason for them. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="732"/> <persName n="Pearce,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00376" reg="nearbymention:Pearce,George,A.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Pearce</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Alabama" key="tgn,7002659">Alabama</placeName>, said that the term <rs n="Protestant" type="religion">Protestant</rs> Episcopal originated in <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, to distinguish it from the <rs type="place">Romish Church</rs> there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="733"/>It was attached to the <rs type="place">Church</rs> by the merest accident. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="734"/> Bishops <placeName reg="Otey shop">Otey</placeName> and <placeName reg="Davis shop">Davis</placeName> entered into some explanations of their previous remarks. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/>The question was called for. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/> Pending the call, <persName n="Wilmer,Doctor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00378" reg="mostcommon:Wilmer,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Doctor">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Wilmer</surname></persName>, of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, expressed his desire to cut short the whole discussion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>He was for adapting the old Constitution and Canons to the altered circumstances of the <rs type="place">Church</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>He would move at the proper time to substitute it for the <num value="1">one</num> now proposed. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>He implored his brethren to pause and consider well the results of the contemplated action.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>They might give aid and comfort to their enemies, and inflict incurable wounds upon their friends, whose affections they might alienate and whose support they might loss. </p>
