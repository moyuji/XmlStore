<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/> --This redoubtable Federal warrior, who is still growling like a sick bear over his captivity and disgrace at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName>, indites a letter from <placeName reg="Charleston, Kanawha, West Virginia" key="tgn,7013583">Charleston</placeName> to New York, in which he complains that the prisoners were not properly treated in <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>: that they were subjected to the idle and offensive curiosity of spectators; that they had no opportunities of air and exercise, and, finally, what <persName n="Corcoran,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00018" reg="mostcommon:Corcoran,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Corcoran</surname></persName> evidently considers the climax of cruelty, that no <num value="1">one</num> offered them any <q>&#x0022;spiritual consolation.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/> We confess ourselves deeply pained by these prison revelations of <persName n="Corcoran,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00019" reg="mostcommon:Corcoran,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Corcoran</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>That an officer of his rare merits and a gentleman of his high social position should be treated with such indignities is a scandal to the <num value="19" type="ordinal">Nineteenth</num> Century.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Well may he gibe at <q>&#x0022;<placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> hospitality,&#x0022;</q> which has so signally failed to know a <q>&#x0022;true <rs type="role2">Prince</rs> by instinct,&#x0022;</q> and permitted a peerless scion of <name>British</name> peerage, and blooming flower of Federal chivalry, to pine and almost perish for the want of <q>&#x0022;air, exercise and spiritual consolation.&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/> It is an ancient saying, <q>&#x0022;Put a beggar on horseback, and he'll ride to the devil,&#x0022;</q> and a more illustrious example of the truth of the problem was never seen or heard of than this same <persName n="Corcoran,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00020" reg="mostcommon:Corcoran,nomatch:0"><surname>Corcoran</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Who is the man?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Who is this fellow that gives himself more airs than <persName><roleName n="Prince">Prince</roleName> <foreName>Albert</foreName></persName>, (whom <persName n="Corcoran,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00021" reg="mostcommon:Corcoran,nomatch:0"><surname>Corcoran</surname></persName> refused to honor by calling out his regiment when the <rs>Prince</rs> visited New York?) Tell it not in <placeName reg="Parsons, Sullivan, Missouri" key="tgn,2569713">Gath</placeName> &mdash; he is an ex-policemen of <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName>, the lowest and most servile tool that the <rs>British Government</rs> employs for its meanest work in that or any other of its dominions.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>He came to New York, and improved his condition by setting up a dram-shop, which was liberally patronized by the neighborhood politicians.--This is the fellow who now figures as <rs type="role2">Colonel</rs>, and who makes more noise in the papers than any and all of the gentlemen of the regular service who have been taken prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>It must be the most mortifying circumstance in the captivity of those officers that they have to herd with such loafers and humbugs as <persName n="Corcoran,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00022" reg="mostcommon:Corcoran,nomatch:0"><surname>Corcoran</surname></persName>, and to be represented in the press and public estimation by such a miserable counterfeit of an officer and a gentleman. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> We really feel ashamed to waste so many words on a man who, in his own country, would never have presumed to stand with his hat on in the presence of the humblest of the neighboring gentry, but his taunt about <q>&#x0022;<placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> hospitality&#x0022;</q> seems to demand some comment.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>It is a great want of humanity that, when people are here who proclaimed in advance their intention to ravage the whole land, defile its hearth stones, and exterminate the whole race, we do not board them at the <rs>Exchange</rs>, feed them on oysters and champagne, and give them the freedom of the city ! We acknowledge our shortcomings with all humility.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/>We have failed most egregiously in the only kind of hospitality that such wretches demand or could appreciate, and that was, as we could not afford to furnish them with all the comforts due their exalted worth and character, to send them to a world where they would be sure of receiving their reward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>If <persName n="Wise,Governor,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00023" reg="mostcommon:Wise,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Governor">Gov.</roleName> <surname>Wise</surname></persName> had hung old <persName n="Brown,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00024" reg="default:Brown,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Brown</surname></persName> on sight, it would have saved a good deal of bother afterwards; and if the <rs>South</rs>, invaded by an army which brought with it handcuffs and halters, and threatened rebels, from the <rs>President</rs> down, with the gallows, had treated the prisoners of that army with a taste of their own medicine, the war would be now approaching its end. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> As to <persName n="Corcoran,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00025" reg="mostcommon:Corcoran,nomatch:0"><surname>Corcoran</surname></persName>'s lament about <q>&#x0022;spiritual&#x0022;</q> consolation, if he does not mean <q>&#x0022;spirituous,&#x0022;</q> he manufactures sheer falsehood when he says that nothing of the kind was offered till he reached <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The pions and exemplary <rs type="role">Bishop</rs> of his church in this Diocese, with a zeal which acts upon the presumption that every human form has a soul in it, visited <persName n="Corcoran,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00026" reg="mostcommon:Corcoran,nomatch:0"><surname>Corcoran</surname></persName> in prison, and was anxious to rescue him as a brand from the burning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/>But he was met with such a torrent of abuse of the <rs>South</rs>, its cause, and its people, and such an evident determination to convert a visit of a purely spiritual character into an occasion of political objurgation and vituperation, that he was forced to shake the dust of the prison from his feet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>If <persName n="Lynch,Bishop,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00027" reg="mostcommon:Lynch,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Bishop">Bishop</roleName> <surname>Lynch</surname></persName> has met with any better success, of which we have no proof but <persName n="Corcoran,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="mostcommon:Corcoran,nomatch:0"><surname>Corcoran</surname></persName>'s word, it shows that captivity is gradually bringing him to his senses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>But we advise <persName n="Lynch,Bishop,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="mostcommon:Lynch,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Bishop">Bishop</roleName> <surname>Lynch</surname></persName> not to be too sanguine of the new penitent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>An old sinner like <persName n="Corcoran,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00030" reg="mostcommon:Corcoran,nomatch:0"><surname>Corcoran</surname></persName>, an ex-Queen's policeman in <placeName key="tgn,7001181" n="1.000 212" reg="eire">Ireland</placeName>, and a veteran bar-keeper for <placeName reg="Tammany Hall">Tammany Hall</placeName> in New York, must be, morally speaking, an Augean stable, and cannot be cleaned out in a day. He is <num value="1">one</num> of those <q>&#x0022;lewd fellows of the baser sort,&#x0022;</q> graphically described in the sacred records, who need to be burned to a red heat, like a foul tobacco pipe, in the hottest fires of penance, before any cleanly and honest man can admit them to his company. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>The river is visible up and down for a distance of <num value="15">fifteen</num> or <measure n="20miles" type="distance">twenty miles</measure>, bordered by the shores of <placeName reg="Virginia" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> and <placeName reg="Maryland" key="tgn,7007516">Maryland</placeName>, between which the river, running through some bold headlands, curves out of sight.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>A few evenings ago a schooner passed the batteries and succeeded in getting up the river, although injured in several places.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>The batteries fired heavily, sending only an occasional shot from each.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/> Life in <placeName reg="Dumfries, Prince William, Virginia" key="tgn,7013623">Dumfries</placeName> is by no means interesting at any time, and the past few days have proved unaccountably dull.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>Occasionally a rumor from the enemy produces a flutter of excitement, which soon subsides; and a few shots from the batteries craw a crowd upon the hills.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>The days are long, the nights are very long; and <num value="1">one</num> can hardly wonder that the old inhabitants have gone into more cheerful groves, or sought other and better homes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>A shoulder of mutton, a few boxes of sardines, some fresh fish, and other meagre <hi rend="italics">at ceteras.</hi> constituted the entertainment, while the orchestra consisted of a good-natured volunteer who played the fiddle.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>But, as rude as everything appeared, the evening passed pleasantly enough; for fresh, young hearts and youthful spirits are not hard to please. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="342"/>What transpired during the session, I, of course, cannot with propriety report, further than this, that the only question debated was whether the trial of <persName n="Littleton,,John,K.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00249" reg="default:Littleton,John,K.,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <foreName>K.</foreName> <surname>Littleton</surname></persName> shall now proceed or be longer deferred.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="654"/>The <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> arsenals are destitute of the material which would now be invaluable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="655"/>From all sides comes cries to the <orgName n="Navy Department" type="department">Navy Department</orgName> for heavy guns, and sea service mortars.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="656"/>The Department has not got them, but all hands are working away to supply, and in <rs type="role">Mr.</rs> <rs n="Fox" type="nativeamerican">Fox</rs>, the <rs type="role" reg="assistant-Secretary">assistant Secretary</rs>, the <rs>Government</rs> has an officer of ability, good sense, vigor, and resolution, who can do anything but improvise <orgName n="Heavy Artillery" type="artillery">heavy artillery</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="657"/>So it is that the want of sea service mortars offers at this time an impediment to the establishment of batteries on the <rs>Maryland</rs> side of the river, to shell the <rs>Confederates</rs> out of their works, which could be done easily. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="658"/> The range is not long, <measure n="10inch" type="distance">10 inch</measure> and <measure n="13inch" type="distance">13 inch</measure> mortars, being from <num value="2000">2,000</num> to <measure n="4000yards" type="distance">4,000 yards</measure>, and as yet the <rs>Confederates</rs> have only used guns of small calibre rifled indeed, not adapted to do much damage by their shot and shell to shipping.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="659"/>But the batteries are to be made, and the expedition which sailed from <placeName key="tgn,7013303" n="1.000 493" reg="annapolis, anne arundel, maryland">Annapolis</placeName> yesterday will probably find a diversion in store for it about Accotinck and Pohick, which are to be seen, I trust, on the maps, a few miles below <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName> and <placeName reg="Fort Vernon">Fort Vernon</placeName>--<rs n="Creek" type="nativeamerican">creeks</rs> of the <rs>Potomac</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="660"/>It will have been observed that although the policy of the <rs>Federalist Government</rs> is necessarily aggressive, seeking to recover that which had been fast, their measures have been nearly all dictated to the <rs>Government</rs> of the <rs>Confederates</rs> from the time they stood on the defensive at <placeName key="tgn,2096786" n="1.000 14" reg="sumter, sumter, south carolina">Sumter</placeName>, rallied around <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, and concentrated at <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName>, down to this moment, when it occurs to them that it would be rather a desirable thing to prevent the <rs>Potomac</rs> being quite closed up, the danger and probability of which must have struck any <num value="1">one</num>, as they did me, when I wrote long ago on the subject.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="661"/>And here it may be said that the <rs>Confederates</rs> have not exhibited either much wisdom or vigor in their proceedings. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="662"/> Had they established the work and armed them with heavy guns <measure n="2months" type="date">two months</measure> ago the difficulties of getting the <name>Federalist</name> army in order would have proved much greater, and the inconvenience to the capital would have been accumulated of certain kinds, the army is in such force that a corps can be spared down there for land operations, above all the heavy is now in a state to afford a few gunboats and steam sloops to resist the attempt to close up the river, which could have been effected, supposing the <rs>Confederates</rs> had the means, a few weeks ago with ease and impunity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="663"/>Light rifled guns are not the articles for such work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="664"/>Perhaps the <rs>Confederates</rs> have no heavy guns to spare.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="665"/>At all events, the firing here proves there is little or no harm to shipping in those fine rifled bolts, for they cut through without shattering what is opposed to their flight and <q>&#x0022;nobody is hurt&#x0022;</q> on board.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="666"/>The Confederates rarely fire on vessels going down the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="667"/>Therefore, when the safe passage of a flotilla of schooners is reported the papers set up a cry of joy, and declare that the river is not closed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="668"/> It is the policy of the enemy to let all ships go down that are not vessels of war, for <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName> can send out little just now.--But vessels coming up are obstructed as far as possible, and though a small craft now and than runs the fire, or is tugged up, the effect of the batteries at this moment actually is to bring up a whole armada, laden with coal, fact, fish, vegetables, hay, corn, and provisions, in the various broad bends of the lower part of the river.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="669"/>When the <rs>Pensacola</rs>, which is now lying off <placeName reg="Alexandria, Alexandria, Virginia" key="tgn,7013269">Alexandria</placeName>, is ready to go down, we may hear of a severe encounter with the batteries on shore; but it will rejoice our own naval authorities to know that the engines of that vessel have proved a complete failure, and that it will be a fortnight before she can move her powerful armament to meet the <name>Whitworths</name> or other rifled ordnance of the <rs>Confederates</rs>.
