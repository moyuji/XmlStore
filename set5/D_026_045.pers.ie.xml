<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>From certain facts coming to the knowledge of our authorities they caused as investigation to be made which led to her arrest. </p> </q><bibl n="Philadelphia Inquirer"></bibl></cit>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/>The defendant claims to be an English subject.
