<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> The charge against these clergymen in general is, that they refused to pray for the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>--<unclear>L e.,</unclear> they, on being ordered by <persName n="Butler,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00014" reg="nearbymention:Butler,Gen,,,"><surname>Butler</surname></persName> to use the prayer in the <rs>Episcopal</rs> service known as the prayer for the <rs>President</rs> and Government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, refused to obey.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>For this they were apprehended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Of course, true patriotism rests on nothing of the kind, but justice requires that something should be done.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>No clergyman or ether good citizen will leave his country the less whether any steps are taken to redress these wrongs or not; but it is the duty of those in power to use every means to guard and protect those who have fallen into the hands of a Godless Government. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="203"/> It is related of the famous battle between the <num value="2">two</num> Kukenny cats, that when it was over there was nothing left of them but their tails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="204"/>It may be doubted whether modern tactics admit of such inveteracy; but if they do, we should think the war raging between those ancient fossils whom we have designated above would have a similar termination. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="205"/> The Northern papers almost to a paper have taken the part of old Fuse and Feathers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="206"/>They abuse poor old <q>&#x0022;Pub.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="207"/>Fune.&#x0022;</q> without stint or merely.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="208"/>Yet in no <num value="1">one</num> instance do they undertake to controvert a single statement he has made, or to contest the genuineness of that proof under his own hand which he has brought to bear upon the veracity or short memory of his adversary.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="209"/>They are, indeed, extremely cautious of coming to particulars, and take care to deal only in general abuse. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="210"/> For instance, <persName n="Buchanan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00144" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,James,,,:1"><surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> says that he had only <num value="400">four hundred</num> men at his disposal to reinforce the <num value="9">nine</num> forts which <persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00145" reg="mostcommon:Scott,nomatch:0"><surname>Scott</surname></persName> thinks it criminal to have neglected reinforcing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="211"/>Doesn't <num value="1">one</num> of his vilifiers deny this statement?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="212"/>If it is false, it is very easy to prove it so by the record, and it becomes those who abuse him to produce that proof if they can. But not a man has attempted it. There stands the statement unassailed, and even unapproached.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="213"/>It must, therefore, be taken for granted; for it is evident that it would have been impeached if it could have been.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="214"/>His assailants are very discreet.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="215"/>They content themselves with abuse, and attempt not to controvert. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="216"/> Again, <persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00146" reg="mostcommon:Scott,nomatch:0"><surname>Scott</surname></persName> thought it criminal in <persName n="Buchanan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00147" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,James,,,:1"><surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> not to have sent the reinforcements designed for <placeName key="tgn,7013582" n="1.000 46" reg="charleston, charleston, south carolina">Fort Sumter</placeName> in the <rs>Brooklyn</rs>, or some other ship of war, instead of the <orgName n="Star of the West" type="newspaper">Star of the West</orgName>, a mere passenger vessel.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="217"/><persName n="Buchanan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00148" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,James,,,:1"><surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> publishes an extract from <num value="1">one</num> of his own letters to show that <hi rend="italics">he</hi> (<persName n="Scott,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00149" reg="mostcommon:Scott,nomatch:0"><surname>Scott</surname></persName>) was the adviser on the occasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="218"/>He not only advised, but he gave elaborate reasons for his advice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="219"/>Ease any <num value="1">one</num> of his assailants attempted to ward off the effect of this disclosure?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="220"/>Not <num value="1">one</num>, so far as we have seen.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="221"/>The fact was too stubborn to be grappled with, and it was probably judged best not to attempt it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="222"/> These <num value="2">two</num> instances are sufficient, But, in fact, the whole letter of <persName n="Buchanan,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00150" reg="mostcommon:Buchanan,James,,,:1"><surname>Buchanan</surname></persName> is full of such.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="223"/>Old Fuss is, indeed, the most unfortunate of men in his paper wars, however he may have succeeded in wars of another description.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="224"/>His admirers claim for him that, like <persName n="Marlborough,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00151" reg="mostcommon:Marlborough,nomatch:0"><surname>Marlborough</surname></persName>, he never drew his sword but to conquer.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="225"/>His detractors assert that he never took up his pen but to be vanquished &mdash; It makes but little difference who his secretary may be, whether <persName n="Jackson,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00152" reg="nearbymention:Jackson,Robert,H.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Jackson</surname></persName> or <persName n="Marcy,Secretary,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00153" reg="mostcommon:Marcy,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Secretary">Secretary</roleName> <surname>Marcy</surname></persName>, whether <persName n="Davis,,Jefferson,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00154" reg="default:Davis,Jefferson,,,"><foreName n="Jefferson">Jeff.</foreName> <surname>Davis</surname></persName> or <persName n="Buchanan,,James,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00155" reg="default:Buchanan,James,,,"><foreName>James</foreName> <surname>Buchanan</surname></persName>; the result is invariably the same.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="226"/>His opponent is sure to make the feathers fly, and old Fuss comes out of the scrape picked as clean as the jackdaw in the fable, when he had dressed himself in the plumage of the peacock.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="227"/>He had best confine himself to his favorite amusements of taking the oath of allegiance some half dozen times a day, and telling his rattlesnake stories after dinner.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="228"/><q>&#x0022;Fuss&#x0022;</q> was never meant for an author.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="229"/>We do not think there can be a more indisputable proposition than that. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1>
