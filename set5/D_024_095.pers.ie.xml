<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>For half an hour, while our vessels were in the position I have described, the commanding was of the meat awfully grand and terrible character.

<head>The supplies.</head> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="267"/> The opinion expressed in this journal a few days since with reference to the supplies is in course of confirmation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="268"/>They are increasing and must still further be increased by the improving reads and the new policy of the <rs>Government</rs>, in relaxing the rigors of impressment and obstructions to transportation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="269"/>Prices have receded, and must drop down lower.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="270"/>This will benefit people and Government.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="271"/>Quotations reduced here must be followed by a reduction everywhere.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="272"/>Holders for higher prices must let go their stocks.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="273"/>It will be suicide to hold in the face of a decline which is forced by the evident fact that there is a great deal more of all the necessaries of life &mdash; of bread and meat and forage &mdash; in the country than speculators either themselves believed or made the people believe.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="274"/>We are to have large supplies from productive districts held for many months by the enemy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="275"/>They will be taken chiefly for the army, but will diminish the drafts of the army upon other districts, which will have so much the more for the citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="276"/>It is to be hoped that the ensuing seasons will be favorable.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="277"/>If so, the increased production, under the determination of the farmers to multiply their crops of breadstuffs, and curtail those of tobacco and cotton, will improve the condition of the country generally.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="278"/>The army will in that case have an abundant supply, and so will the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="279"/>Prices will at least be comparatively moderate, and a wise policy of taxation by the <orgName n="Confederate Government" type="org">Confederate Government</orgName> will keep them down greatly below the mad and ruinous rates which have for some months prevailed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="280"/>The reckless career of trade for a time past threatened the <rs>Government</rs> and people with dreadful evils &mdash; the people and the army with want, and Government and people with the repudiation of the public debt. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="281"/> Government credit is better, price of necessaries are lower.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="282"/>The tide has changed, and let us hope permanently.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="283"/>Every citizen ought to exert his influence to make it so. It must be a poor satisfaction to a man to get an excessive price for his produce when he knows that his country and his Government must suffer to the extend of the gain to him beyond a reasonable and fair compensation for the results of his labor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="284"/>Wealth built up in this way must be unsubstantial and fleeting, if there is any truth in morality or religion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="285"/>The wise man should not desire it; the patriot should despise it. All should combine to bring back the country and commerce to a rational basic add a healthy condition--<num value="1">one</num> in which we may live and let live &mdash; in which the interests of people and Government may be best protected, and, above all the highest efficiency and success be imparted to the national cause, on which depends our only hope for independence and every blessing is insures. </p> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="287"/>Our limited space has excluded it from our columns, a circumstance not much regretted by us however, as the war of words indulged by the parties to it can afford no gratification, we suppose, to our readers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="288"/>The <rs>Generals</rs> on our side had, in their official intercourse with the enemy, maintained a hearing honorable to themselves and worthy of the nation they represented.
