<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>That our armies didn't meet with success; that <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName> was not taken, <placeName reg="Charleston, Charleston, South Carolina" key="tgn,7013582">Charleston</placeName>, nor <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>; that the <rs>Mississippi</rs> was not open, and would not be as long as there was cotton to sell or contractors to reward.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>He said, in regard to the rebuke of the <name>Administration</name> at the last fall election, that no more volunteers could be had; that the <name>Administration</name> had to resort to the <rs>French</rs> conscription act; that he would not counsel resistance to the military or civil law, for that was not needed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>That a people were unworthy to be freemen who would submit to such encroachments on their liberties. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/> Q.--What encroachment did he refer to? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/> A.--He was speaking of the <name>Conscription</name> act.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/> A.--He said the <rs n="General Order 38" type="misc">General Order No. 38</rs> was a usurpation of power; that he despised it, spit upon it, trampled it under his feet; that he, for <num value="1">one</num>, would not regard it.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/> Q.--Do you remember anything he said with reference to the course he advised the people to pursue? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/> A.--He said these proclamations and military orders were intended to intimidate the people, and prevent them from mingling together, as they were doing that day; that he claimed the right to diseuse and criticise the actions of the civil and military officers of the <rs>Government</rs>. </p> <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/> Q.--Did he advise the people to take any steps? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="111"/> A.--He advised them, at the close of his speech, to come up together at the ballot-box and hurt the tyrant from his throne.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>I can't remember that he used the language of the question, or the substance of it as stated. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/> Q.--Did I not say that my authority to speak to the people in public assemblages, on all public questions, was not derived from <rs n="General Order 38" type="misc">General Order No. 38</rs>, but <rs n="General Order 1" type="misc">General Order No. 1</rs>, the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, <persName n="Washington,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00136" reg="nearbymention:Washington,George,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName> commanding? </p>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="129"/> A.--I was present, as <num value="1">one</num> of the speakers; I heard the whole of the speech; I stood on the platform, near him, so that I could not fail to hear all that he said; I have not heard him speak since the adjournment of Congress, and, as I came in from the <rs>West</rs>, I did not know that he was there; I took especial interest in listening to his speech throughout, and having to follow him, I naturally noticed the topics which he discussed. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="130"/> Q.--Did you hear his allusions to <persName n="Burnside,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00145" reg="nearbymention:Burnside,Ambrose,,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <surname>Burnside</surname></persName>, and if so, what were they? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="131"/> A &mdash; The only allusion he made to the <rs>General</rs> was, I think, in the beginning of his speech, in which he said he was not there by the favor of <persName n="Lincoln,,Abraham,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00146" reg="default:Lincoln,Abraham,,,"><foreName>Abraham</foreName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>; <persName n="Tod,,David,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00147" reg="default:Tod,David,,,"><foreName>David</foreName> <surname>Tod</surname></persName>, or <persName n="Burnside,General,Ambrose,E.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00148" reg="default:Burnside,Ambrose,E.,,"><roleName n="General">General</roleName> <foreName>Ambrose</foreName> <foreName>E.</foreName> <surname>Burnside</surname></persName>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="132"/> Q &mdash; Was any epithet applied to him during the speech? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="133"/> A.--No, sir.

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="136"/> A.--The only reference that was made to that order was something to this effect: That he didn't recognize (I don't know that I can quote the language) <rs n="Order 38">Order No. 38</rs> as superior to <rs n="Order 1">Order No. 1</rs>, the <rs>Constitution</rs>, from <persName n="Washington,,George,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00150" reg="default:Washington,George,,,"><foreName>George</foreName> <surname>Washington</surname></persName>, commanding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="140"/> A.--I can't recollect any denunciatory epithets applied to that order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="145"/>He bitterly denounced any attempt to make peace by a separation of the <name>States</name>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="146"/> Q.--Do you remember to what, if at all, connection with future usurpation of power he applied his strongest language? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="147"/> A.--I can't say as to the strongest language, for he always speaks pretty strongly.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="148"/>He denounced any usurpation of power to stop public discussion and the suffrage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="149"/>He appealed to the people to protect their rights, as the remedy for their grievances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="150"/>He warned against violence and revolution.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/>By the powerful means of the ballot-box all might be remedied that was wrong of a public nature, and the <rs type="place">Courts</rs> would remedy all grievances of a private, personal nature. </p>
