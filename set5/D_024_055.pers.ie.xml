<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/> If we proceed from this shameless confession of intentions to examine the particular provisions of the bill, we shall find that the structure harmonizes with the plan.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>Every part of it puts fetters on the feet of liberty, while it sets tyranny on horseback.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>In every case of prosecution for false imprisonment, it allows the defendant to appeal from court to court, but takes away the right of appeal from the plaintiff.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>If the sufferer, from wanton acts of arbitrary power, is defeated in the <rs>State</rs> courts, it denies him all address against the misfortune of a prejudiced court or a packed jury, while it treats proceedings in a <orgName n="State Court" type="court">State court</orgName> against his persecutor as null and of no effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>It not only thus outrages the rights of the injured party by this inequality, which would be sufficiently monstrous if the law were allowed to take its course; but it interposes to annul the law on which he relies for his protection, and to insure the infliction of those heavy penalties for bringing a suit. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/> It declares that the authority or order of the <rs>President</rs> shall be a valid and complete defence in all such suits; but as if this was not broad enough to cover and protect the numerous acts of despotism which have been perpetrated in violation of the <rs>Constitution</rs>, it also declares that if &#x0022;there was probable cause for the arrest, imprisonment, or other act complained of,&#x0022; that also shall be &#x0022;a full and complete defence to the action, and it shall be the duty of the court trying the act so to instruct the jury, and that their finding must be accordingly.&#x0022; That is to say, the most malicious stories told by a man's personal or political enemies, no matter whether true or not, are to be &#x0022;a full and complete defence&#x0022; for arbitrary arrests and imprisonments by every deputy provost-marshal, even if he cannot make it appear that he had authority of the <rs>President</rs> for his daring violation of the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="121"/> And the party which passes this infamous, this abominable bill, defying the <rs>Constitution</rs> and annulling all State laws for protecting personal liberty, is the same party that <num value="2">two</num> or <measure n="3years" type="date">three years</measure> ago was passing so-called liberty bills in behalf of the <rs>Northern States</rs> to protect runaway negroes against the provision of the <rs>Constitution</rs> which requires their surrender.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="122"/>So dear and sacred did they profess to hold individual liberty that they would not allow it to be violated even in the person of an escaped slave, and they set up State legislation against Federal legislation for his protection.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="123"/>These sensitive philanthropists and doughty champions of freedom then professed to be shocked at the denial of the <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus </hi> to these fugitive blacks, and made that a pretext for resisting, by mob violence, the execution of a law of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.
