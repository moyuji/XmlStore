Heavy masses of troops could be dimly seen in the grey of the morning apparently advancing towards our lines.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>Some of these approached so near the line in front of <placeName key="tgn,7014404" n="1.000 6" reg="petersburg, petersburg, virginia">Fort Gilmer</placeName> that everything was gotten in readiness to open upon them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>Later in the day they had a grand dress parade in full view of our troops. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>As soon as this was discovered, a brigade of our troops was ordered to advance and feel the enemy's position, and, meeting with such slight resistance, they pushed forward, only to ascertain that the enemy had gone.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>Some <num value="250">two hundred and fifty</num> additional prisoners were taken here.
