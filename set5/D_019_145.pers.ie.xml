<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="10"/> The following is the main portion of <persName n="Parker,Judge,Richard,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00006" reg="default:Parker,Richard,,,"><roleName n="Judge">Judge</roleName> <foreName>Richard</foreName> <surname>Parker</surname></persName>'s charge to the <rs>Grand Jury</rs> of <placeName reg="Frederick, Maryland, United States" key="tgn,7016101">Frederick county</placeName>, to which allusion was made yesterday: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="11"/> <hi rend="italics">Gentlemen of the <rs>Grand Jury</rs>:</hi>--We meet together at a most unfavorable time for the calm and proper discharge of our duties.--War, with its attendant evils, is raging along our borders, and seems each day to be approaching nearer and nearer to our homes and firesides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="12"/>There is not <num value="1">one</num> of us who can avoid partaking of the excitement which such a condition of affairs has aroused; and yet we must be careful, lest under its influence we needlessly trample down some great safe-guard of our liberties, or neglect duties imposed upon us, or perform them in a careless or inefficient manner. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/> Times of war have their peculiar dangers, as well as their peculiar obligations.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>Whilst at such periods every good citizen will rally to the defence of his State, and be zealous to guard her against every injury that may threaten her, whether from within or without, he will at the same time be careful to defend against assault or encroachment all those personal rights which designate us as a free people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>We must also be jealously watchful, lest under some plausible pretext of the public good, powers not granted to our public agents be assumed by them, and great constitutional rights be thereby set aside or impaired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>In a neighboring State, under some such pretext, the great writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus,</hi> devised for the protection of the citizen from all illegal restraint upon the freedom of his person, has by an insolent soldiery been rendered practically inoperative, and the military has thus made itself superior to the civil authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>We fortunately need not dread that so bad an example will be imitated here, for our Constitution has provided that <q>&#x0022;the privilege of the writ of <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus</hi> shall not in any case be suspended;&#x0022;</q> and such was our forefathers' love of liberty, and wise precaution to protect it, that in the <name>Declaration</name> of the <name>Rights</name> which they claimed as pertaining to them and their posterity, though adopted in the midst of our Revolutionary struggle, it is laid down as a fundamental principle of a free Government, <q>&#x0022;that in all cases the military should be under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power.&#x0022;</q> Still this example will serve to show how boldly the most sacred rights may be disregarded by men in power &mdash; and that eternal vigilance is the price that we must pay for the preservation of human freedom. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> What conduct is to be regarded as criminal or otherwise, what men may do or may not do in times of war as well as in times of peace, is plainly written down in our laws.--And whilst we cannot overlook any conduct which is opposed to the requirements of law; so, on the other hand, we cannot hold that to be criminal which the law does not so consider and denounce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>Moreover, all violations of its injunctions can be inquired into and punished by none other than its duly appointed agencies, military or civil, who possess from its grant all the powers necessary for these purposes, and all which they possess at all. The law can tolerate no interference by others with duties it has assumed to itself; but in vindication of its majesty will be prompt to punish every such interference as a high offence against the best interests of the community. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/> Let us not then, whether in times of peace or of war, for a moment forget that we live under a Government of Law; that Law is supreme over all of us, to control our actions even in the height of excitements, to enforce the discharge of duty from the most apathetic and reluctant, and to compel the most turbulent to live in subjection to its authority. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/> In times of quiet, the firm enforcement of our penal laws is found to be essential to the peace and good order of society.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/>It is these laws which protect us in the enjoyment of life and property by punishing all who dare to infringe upon either.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>And it is evident that their prompt enforcement is still more necessary in times of disorder, when men are thrown together in large bodies, removed from the restraints of home and of neighborhood; and when greater opportunities are supposed to be offered for the commission of crime without the fear of detection, from the fact that so large a portion of our most active citizens have been withdrawn from our midst, to repel an enemy, whose tread is a desecration of our soil. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/> To other causes of disturbance let there not be added the want of peace and of a feeling of security about our homes, or any invasion of the rights of person or of property, by any class of our own people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>But let us, at once and decidedly, check any conduct, which at all tends to the further disturbance of society, by every means which the law places at our disposal. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> But I must pass to a more particular consideration of subjects which events now occurring render of great practical importance. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/> As you are aware, our law divides all of fences into <num value="2">two</num> great classes: Felonies, which are punishable by death or by confinement in the penitentiary; and misdemeanors, which are punishable by fine and imprisonment in the county jail. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> And <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> in <hi rend="italics">degree</hi> among the former is the crime of <hi rend="italics">treason,</hi> a term denoting treachery or a breach of that loyalty and faithful service which is due to <num value="1">one</num>'s State, in return for the protection to life, liberty and property that it extends over each <num value="1">one</num> of its citizens. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/> And yet, until within a few short weeks since, what <rs n="Virginian" type="group">Virginian</rs> had even been so much as suspected of a purpose to raise a parricidal arm against the <rs>Commonwealth</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>and the hope and wish of every citizen of the <rs>State</rs>, throughout its whole extent, had been that <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> might ever continue <num value="1">one</num> and indivisible. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/> Now, however, we hear of designs and combinations to divide the <rs>State</rs>, and form a new State out of certain of its counties; and it is my duty to advise you that this cannot legally be done, unless the <name>Legislature</name> shall give its consent thereto; nor can any <num value="1">one</num> hold or execute any office in such new State, or <sic>protess</sic> allegiance or fidelity to it, or under color of its authority resist the execution of the laws of this Commonwealth, without incurring the guilt and pains of treason. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> We all know that the relations which so long subsisted between us and the other States under the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, have been entirely dissolved by the sovereign people of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>; and because of this, the <rs>Government</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> is now waging war upon us. We thus stand towards each other in the attitude of enemies; and our Law declares that whoever shall <q>&#x0022;levy war against the <rs>State</rs>,&#x0022;</q> as if he shall enlist in the <rs>Federal</rs> army, or assemble with others in force to resist the <rs>State</rs>'s authority, or who shall <q>&#x0022;adhere to its enemies &mdash; giving them aid and comfort,&#x0022;</q> in whatever way the same may be done, as by raising troops for their service, or by furnishing their armies with supplies, or by giving them information as to our means of offence or defence, the movements of our forces, or any other treasonable intelligence, shall, upon conviction, be punished with death as a traitor. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> It is further declared to be a high offence, that any should know of any such treason, and not, as soon as may be, give information thereof, to the <rs>Governor</rs> or some conservator of the peace. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/> These laws are stern, their penalties severe, and yet, because of the great interest involved and the widespread mischief that may attend their violation, not more so than may be necessary; and it will be our duty to enforce them against any of our citizens who shall in any way assist the <orgName n="U. S. Government" type="org">United States Government</orgName> in its present aggressive war upon us.--<placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> has withdrawn from the <rs>Union</rs> under the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>Her people now owe exclusive allegiance to her, and none whatever to the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>That she has this right to withdraw, (I speak not of the propriety of its exercise, because that question comes not within the range of judicial inquiry,) has long been my well-considered opinion; I may say I have never entertained a doubt with regard to it. When in <date value="1776-06">June, 1776,</date> our State threw off the <rs>English</rs> yoke, and declared herself a free and independent State, she at once became invested with all the rights of sovereignty.--She has never, so far as I can discover, at any time diverted herself of any of these rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>He people are now, as they were in <dateStruct value="1776--"><year reg="1776">1776</year></dateStruct>, and from that period have always been, a separate people, with every right that belongs to a free and independent nation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>When on <date value="1788-06-25">the 25th of June, 1788,</date> she became a member of the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>, she in no proper sense surrendered or lost any portion of her sovereignty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>Her accession to the <rs>Union</rs> was simply an expression of the will of her people, in the exercise of their sovereignty, that certain governmental potters should be administered through the <rs>Government</rs> at <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>, whilst the residue were to be administered by the <rs>Government</rs> at <placeName reg="Richmond, Richmond, Virginia" key="tgn,7013964">Richmond</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>Not withstanding those grants of powers, it was her indubitable, unalienable and indefensible fight, as an independent nation, to reform, ulter or abolish any government she had established for herself &mdash; that which was administered through the <rs>Federal</rs> agents, as well as that which was administered by her own exclusive servants.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>Of this right she could not deprive herself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>The people of <dateStruct value="1788--"><year reg="1788">1788</year></dateStruct> could not take from the sovereign people of <dateStruct value="1861--"><year reg="1861">1861</year></dateStruct> the great right of modifying, for entirely abolishing, any government which had in their opinion become oppressive or injurious. </p> <milestone unit="column" n="3"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> Then again when our State in <dateStruct value="1788--"><year reg="1788">1788</year></dateStruct> ratified the <rs>Federal Constitution</rs>, she did it with this declaration, which is made a part of her act of ratification, <q>&#x0022;that the powers granted under the <rs>Constitution</rs>, being derived from the people of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, may be resumed by them, whenever the same shall be perverted to their injury or oppression.&#x0022;</q>--whilst she thus announced what was true, that these powers were derived, not from herself alone, but from the people of all the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>--and if perverted to their injury the same might be resumed by them &mdash; that is, by the other States as well as by herself, yet she could have made this reservation for herself alone, having no authority to make it for the people of any other State.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>And as by the <name>Ordinance</name> of the <date value="04-17">17th April</date> last, which has been ratified by the recent popular vote, the <rs>State</rs> has declared that the <rs>Federal Government</rs> has perverted, to the injury of her people, the powers conferred upon it, I do not see how we can question her right, thus reserved, to resume to herself the powers she had granted to that Government. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> You perceive, gentlemen, I speak solely of the <hi rend="italics">right</hi> of the <rs>State</rs>, her lawful power, to withdraw from the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>In this forum we can consider no other questions than those of a legal nature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/><hi rend="italics">The right</hi> being established, it follows that the recent action of the <rs>State</rs> is binding on us all, and every good citizen is bound to give it his full support. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> From my long acquaintance with our own <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName> people, I know that whilst they make no concession to threats or force, they are ever ready to render a cheerful obedience to the laws of their State, and because of this, I have attempted to show that the late Ordinance of Secession was not passed in violation of law, but that the <rs>State</rs> had the legal right to adopt it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/> If such shall become the universal judgment of our people, we need have no prosecutions under these laws respecting treason.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/>The very fidelity that has been displayed in the past, is the strongest assurance that can be given of fidelity in the future. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="151"/> Inasmuch as there are a large number of ministers serving as privates in the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate Army</orgName>, I would suggest the propriety of their adopting a badge, to be worn by every minister in the <orgName n="Confederate Army" type="org">Confederate Army</orgName>, who is not acting as <rs type="role2">Chaplain</rs>, by which they may be recognized by all with whom they may be thrown, as Gospel ministers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="152"/>It is always a source of pleasure for ministers to meet and converse with each other, and under the present arrangement it is not unfrequently the case that they are for many days within a stone's throw of each other, and utterly unconscious of the fact.--Also, they are at times permitted to visit the churches near where they are encamped, and owing to the fact of their having no distinguishing badge they fail to receive that courtesy which is due from <num value="1">one</num> minister to another, and which would gladly be extended them, by ministers and communicants of the churches which they may attend, if they wore a badge by which they could be recognized.--Such an arrangement would also relieve them of the unpleasantness of listening to many paths which are uttered by non-professors, but which would not be breathed were they aware of the presence of a clergyman.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="153"/>Most of Southern men, if not religious, are too high-minded to thus wound the feelings of pious men. These are mere suggestions thrown crudely together, with the hope that others will give their ideas on the subject. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="560"/>There are errors in it, which will be readily detected by the reader--<num value="1">one</num> is the intimation of a possible revolution in the <rs>South</rs>; nevertheless, the article will be read with interest: </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="561"/> We have said, and we now repeat, that the <rs>North</rs> has been deceived and misled into this war by the <rs>Northern</rs> <orgName n="Republican Press" type="newspaper">Republican press</orgName>; and since the war began they have been as constantly deceived and misled in every particular relating to the force, the ability and the courage of the foe. This deception has led to fatal results already.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="562"/>It is now leading us to destruction.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="563"/>The suppression of truths which show the strength and resources of the <rs>South</rs>, the misrepresentation of their financial and commissariat resources, the false reports of their disaffection, desertion, sickness, &#x0026;c., have characterized the editorial and news columns of the papers alluded to, and have so misled the minds of men at the <rs>North</rs>, that the error could only be corrected by some such lesson as was received at <placeName reg="Great Bethel">Great Bethel</placeName>, which may thus, perhaps, be productive of good on the whole. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="564"/> It is beginning to dawn on men's minds that this contest is not an affair of a day, or a month, or a year.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="565"/>If the end is to be the conquering of the <rs>Southern</rs> armies and people, that end is probably very far distant.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="566"/>Let no man promise himself that the <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">battle of Manassas</rs> Junction, now apparently near, will be decisive of the war. If we are beaten at that point, is there any Northerner who proposes to give up the contest?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="567"/>If the <rs>South</rs> are beaten, is there any probability that Southerners will yield the contest any more than we would?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="568"/>They are <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs>, blood of our blood, our brothers, cousins, friends &mdash; and they reason, think and feel just as we should under similar circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="569"/>There is, therefore, little hope of an end of the war by a decisive battle or a short campaign. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="570"/> Another possible end of the war is <num value="1">one</num> that may now be talked of freely, though a few weeks since it was impossible to mention it.--We lately published a very mild letter from a <placeName reg="Saint Louis, Saint Louis City, Missouri" key="tgn,7014444">St. Louis</placeName> correspondent, suggesting a possible peace by compromise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="571"/>The <orgName n="Hartford Times" type="newspaper">Hartford Times</orgName> copied it, and the <orgName n="Hartford Courant" type="newspaper">Hartford Courant</orgName> burst like a thunder cloud on the <rs>Times</rs>, charging them with treason, and flatly pronouncing it to be treason in any <num value="1">one</num> to propose a compromise before we had finished the war!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="572"/>But we are living in cooler times. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="573"/> Another possible end of the war is in the occurrence of another revolution in the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="574"/>It may be that the <name>States</name> which went mad for secession a few months ago, may change.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="575"/>In other words, there may be a strong <orgName n="Union party" type="party">Union party</orgName> there some day.--If we are to believe the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> papers, the <rs>South</rs> has actually a majority of Union men who are held down by mobs.--We don't believe any such thing.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="578"/>But the attempt at coercion by arms has carried them nearly all over for the present.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="579"/>Is there a sane <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> who believes that any amount of physical force will ever prevail to make Union men out of <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> who don't choose to be such?--Can you starve them into it?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="580"/>Is there the remotest hope that a long war will make friends out of enemies?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="581"/>So long as the <rs>North</rs> stands where it stood <measure n="6months" type="date">six months</measure> ago, and says to the <rs>South</rs>, <q>&#x0022;you must yield, back down from all this, and give it up; we will not give you any excuse, any plea, any argument by which to move your doubting friends, you must give up at once&#x0022;</q>--so long as the <rs>North</rs> maintains this ground, just so long the war will continue. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="582"/> We do not believe, if the <rs>South</rs> were successful, and overran the <rs>North</rs> with their armies, that a Northern man would lay down his arms so long as there remained a rock to hide behind while he fired, or a mountain side from which to hurl down stones on his foes.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="583"/>Nor do we believe any less of Southern men. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="586"/> In all wars between equal, or nearly equal powers, the rule has been to ask every thing, but to be content with a small part of the demand.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="736"/> Some of the <rs n="Republican" type="political">Republican</rs> Abolition journals show symptoms of recovery from their war fever.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="737"/>They seem preparing to throw off the hideous nightmare under which they have so long labored with distorted vision and distempered brain.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="738"/>The Times of Saturday is loud in lamentation of the loss of life that must attend a vigorous campaign, and suggests a scheme of peaceable-warlike operations, which seems twin brother to masterly inactivity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="739"/>The Times would have our soldiers avoid the frowning battery and the dangerous redoubt, and is philanthropically opposed to that branch of the profession of arms will calls upon the hero to seek <q>&#x0022;the bubble reputation even at the cannon's mouth.&#x0022;</q> He would have the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander in-Chief</rs> of the <rs>Federal</rs> forces confine his warlike demonstrations to the stomachs of the enemy; and by strategically cutting off supplies, and interrupting communications, starving the seceders back into the <rs>Union</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="740"/> This gleam of human feeling athwart the blood red cloud that has darkened the columns of the <orgName n="Republican Press" type="newspaper">Republican press</orgName> for many a day, however unadaptable, is at least an intimation of a step on the road of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="741"/>But, unfortunately for the human theory of the journal in question, it is applicable to a state of war. The Times must know that, if this cruel strife be persisted in, the best blood of the land must flow in torrents.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="742"/>No course, other than a cessation of hostilities and an amicable understanding, can avert the dreadful calamity.--The sneers and mockings that were out to be indulged <sic>in in</sic> regard to Southern chivalry, have been changed to anxious doubts and gloomy forebodings.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="743"/>The most boastful champion of Northern prowess feels that there is a foe before him worthy of his steel; and no amount of sectional self-esteem can disguise the terrible fact, that when the legions of the <name>North</name> and <name>South</name> meet in the shock of war, such deeds will be done as when <q>&#x0022;<placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName> fought <placeName key="tgn,1000074" n="1.000 10" reg="Ellas,Europe">Greek</placeName>&#x0022;</q> upon the plans of <persName n="Macedon,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00339" reg="mostcommon:Macedon,nomatch:0"><surname>Macedon</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="744"/> The military skill of the <rs>Confederate</rs> leaders makes itself apparent in every move.--Their caution, their deliberation, their energy and thorough preparation, are too palpable to be denied; to talk of starving them into subjection is to argue a gross ignorance of the quiet, yet vigorous pre-arrangements commenced while the world was yet laughingly incredulous of an appeal to arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="745"/>The gigantic scale upon which the <rs type="role" reg="Commander-in-Chief">Commander in-Chief</rs> of the <rs>Federal</rs> forces has gathered in the military resources of the nation, tells the tale; the old chieftain, whose military saga city is not to be misled, is conscious of the vast power of the enemy he must cope with; he knows that the flames will rage with demoniac fury, should the firebrand not be extinguished.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="746"/>The scourge is uplifted Woe to the land and the people when it falls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="747"/>The red rivers that ran at <placeName reg="Waterloo, Seneca, New York" key="tgn,2072981">Waterloo</placeName> will be as streams to the ocean compared with the crimson torrents that must inevitably flow before either action will yield to the force of arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="748"/>The picture of human agony that forces itself up on the contemplative mind, exceeds in intensity of horror all that can be conjured from the past.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="749"/>It seems an insult to human nature to conceive that the promoters of this struggle can face the future, and still cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war.&#x0022; It seems a sacrilegious invocation of the curse of <name n="God" type="God">God</name>, that men, fitted by His grace with the attributes of divinity, should abuse the intellect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="750"/>He gave by prostituting it to the destruction of His fairest work.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="751"/>For the sake of humanity, for the sake of themselves and those they love on earth, let the people look before they leap into the black abyss.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="752"/>In the strange immunity from bloodshed hitherto, while hundreds of <num value="1000">thousands</num> are in the field, has not a <name n="God" type="God">Divine Providence</name> interposed between the passions of men and their better natures, to bid them pause and reflect upon the threshold of the house of mourning they would enter?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="753"/>But that immunity will be of short duration.--What desolated hearths; what weeping brides made widows, what mothers made childless, what sorrowing hearts and untimely graves will crowd upon our annals, should this war go on!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="754"/>From every household will go forth the cry of anguish, <q>&#x0022;Why have our loved ones fallen?&#x0022;</q> From every battle-field the groans of dying men will smite the ears of those whose evil counsels worked the cruel strife.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="755"/>Bearing these things in view, and at the same time knowing that such horrors are not to rust upon us by an inexorable fate but are to be the results of our own volition, it is strange and sad to think that the nation will recklessly invite its doom.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="756"/>But there is time yet for sober thought and judicious action.--The a word of <persName n="Damocles,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00340" reg="mostcommon:Damocles,nomatch:0"><surname>Damocles</surname></persName> hangs by a slender thread, but the blow that severs it may yet be withheld.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="757"/>The soldier's steel may yet be forged into the plowshare, and the ring of anvils may yet drown the battle shout.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="758"/>Let those who would have the right hand of fellowship extended, use every lawful means to direct the course of events.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="759"/>Thus much is due to the enlightened spirit of the age. If the sword is never to be broken and civilization is to be counter marched at every step, better at once destroy the <rs n="printing press" type="product">printing press</rs> and raze the school-house and the church, that men may at least have the plea of ignorance and barbarism to palliate their crimes. </p> </div3> </div2> </div1> </body> <back>
