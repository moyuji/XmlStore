<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/> The more closely we examine the message of <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00028" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, the more we are puzzled by it. His purpose does not appear to have clearly shaped itself out to his own mind; and in his singularly involved, tautological, and ungrammatical sentences, the idea, misty as it is in itself, becomes a mere nebula, which it is almost impossible to separate from the surrounding vapor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>As far as we have been able to make sense of it, <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00029" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> appears to have arrived at his conclusion by some such process as the following.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>The key of the struggle now going on line in the <rs>Border States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/>Whichever party gets final possesstion of them becomes master of the situation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/>But it is impossible for the <rs>North</rs> permanently to hold them unless the slavery that now exists in them is extinguished; and it is equally impossible to extinguish slavery except with the consent of the slaveowners, and on promise of compensation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>It would be worth the while of the <rs>Union</rs> to proffer compansation to the <rs>Border States</rs>, because when once the <rs>South</rs> sees that the <name>Border</name> is committed to the cause of the <rs>North</rs>, they will despair of ever being able to form a compact Confederacy and will surrender at discretion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>Let us, therefore, make this offer of compensation to the <rs>Border States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/>Nominally, indeed, the for me must be held out to all; but it will be sufficiently understood for whom it is <unclear></unclear> intended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>Let us bribe them with money to return to their allegiance; for after all, it is cheaper to buy them than to fight them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>As to the emancipation of the slaves, they may take their own time.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/>It is enough that they <q>&#x0022;take the initiative,&#x0022;</q> they can fix their own time for the conclusion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Gradual would be better than immediate emancipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Let us, then, make an offer to them of buying off their resistance, under cover of a bargain for the purchase of their slaves; and by way of quickening them into an acceptance of the proposal give them a hint that the alternative of its rejection will be a servile war; for all indispensable Means to reconstitute the <rs>Union</rs>, or which may even promise to be efficient for that purpose, shall certainly be adopted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>Lot the masters choose, then, between parting with their human chattels on advantageous terms, or having them couverted into hordes of savage and ruthless <unclear> oes,</unclear> burning, ravaging, murdering, destroying wherever they go, converting the land into a desolation, and every unprotected home into a hell.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>Pressure like this put upon the <rs>Border States</rs> will soon induce them to yield, and these States once ours, the return of the rest to the old Union will be but a question of time. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/> Such is the meaning we in our honest and earnest endeavers to understand it, have been able to elicit from this extraordinary State paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/>The whole matter, however, is so vague and shadowy, and couched in language used in a sense so remote from its ordinary meaning that it is very possible we may be mistaken, and that the next utterance of the oracle may show that quite another thing was intended We, therefore, propound our views with all due modesty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>But, we cannot suppose that it has entered the mind even-of <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00030" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, to buy up the whole slave population of the <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>The war will soon ran up to an expense as high as the price of the <num value="4000000">four million</num> slaves, it is true; and could he now, by a touch of his finger, put an end to the war and all its enormous outlay, there might be some force in his arguments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>But no <num value="1">one</num> knows better than <persName n="Lincoln,President,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00031" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="President">President</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> that while he is debating and negotiating and haggling over price, the war must proceed on its present scale; and his scheme will end not in substituting <num value="1">one</num> source of expense for another, but in keeping both dead weights upon the already overstrained resources of the people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>To guarantee compensation to these States only where the slaves are few, and of comparatively small value, and to make that compensation upon a scale consistent with an apprenticeship or training, of which all we know from the message is that it shall have an <q>&#x0022;initiation,&#x0022;</q> but of which the termination may outlast the present century, this would be a much more manageable affair.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>It is plain that if the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> step were taken the <rs>President</rs> would not be very rigid in exacting the <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>He would be glad to bring about the final issue in any way that would be most agreeable to the tastes and most advantageous to the interests of the masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/>In his eyes the slaves are of no value in themselves &mdash; their importance lies in the use that may be made of them to influence the masters.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>His heart is set upon the <rs>Union</rs>, and not upon emancipation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>If the masters will agree to his proposals-- well, the <rs>Border States</rs> are secured, and the heart of the rebellion is brogan; if they refuse --still well, the slaves can be let loose upon the masters they once served, and ravage the fields they once cultivated.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>True, the end would probably be their destruction; the planters would draw together, like the <rs>English</rs> in <placeName key="tgn,7000198" n="1.000 110" reg="bharat">India</placeName>, and for every outrage committed would take a terrible revenge; but not the less the <name>States</name> would be laid waste, the surviving population would fall unresistingly into the hands of the <rs n="Unionist" type="political">Unionists</rs>, and would afford a strong vantage ground for the subjugation of the remsinder.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="84"/>As a humane man, of course, he would rather that the result were brought about by peaceable means, but if the obstinacy of the planters should frustrate his intentions upon their own heads, be it; he is quite prepared for the darker alternative. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="86"/>The latest accounts represent the members of that body as gathering together in knots, puzzling over the terms, doubtful of its wisdom, perlexed even as to its meaning.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="87"/>If the <num value="2">two</num> houses do not agree to the proposal, as the <rs>President</rs> sagely remarks, <q>&#x0022;there is the end&#x0022;</q>--the matter goes no further.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="88"/>And without some further enlightenment as to the scope of the project, it is extremely likely that they will not agree.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="89"/>They may very fairly doubt as to the extent of compensation to which they would thus stand pledged.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>Whether it is to be <num value="20000000">twenty millions</num> or <num value="200000000">two hundred millions</num>, or even double that sum, to which the <rs>President</rs> proposal to commit them, they can form no idea from his paper.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/><num value="1">One</num> thing only will be clear to them &mdash; that with a war expenditure, large beyond all precedent, and which the succes of this proposition would go hut a little way to curtail, it would be the height of rashness to burden the country with another debt under which the credit of the <name>Exchequer</name> will wholly break down.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>And they may reasonably ask themselves what guarantee they can offer that shall satisfy the <name>States</name> whom it is thus proposed to conciliate that the engagements entered into in the agony of the struggle will be observed at the return of peace, and that natural and intolerable impatience of heavy taxation which always accompanies the return of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>We do not believe that Congress will accept the resolution thus offered to them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>But we do not think that, though rejected, it will have no effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/>On the contrary, we regard its appearance at the present time as full of significance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>It is the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> symptom of exhaustion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>It is a sign of yielding, of despair of the object for which the nation took up arms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>Reports have been current in this country for months past that quiet and thoughtful men throughout the <rs>Union</rs> were beginning to despond as to the issue of the contest, and to long for some terms of accommodation; but that no <num value="1">one</num> dared to utter their thoughts under the reign of terror which prevails.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>A wish for peace was interpreted as sympathy with treason, and would have sent the utterer to <placeName reg="Fort Lafayette">Fort Lafayette</placeName> or to the <rs>Boston Tombs</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>So far we anticipate a unanimous vote in Congress.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>But when the members proceed a further step and discuss the mode by which this desirable event is to be obtained, then will come the time for diversity of opinion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>Under cover of considering the <rs>President</rs>'s project, every man will bring forward his own. The advocates of peace, in and out of Congress have now license to speak freely; they can, at least, say what they do not want, and they will not have much difficulty in intimating what will satisfy.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>And from this discussion, to which the <rs>President</rs> has, in his own favorite word, given the <q>&#x0022;initiation,&#x0022;</q> we confidently anticipate that what is in so many men's hearts will find fell utterance, <hi rend="italics">that the insane dream of a reconquest of the <rs>South</rs> will be exploded, that the hopelessness of a reconstruction of the old Union will be admitted, that the independence of the <rs>South</rs> will be recognized,</hi> and that some more reasonable scheme of boundary adjustment will be struck out than the <rs>President</rs>'s suggestion for buying up the slaves of the <rs>Border States</rs>. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/>All this is, of course, the want of practice, but, whatever the cause, the ships have had it all their own way with the shore batteries.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/>The ships during this war seem to have made up for all their losses in former wars, and to have visited upon the <rs>Confederate</rs> shore batteries all the pummelings they have received from shore batteries from the beginning of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="335"/>The process is to tie the handkerchief around the arm or leg above the wound, and twist it with the stick till the flow of blood is stopped in the main artery.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="336"/>This numbs the whole limb, as indeed do most tourniquets.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="339"/>By a simple adjustment of <num value="2">two</num> plates with an elastic band, the compression on the artery is made and gently increased, stopping the flow of blood, and yet leaving open the other parts of the arm for a sufficient supply through the minor vessels to sustain life and prevent painful numbness, and not unfrequent mortification.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/> A correspondent of the <orgName n="Baltimore American" type="newspaper">Baltimore <hi rend="italics">American</hi></orgName> thus attempts to explain why the ladies are so universally sympathizers with the <rs>South</rs> in the holy cause of independence for which they are battling: </p> <cit><q> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/> It is an undeniable fact that in this community, where a large majority of the men are Union in their sentiments, the sentiments of at least <num value="4">four</num>-<num value=".2">fifths</num> of the gentler sex are on the other side.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>It is also a noticeable circumstance that in all those localities where the followers of secession are but few, you will find that for every male convert who embraces its tenets, at least half a dozen fair devotees are kneeling in humble devotion at its shrine. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/> This state of things has very naturally attracted considerable attention, and has been the subject of much comment, while its origin has furnished matter for speculation both to the public prints and in private circles.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>So far however, no satisfactory explanation of this remarkable propensity which the ladies exhibit for rebellion has yet been affored. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/> Many ascribe it to a patriotic effection for that section of country to which they owe a birthplace and a home, but, unfortunately for this theory, we know how kindly many ladies but comparatively recent arrived from the <rs>North</rs> take to the doctrines of succession and Southern rights, while very few of the <q>&#x0022;Southern exetics transported to a colder clime&#x0022;</q> can be convinced that <q>&#x0022;the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName> must and shall be preserved at all hazards.&#x0022;</q> Human nature being the same everywhere, the rule ought to work both ways. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="471"/> Others think it is owing to a natural sympathy with the cause in which their friends and relatives are engaged; but this explanation will not do, for although every cousin (however distantly related he may be) who leaves for <q>&#x0022;Dixie&#x0022;</q> carries with him to the hostile camp the sympathies of at least a dozen of his female kin, who ever heard of a father or brother restoring a fair rebel to her allegiance by enlisting under the stars and stripes? </p>
