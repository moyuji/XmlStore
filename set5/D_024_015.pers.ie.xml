<milestone unit="sentence" n="13"/>It is remarkable for what it says, and still more remarkable for what it omits to say. <num value="0.5">One half</num> of the <num value="21">twenty-one</num> pages which it covers is devoted to the negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="14"/>No page, no sentence, no line, no word, is given to land, or even to mention, the bravery and gallantry, or even the good conduct, of our soldiers in the various bloody battles which have been fought.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="15"/>No sorrow is expressed for the intended dead.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/>No allusion is made to the maimed and wounded.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>No sympathy is tendered to the sorrowing widow and to the helpless orphan made during the progress of this war, which could have been avoided by honorable compromise, if the <rs>President</rs> and his friends had chosen to do so. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/> Sir, it is a remarkable document.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>It is an extraordinary Message, when we come to think of its sum and substance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>To feed clothe, buy, and colonize the negro, we are to tax and mortgage the white man and his children.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The white race in to be burdened to the earth for the benefit of the black race. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> A friend of mine from <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> the other day made a mathematical analysis of the message.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>He said, <num value="1">one</num> from <num value="1">one</num> and naught remains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>Naught from naught and the message remains.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>[Laughter.] </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/> So far as it relates to the white race that mathematical calculation is right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>So far as it relates to the negro, or in the <rs type="place">Court</rs> language of the <rs>President</rs>, the &#x0022;free <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> of <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> descent,&#x0022; rivers of blood and countless <num value="1000000">millions</num> of treasure are not enough for his benefit and advantage. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/> Now, sir, when our people have anxiously looked to the message from the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> to learn what they have to hope of a restored Union, and a return of the blessings of peace once more to their firesides, by inference we learn, if not directly, that, if we will carry out all the <rs>President</rs>'s plans; if we will carry out his schemes <measure n="37years" type="date">thirty seven years</measure> from now, the people may again behold the restoration of the <rs>Union</rs>, and the return of peace.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>True, the message states at the end of those <measure n="37years" type="date">thirty-seven years</measure> but few of us will then be living to enjoy the blessings we once enjoyed in this now distracted and divided country. </p> </q><bibl n="Hon. W. A. Richardson"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/> But, <persName n="Chairman,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="mostcommon:Chairman,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Chairman</surname></persName>, there are a few pass ages in the message so extraordinary, so wonderful, that they require at least a passing notice.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>There has been, and still is, a great anxiety felt and expressed by our people that this negro population shall not interfere with them; that it shall not jostle them in the occupations they have heretofore pursued in the various industrial pursuits of life in the great fertile regions of the <rs>West</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> on that head uses the following language: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/> &#x0022;And yet I wish to say there is an objection urged against free colored persons remaining in the country, which is largely imaginary, if not sometimes malicious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>It is instated that their presence would injure and displace white labor and white laborers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>If there ever could be a proper time for mere catch arguments, that time surely is not now. In times like the present, men should utter nothing for which they would not willingly be responsible through time and in eternity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Is it true, then, that the colored people can displace any more white labor by being free than by remaining slaves?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>If they stay in their own places, they jostle no white laborers if they leave their old places, they leave them open to white laborers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>Logically, there is neither more not less of it.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl n="The President"></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/> Now, sir, I will not do logic the violence to say that is an argument.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>He tells our people, those who supported him because they believed he and his party intended to keep the nonslave holding States and all the <rs type="place">Territories</rs> on the <rs>Union</rs> for the sole occupation of the white race, if you do not like my plan of disposing of this black race; if you fear, from their introduction among you, that their labor will be brought into competition with that of your own, all you have to do to avoid this competition is to quietly leave your present fields of labor, homes to which, perhaps, you may be attached, and the graves of your kindred and migrate southward, and occupy the places made vacant by the exodus of what his <rs type="role2">Excellency</rs> terms the &#x0022;free <rs n="American" type="group">Americans</rs> of <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> descent.&#x0022; That is the sum and substance of it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/> But, for the sake of argument, admit, if you choose, that all the plans of the <rs>President</rs> touching emancipation and colonization of the negro were to-day successfully carried out, what would it accomplish in the great work of restoring the <rs>Union</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Nothing &mdash; worse than nothing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/> <placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName> recommends in his annual message <num value="3">three</num> propositions to amend the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>I will not trouble the committee with reading them; every gentleman here is familiar with the articles he proposes to adopt for amendments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/>The <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num>, <num value="2" type="ordinal">second</num>, and <num value="3" type="ordinal">third</num>, are for the benefit of the negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>The people are sick and tired of this sternal talk upon the negro, and they have expressed that disgust unmistakably in the recent elections.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/><placeName reg="The President">The President</placeName>'s proposed amendments as a whole, or either of them, could not receive the suffrages of a majority of the people of more than <num value="2">two</num> States of this Union. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/> While upon this subject, I desire to call the attention of the committee to a single feature in relation to these amendments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="49"/>In the message he recommends an amendment to the <rs>Constitution</rs> as follows: </p> <cit><q rend="break"> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="50"/> &#x0022;<hi rend="smallcaps">Art.</hi>--. Congress may appropriate money and otherwise provide for colonizing free colored persons, with their own consent, at any places without the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.&#x0022; </p> </q><bibl></bibl></cit> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="51"/> In this recommendation he seeks to give power to do what he claims he has the power to do without it; and by this recommendation he admits he has been exercising unauthorized and illegal authority.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="52"/>Is not this in itself an admission that the <rs>Constitution</rs>, unamended, grants no power to Congress or the <rs>Executive</rs> to appropriate or use the money of the people for any purposes contemplated in this amendment?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="53"/>He calls upon us to compromise.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="54"/>What compromise is that?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="55"/>For whom does he propose a compromise?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="56"/>What for?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="57"/>In order that you may have more power to advance the negro.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="58"/>That is all there is to it, and there is nothing less of it. He tells us there are difference of opinion among the friends of the <rs>Union</rs> &#x0022;in regard to slavery and the <rs n="African" type="ethnic">African</rs> race among us.&#x0022; He says to all of those who differ with him, surrender your convictions and come to my plan &mdash; and he calls that compromise!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="59"/>Compromise! Yes, I trust in <name n="God" type="God">God</name> the day is not far distant when the people of this country will compromise and save the <rs>Constitution</rs> and the <rs>Union</rs> for the white people, and not for the black people. --Our people are for no other compromise than that. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="60"/> There are other portions of the message upon which I should like to bestow some attention; but I will forbear to do so now, for I desire to call the attention of the committee to another proposition of the <rs>President</rs> connected with this subject. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="61"/> The proclamation of the <date value="09-22">22d of September</date> last, issued by the <rs>President</rs>, took the country by surprise, and no <num value="1">one</num> of the citizens more than myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="62"/>I had fondly hoped and been anxious that the <rs>President</rs> of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> would so conduct himself in his high <orgName>office of <rs type="role" reg="Chief Magistrate">Chief Magistrate</rs></orgName> that I could lend him my support.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="63"/>I have been driven, with <num value="1000">thousands</num> of others, into opposition to the policy contained in that proclamation, for reasons which must commend themselves to every reflecting man sincerely desirous of terminating this rebellion. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="64"/> <persName n="Lincoln,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>, on the <date value="1861-03-04">4th of March, 1861,</date> on the east portico of this <name>Capitol</name>, took a vow, which he said was registered in Heaven, to support the <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="65"/>In his inaugural address, delivered on that occasion he said he had no lawful authority or inclination to interfere with the <orgName n="Slavery Institution" type="institution">institution of slavery</orgName> in the <name>States</name> where it exists.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="66"/>In his proclamation of the <date value="09-22">22d of September</date> last he assumes that he has power to forever free &#x0022;all persons held as slaves within any State, or designated part of a State, the people whereof shall be in rebellion against the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>,&#x0022; thus violating the pledge so <unclear></unclear> made in his inaugural address. </p> <milestone unit="column" n="2"/> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="67"/> If the object of the proclamation was not to aid the rebellion, its effect was. It has strengthened the rebellion by driving into their army every person in the <rs>South</rs> that it was possible to drive there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="68"/>Was its intent to <sic>affect</sic> those alone in rebellion?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="69"/>Clearly not. The slaves of every man in a rebellions State were to be free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="70"/>The loyal man owning <num value="20">twenty</num> slaves, and the man in the rebel army owning a like number, were, by that proclamation, to be <sic>affected</sic> precisely the name.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="71"/>The object of the proclamation was to benefit the negro, not to restore the <rs>Government</rs> on preserve the <rs>Constitution</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="72"/>It was nothing more, nothing less.--It goes a bow shot beyond anything done by this <name>House</name> at the last session of Congress. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="73"/> But again.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="74"/>If the proclamation is to be carried into effect, the war must continue until every slave is free.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="75"/>If every rebel should lay down his arms on the <date value="01-02">2d day of January</date> next, or any subsequent day, and submit himself to the laws and <rs n="Constitution of the United States" type="document">Constitution of the United States</rs>, the war would still have to go on, unless the slaves were all free, for the proclamation declares that &#x0022;the executive Government of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, including the military and naval authorities thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="76"/>It strengthens the arm of the rebellion, and postpones the time of restoring peace to this country, by the declaration for the purpose for which the executive power shall be used.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="77"/>In what respect has our cause &mdash; the cause of the <rs>Union</rs>--been advanced <unclear></unclear> to that time, throughout the great Northwest, you had to but call for volunteers and they rushed to the army.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="78"/>Since then you have had no volunteering.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="79"/>Prior to that time it was not necessary, as the <rs type="role" reg="Secretary of War">Secretary of War</rs> <unclear></unclear> I am told, for I have not read his report--<unclear></unclear> declares it is necessary, to have provost marshals in every county to arrest deserters from the army. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="80"/> We are informed that but a few days before the issuing of this proclamation, the <rs>President</rs> himself declared, in a conference with some gentleman who were urging him to this step, that it would not only be wholly inoperative in the object sought, but would directly weaken us in the border States, but significantly added that it might increase our strength in the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="81"/>I pause here to inquire where that additional strength in the <rs>North</rs> was to be obtained; not certainly from the <rs>Democratic</rs> element in the <rs>North</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="82"/>If additional vigor was infused into the service, it must come from some other quarter which until then had not heartily sustained the policy of the <name>Administration</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="83"/>I need not particularize what class of individuals were to be thus induced to lend their support, the country well knows the baleful influences of this class, and the ends they seek to accomplish. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="90"/>I fear they have not studied the history of the people of this country, or the characteristics of the race from which they have descended.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="91"/>That history, correctly understood, shows that in contests with power they have ever wrenched, even from unwilling hands, fresh guarantees for their liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="92"/>I am led to make these remarks in view of the arrests of <num value="1000">thousands</num> of men in loyal States, without due process of law, by the orders of the executive officers of this Government, at the times and places where, in all cases courts of justice were entirely open, and the execution of the laws wholly unobstructed.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="93"/>The most remarkable page in the history of our race is the fact that while outrages have been committed upon the rights of our people, no resistance has been offered, no violence done, and no life has been taken as the penalty for the wrong.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="94"/>The desire of the people to preserve peace in their own midst has restrained them thus far from the commission of violence. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="95"/> Attempts have been made to intimidate our people at the polls.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="96"/>Provost Marshals have been sent everywhere, and yet our people have not been provoked to violate order.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="97"/>But they are in earnest.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="98"/>They mean to preserve their liberties and their rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="99"/>The results of the last elections were of no temporary character.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="100"/>Such a triumph has never before been witnessed in this country.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="101"/>There is not a man who voted the <rs>Democratic</rs> ticket last fall, throughout the country who is not prepared, when the proper time comes, to lay down his life rather than sacrifice his liberty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="102"/>We may as well understand this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="103"/>Let us talk plain about it. Let us not try to deceive ourselves or others.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="104"/>We are no assassins.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="105"/>We are no law breakers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="106"/>Our people have endured a great deal.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="107"/>They have submitted to arbitrary arrests and imprisonments.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="108"/>But let me say to you, in <name n="God" type="God">God's</name> name, &#x0022;pause, step; you cannot go any further.&#x0022; Our people are resolved that you shall not. They are determined.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="109"/>Do not misunderstand them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="110"/>We are for Union We are for liberty &mdash; constitutional liberty.--Our ancestors, in all times past, have vindicated it; and their descendants, after long suffering, will, if need be, vindicate it before <name n="God" type="God">God</name> and the world. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="112"/>They mean all that they have said.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="113"/>They love the flag, because it represents Constitution, order, law. They do not wish to be slaves, and do not mean to be made slaves.--We have had a bill passed here to-day, under whip and spur, without debate, without inquiry, extending amnesty to those who have thus wronged our people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="114"/>I think you had better also pass a bill extending amnesty to those of you whom the people have condemned for your course here, so that you can have a political resurrection hereafter.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="115"/>That is the only way in which you can ever have forgiveness.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="116"/>If you expect that when the courts come to look at the monstrous bill which you have passed to day, wiping out all the rights of those who have been immured in prison, they will hold it as constitutional, you are greatly mistaken.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="117"/>No court of justice will hold that <sic>that</sic> gives indemnity for the wanton, reckless, tyrannical exercise of power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="118"/>It is not justice on earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="119"/>It is not justice before <name n="God" type="God">God</name> in heaven.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="120"/>My opinion about it is that you had better have left the courts open to our people, and let those men who had ruthlessly and recklessly violated every precept, law, and Constitution, take the legal consequences of their act. </p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="124"/>In all these cases you have violated the <rs>Constitution</rs> and laws.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="125"/>You have disregarded them both.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="126"/>And now you turn around and pass an act of indemnity to all concerned in inflicting these outrages and wrongs.--You have had immured in prison men equal, aye, superior, in intellect to the <rs>President</rs> or any <rs type="role" reg="Cabinet-Officer">Cabinet officer</rs>; men more devoted to the <rs>Constitution</rs> and laws of the country than all of them together.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="178"/> Our commander acted vigorously on the information he brought, and, expecting the landing of the combined forces of the enemy on the <rs>Yazoo</rs>, every effort possible to be made with our resources was resorted to. As was foretold, in a few days the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> fleet of some <num value="34">thirty-four</num> gunboats and rams and about <num value="80">eighty</num> transports appeared near the mouth of the <placeName key="tgn,2784619" n="1.000 77" reg="yazoo river, united states, north and central america">Yazoo</placeName>, in sight of the &#x0022;City of the <rs type="place">Hills</rs>.&#x0022; The following day, at <time value="1oclock">1 o'clock</time>, the gunboats of the enemy had cautiously felt their way to the raft at <placeName reg="Snyder's Bluff">Snyder's Bluff</placeName>, about <measure n="10miles" type="distance">ten miles</measure> from the month of the <rs>Yazoo</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="179"/>There they found a battery, which opened fire, admonishing them that their further progress would be contested with vigor.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="180"/>The enemy threw a few shells and retired.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="181"/>In the meantime the transports had landed about <num value="8000">8,000</num> troops on the <rs>Louisiana</rs> shore, who proceeded down to the railroad, opposite the city, and destroyed the bridges and otherwise rendered the road unavailable, cutting off our communication in that channel with the salt mines of <placeName reg="Lake Bistoneau">Lake Bistoneau</placeName>, which were at that time supplying about <num value="5000">5,000</num> bushels of salt daily to the <rs>Confederacy</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="182"/> Failing to reach any considerable force in their operations, last <dateStruct><day type="name">Thursday</day></dateStruct> week they landed a large body of troops, estimated at <num value="50000">50,000</num>, on the <rs>Yazoo</rs>, at the plantations of <persName n="Lase,Mrs.,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00042" reg="mostcommon:Lase,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mrs.">Mrs</roleName> <surname>Lase</surname></persName>, <persName n="Johnson,Captain,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00043" reg="mostcommon:Johnson,Thos,,,:1"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <surname>Johnson</surname></persName>, and <persName n="Blake,Colonel,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00044" reg="mostcommon:Blake,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <surname>Blake</surname></persName>.--These forces proceeded through the <unclear></unclear> to the <unclear></unclear> border of the swamp from the point at <persName n="Snyder,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00045" reg="mostcommon:Snyder,nomatch:0"><surname>Snyder</surname></persName>'s to a distance of <num value="2">two</num> or <placeName><distance reg="3miles">three miles</distance> below <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName></placeName>, varying in distance from the <placeName key="tgn,2784619" n="1.000 77" reg="yazoo river, united states, north and central america">Yazoo river</placeName> from <num value="2">two</num> to <measure n="5miles" type="distance">five miles</measure>, as the meandering of the stream may direct its course.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="183"/>The bluffs are generally quite regular, running from northeast to southwest, affording a beautiful view of the bottom, which is interspersed with lakes, and the smoke ascending through the tree-tops from the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> camp fires. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="184"/> <measure n="4days" type="date">Four days</measure> in succession the enemy, having advanced to the outskirts of the woods, kept up a continual fire on our lines under the bluffs, embracing most of the distance from <persName n="Snyder,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00046" reg="mostcommon:Snyder,nomatch:0"><surname>Snyder</surname></persName>'s to the <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> mound, only <placeName><distance reg="4.5miles">four and a half miles</distance> above <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName></placeName>; and on <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> last it was evident they had thrown a large force near the centre, with a view of breaking it and coming in the rear of <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="185"/> When <persName n="Lee,General,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00047" reg="mostcommon:Lee,Fitzhugh,,,:1"><roleName n="General">Gen.</roleName> <surname>Lee</surname></persName> discovered their supposed intention, be ordered the <orgName n="Light Artillery" type="artillery">light artillery</orgName> to be in readiness, and withdrew the infantry from the advance line of rifle pits to others at the foot of the bluffs.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="186"/>This had the desired effect of drawing out the enemy from the cover of the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="187"/>Most admirably did the <rs>Illinois</rs>, Missouri, <placeName reg="Indiana" key="tgn,7007252">Indiana</placeName>, and <placeName reg="Kentucky" key="tgn,7007255">Kentucky</placeName> troops (<num value="8000">8,000</num> strong) advance upon our small force.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="188"/>Our brave troops were admonished to hold their fire until the enemy was in short musket range, but their ardor was such, remembering the insults and sufferings endured in their prisons, that patience seemed no longer a virtue, and when within <measure n="175yards" type="distance">175 yards</measure> the <num value="3" type="ordinal">3d</num> and <orgName type="regiment" key="TN30">30th Tennessee</orgName> directed a deadly fire on the foe. The artillery then shared in the engagement on both sides.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="189"/>The enemy advanced gallantly to within <measure n="50yards" type="distance">fifty yards</measure> of our rifle pits, when the well directed fire of our artillery became so rapid, in connection with our infantry, that the lines were broken and the enemy began a precipitate retreat for the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="190"/>The pits could contain our infantry no longer, and they rushed upon the enemy, killing and capturing as they advanced, until they were lost in the woods, where the fight ended, our men bringing out prisoners even there.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="191"/>Thus closed the fight at <rs n="Chickasaw" type="nativeamerican">Chickasaw</rs> Bayou, at <placeName reg="Smith's Bluff">Smith's Bluff</placeName>, on <dateStruct><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> last, the enemy bring completely routed, many prisoners captured, and some <measure n="1200" type="killed, wounded and missing">1,200 killed, wounded and missing</measure>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="192"/> An informal flag of truce was sent by the enemy on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>evening</time>, and our sharpshooters fired upon the troops, who were ostensibly upon the field to take off the dead and wounded, but who undertook <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> to obey an order to secure their artillery and small arms previous to caring for their own sufferers.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="193"/>It was while they were thus engaged in pillaging the field of our rightful inheritance, the spoils of war, that we fired on the vanquished <unclear></unclear>. Our <unclear>humans</unclear> force then advanced to <unclear></unclear> care of their wounded, and they were in turn fired upon by their sharpshooters, when they withdrew with the few wounded they had collected.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="194"/>The wounded <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> brought off by us express the belief that we were justified in firing on them, as they had no right to interfere with anything on the field. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="195"/>The prisoners captured are good specimens of Western troops, and will compare favorably with our own in soldierly qualities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="196"/>The greater portion are youthful in appearance, and it is to be regretted that those misguided Western men should be sacrificed on the altar of Abolitiondom, at the base of the hills on the <rs>Yazoo</rs>, in a vain endeavor to take <placeName reg="Vicksburg, Warren, Mississippi" key="tgn,7018023">Vicksburg</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="197"/>The enemy moved from the <rs n="Indian" type="group">Indian</rs> Mound on <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Monday</day></dateStruct> <time>night</time> to the vicinity of the old race-track, thus extending their lines to the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, a mile and <num value="0.5">a half</num> further south.--<persName n="Early,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00048" reg="mostcommon:Early,nomatch:0"><surname>Early</surname></persName> <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> a force appeared in the fallen timber in front of the old race-track, in the bend above the city.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="198"/>Our artillery on the hills above opened on them as the infantry stationed on the flat along the edge on the timber that has been cut down to obstruct their passage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="199"/>The enemy were, after a couple of hours skirmishing, forced to retire into the woods.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="200"/>Our ordnance on the hills above favored them with occasional shells all day. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="201"/> Since <dateStruct value="---"><day type="name">Tuesday</day></dateStruct> <time>morning</time> it is evident that from the nightly clamor of axmen, the enemy are bridging lakes and making roads to transport heavy pieces from the <rs>Yazoo</rs> to this point on the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, in order, doubtless, to cooperate in a general land and river attack, their right being about a mile and <num value="0.5">a half</num> above the city on the <rs>Mississippi</rs>, and their left extending to <persName n="Snyder,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00049" reg="mostcommon:Snyder,nomatch:0"><surname>Snyder</surname></persName>'s on the <rs>Yazoo</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="202"/> Should the present rains continue the attack on our lines will be indefinitely postponed, as it will be impossible for a land force to operate in the <rs type="place">Yazoo bottom</rs> with artillery when it shall have been saturated with water. </p> </q><bibl n="The Jackson Mississippian"></bibl></cit> </div3> </div2> </div1>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="231"/> The movement of the conservatives in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> is <num value="1">one</num> of the most important events which has transpired in the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName> since the rupture of the old Union.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="232"/><persName n="Richardson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00064" reg="nearbymention:Richardson,W.,A.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Richardson</surname></persName> was nominated by a Legislative caucus of that State, which adopted a series of resolutions denouncing the <rs>Lincoln</rs> despotism in the most decisive language for its suspension of, the <hi rend="italics">habeas corpus;</hi> its outrageous and cruel imprisonment of its citizens in its bastiles without accusation and without trial; its <unclear>urpations</unclear> of the powers of the <rs>Constitution</rs> in many respects, but especially in the proclamation abolishing slavery; and &#x0022;Its perversion of the war into a war of abolition.&#x0022; They further favor a restoration of the <rs>Union</rs> by peaceful means, and, with that object, propose a cessation of hostilities and the assembling of a Convention.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="233"/>These resolutions we publish to- day, together with a speech from <persName n="Richardson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00065" reg="nearbymention:Richardson,W.,A.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Richardson</surname></persName> himself, taking very strong grounds against the despotic acts of <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00066" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="234"/> These resolutions are in themselves important; but their consequence is greatly strengthened by the intelligence that <persName n="Richardson,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00067" reg="nearbymention:Richardson,W.,A.,,"><surname>Richardson</surname></persName> has been elected to the <name>Senate</name> by the <orgName n="Illinois Legislature" type="legislature">Illinois Legislature</orgName>, receiving <hi rend="italics"><num value="66">sixty six</num></hi> out of a <hi rend="italics"><num value="100">hundred</num></hi>--the entire number of both houses.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="235"/>We hope this may be true.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="236"/>The blow, coming from <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00068" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName>'s own State, is a heavy <num value="1">one</num> to him, and will probably suspend his jokes longer than they have been at any time since he has been in <placeName reg="Washington, District of Columbia, United States" key="tgn,7013962">Washington</placeName>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="237"/> <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName> is a powerful State of the great Northwest, whose real interests are just as hostile to <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> as are our own. That she should take this decided stand against the <name>Abolitionism</name>, the fanaticism, and malignity of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, is a sign of the times at the <rs>North</rs> full of significance.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="238"/>It cannot but he regarded as the out-giving of the impatience of the <rs n="Puritan" type="religion">Puritan</rs> rule that must ultimately terminate in a more formidable resistance to it and a separation from that detestable portion of the <rs>Union</rs> which has been the source of all the troubles amongst the <name>States</name>, as it has been of all the new schools of philosophy and religion which have so fearfully demoralized society at the <rs>North</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="239"/> It is true that the men who are making this bold movement in <placeName reg="Illinois" key="tgn,7007251">Illinois</placeName>, and <persName n="Richardson,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00069" reg="nearbymention:Richardson,W.,A.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Richardson</surname></persName> at their head, studiously persevere in the idea of that impossibility: the restoration of the old Union--They could do nothing less than this.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="240"/>But they propose with this view a <hi rend="italics">cessation of hostilities.</hi>--It can hardly be doubted that the ostensible cessation of the war, must be its permanent <sic>denounced.</sic> It cannot be renewed &mdash; at least, by the present parties to it. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="241"/> These conservatives can do no less than praise the old Union and pray for its restoration; but we doubt whether they dream of a renewal of this war even if the overtures for the restoration of the <rs>Union</rs> fall.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="242"/>It is a political sequence of the dissolution that has taken place that there shall be another dissolution &mdash; that the <rs>Northwest</rs> shall split off from the <rs>Northeast</rs>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="243"/> We are satisfied that there has been among <name>North</name> western men a growing hate for <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName>, and a growing respect, at least, for the <rs>Southern States</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="244"/>The generous exhibition of our disposition for a fair and liberal arrangement with the inhabitants of the <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522"><rs type="direction">Upper</rs> Mississippi</placeName>, and for commercial intercourse, deprives them of the only real apprehension of injury from the dissolution of the <rs>Union</rs> which disturbed them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="245"/>To fight hopelessly for a restoration of the <rs>Union</rs>, when they can enjoy all the commercial advantages they ever had without it, is a fully to which their eyes must be gradually opening.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="246"/>On the <num value="1">one</num> hand these benefits are proffered by the <rs>South</rs>; on the other they behold endless taxation to maintain the wasteful <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00070" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> despotism in an unsuccessful war, and the disgusting and arrogant rule of <persName><foreName>Puritanism</foreName></persName> while they remain tributary to the opulence of the maritime power and grandeur of those Eastern States and cities in which they cannot share.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="247"/><measure n="3years" type="date">Three years</measure> of unavailing war, with all its extravagance and horrors, ought to suggest to them this train of reflection, and we shall be disappointed if a brief time does not prove as much.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="248"/>Indeed, we need not look to the <placeName reg="Mississippi" key="tgn,7007522"><rs type="direction">Upper</rs> Mississippi</placeName> altogether for the signs to this effect.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="249"/>The <rs>Philippe</rs> and the <name>Abolition</name> presses of <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> have already become the accusers of the <rs>Northwest</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="250"/>Their own minds have led them to apprehend a secession of the <rs>Northwest</rs>, and they have transformed their own speculations into open accusation of that section, imputing to it such a purpose.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="251"/>Their speculations are just, and so, no doubt, are their accusations. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="252"/> These signs are agreeable, of course, to the people of the <rs>South</rs>, but it would be in the last degree unfortunate for us if, relying upon them, or any other extraneous indication, we relaxed in the least our own zeal, our own energetic and brave measures of self-protection from the hordes which the beastly and rapacious power of the <rs>North</rs> is throwing upon the <orgName n="Southern Confederacy" type="newspaper">Southern Confederacy</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="253"/>The only means of securing our own independence is the sure <num value="1">one</num> of increasing the discord among our enemies, and rendering certain the breaking up of the <orgName n="Federal Union" type="newspaper">Federal Union</orgName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="254"/>This event is necessary to the last completion of that horrid drama now being enacted, by the punishment, the isolation in misery, of that race of men whose villainies have conjured up all the national wars which now fill this continent. </p> </div3>
