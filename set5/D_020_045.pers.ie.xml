<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="16"/> We are pleased to learn that the publication of <hi rend="italics"><persName n="Godey,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00009" reg="mostcommon:Godey,nomatch:0"><surname>Godey</surname></persName>'s Lady's Book</hi> has been discontinued in all of our Southern cities.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="17"/>This was the last lingering parasite of Northern literature that continued, even after the war, to twine around our Southern tree, and suck the vigor of its life away to sustain its own pestiferous existence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="18"/>When we recollect the character and number of the <rs>Northern</rs> weekly and periodicals which used to infest the <rs>South</rs>, we are lost in wonder that such a nuisance should ever have been permitted in our borders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="19"/>There was <hi rend="italics"><orgName n="Harpers Weekly" type="magazine">Harper's Weekly</orgName>, <persName n="Leslie,,Frank,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00010" reg="default:Leslie,Frank,,,"><foreName>Frank</foreName> <surname>Leslie</surname></persName>'s Illustrated Paper,</hi> and the worse than worthless host of the same abominable kind, which was sold at every bookstore and agency in our Southern cities, and scattered broadcast over the whole <rs>South</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="20"/>If there had been no other objection to these things than their entire want of literary merit of any kind, that would have been sufficient.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="21"/>The miserable stuff they were crowded with was enough to nancoato any human being of common sense and ordinary taste, Compared with the <rs>English</rs> literary weeklies, what a contract ! And yet those weakly nuisances were permitted to invade the whole <rs>South</rs>, and make a lodgment in every Southern dwelling. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="22"/> But the literature of the <rs>Northern</rs> cities, shocking as it was, was perfectly beautiful by the side of their morality.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="23"/>Some of them contained Illustrations which were quite in keeping with the contents of the letter bag exposed at the <rs n="Battle of Manassas" type="battle">battle of Manassas</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="24"/>In others there was an insidious vain of abolitionism, radloallam, socialism, red-republicanism, woman's rights, and spiritualism, which was enough of itself to demand their extermination.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="25"/>Now if it be true, as no doubt it is, that the literature of a nation has a more important influence upon its character than its laws, what good will this war do the <rs>South</rs> if we do not provide, by some penalties, against the future purchase and sale of Northern periodicals?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="26"/>There is no other article of Northern production which can be half as injurious.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="27"/>It would be suicidal enough in all consolence to purchase hereafter of the <rs>North</rs> any article which we can produce ourselves, or which can be obtained in any other part of the world; it would be not only ruin to our independence, but foul ingratitude to our noble dead, thus to surrender the fruits of their matchless valor and self-sacrifice; but worst of all, more destructive to ourselves and dishonoring to them would be the continued introduction of Northern literature.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="28"/>What can be, what must be, the literature of those massas who make such private revelations of their real characters in the letter-bags at <placeName key="tgn,2112877" n="1.000 541" reg="manassas, manassas, virginia">Manassas</placeName> ! It is for them, and not for the more educated and refined classes of <placeName reg="United States, North and Central America, " key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName>, that the great bulk of the <rs>Northern</rs> literature is published.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="29"/>The slimy serpents which have so long drawn their disgusting length through the fields and gardens of the <rs>South</rs>, must never again be permitted to defile this part of the <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> Continent.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="30"/>We mean Northern literature ! That which has merit intellectually, and is not patronized by the <rs type="place">Manassas school</rs> of literate, is, in general, tainted with abolitionism.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="31"/>We must have literary periodicals of our own. The South has scholars as well as soldiers, and ought not to look beyond her own limits for our supply. </p> </div3>

<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="32"/> The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> have managed to impress the world with an idea that they are the most enterprising and powerful of all maritime people.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="33"/>We have no disposition to underrate an enemy in any real element of power.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="34"/>Unquestionably, in the whale fisheries carried on by the <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> Colonies, (and which were <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> suggested and recommended by <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Smith,Captain,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00011" reg="default:Smith,John,,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Smith</surname></persName>,</hi> of <placeName reg="Virginia, United States, North and Central America" key="tgn,7007919">Virginia</placeName>, to whom <placeName reg="New England" key="tgn,7014203">New England</placeName> is indebted for its very name,) there was manifested great maritime vigor and courage.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="35"/>In the war of the <name>Revolution</name>, and in the late war, the same qualities were conspicuously displayed by men of all sections, whilst, in common, the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> for a time took the lead of the world.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="36"/>Up to the time of the introduction of steam, the best vessels afloat on the ocean, and the best sailors, were those of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="37"/>Every <num value="1">one</num> remembers that, up to the comparatively recent period of the remarkable victory of the <term type="ship">yacht</term> <rs type="ship">America</rs>, <name>British</name> vessels could not compare with <rs n="American" type="group">American</rs> in speed or beauty.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="38"/>But it is <num value="1">one</num> of the most admirable trait of the <rs>English</rs> character, that it never permits itself to be disheartened by reverses, but, on the contrary, derives fresh energy and determination from defeat.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="39"/>The defeat of the <name n="United Kingdom">British</name> yacht by the <rs>America</rs> inaugurated a new are in <name>British</name> ship-building.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="40"/>The marine architects and the maritime community of <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> were not too proud to learn from a rival, and they commenced at once to build both their sailing and steam vessels upon the model of the <rs>America</rs>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="41"/>It was not long before they had clipper ships that competed in speed with these of the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName>, and steam vessels that were not only stronger and safer then those of the <rs>North</rs>, but as fast.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="42"/>Gradually, as steam became more general, and Iron vessels, especially propellers, were introduced, <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><foreName>Jonathan</foreName></persName></hi> began to fall farther and farther behind <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName n="Bull,,John,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00012" reg="default:Bull,John,,,"><foreName>John</foreName> <surname>Bull</surname></persName></hi> in the great race for ocean supremacy, until at last, every single steam vessel that New York had to <placeName key="tgn,7002445" n="1.000 4" reg="united kingdom">England</placeName> was driven from the ocean.--<name>English</name> ocean steamer lines traversed the whole globe and made every section of the earth tributary to <name>English</name> commerce.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="43"/>Not satisfied with all this, <name>English</name> architects built the <q>&#x0022;Great Eastern,&#x0022;</q> which was the last and greatest of all her ship-building victories, and completed the mortification of <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><foreName>Jonathan</foreName></persName>.</hi>--Alas What had become of the ocean that he had claimed as his peculiar domain?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="44"/>It was in vain that he flattered himself that the colossal structure would prove unmanageable at sea. It was handled as easily as a pilot boat, and it sped over the ocean as gracefully and buoyantly as a bird through the air. The <rs>Great Eastern</rs> is a standing banter to <hi rend="smallcaps"><persName><foreName>Jonathan</foreName></persName>,</hi> and, moreover, it can carry <num value="10000">ten thousand</num> troops in <num value="1">one</num> voyage ! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="45"/> We sometimes think that introduction of steam has produced degeneracy in the naval and commercial marine.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="46"/>Steam does not require the <name>Seamanship</name> that is essential in calling vessels.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="47"/><num value="1">One</num> does not see on board <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">United States</placeName> vessels at this day such noble specimens of physical strong, such genuine sense of <hi rend="smallcaps">Nettune,</hi> as <measure n="30years" type="date">thirty years</measure> ago abounded on every man-of-war.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="48"/>At that time, the <orgName n="Navy" type="military">Navy</orgName> was made up of men who had been oradied and reared on the ocean, and who like <hi rend="smallcaps">Long <persName><foreName>Tom</foreName></persName></hi> <persName n="Coffin,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00013" reg="mostcommon:Coffin,nomatch:0"><surname>Coffin</surname></persName>, saw no use in land anyhow, except here and there a place to drop an anchor in.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>This sentence perhaps may require a little explanation.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>The master poet says, conscience makes cowards of us all.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="385"/> <hi rend="italics">To the <name>Editors</name> of the <name>Dispatch</name>:</hi>--In your issue of the <dateStruct value="--21"><day reg="21">21st inst.</day></dateStruct>, I noticed a piece signed <q>&#x0022;Volunteer <rs type="role2">Private</rs>,&#x0022;</q> and was glad to see that some <num value="1">one</num> had come forward and called upon the militia of the city and county to come out and volunteer promptly, to complete the quota called for by the <rs>Governor</rs>'s proclamation. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="386"/> But in your issue the next day &mdash; the <num value="22" type="ordinal">22d</num>--this piece is replied to by <q>&#x0022;Militia,&#x0022;</q> and feeling interested in this matter of volunteering, I cannot allow <q>&#x0022;Militia's&#x0022;</q> statement to go before the people of the county without replying to him. In his estimate of the number of men already furnished by the city and county jointly, he has evidently fallen into a most egregious error.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="387"/>He says that the city and county together have furnished <q>&#x0022;<num value="3355">3,355</num>, or <num value="57">57</num> more than her quota of <num value="3798">3,798</num> required to be furnished&#x0022;</q> </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="388"/> Now, the error into which <q>&#x0022;Militia&#x0022;</q> has fallen is simply this: In making up his number of <num value="3855">3,855</num>, he has actually included the <q>&#x0022;Tredegar Battalion,&#x0022;</q> which numbers <num value="350">350</num> men according to his own statement.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="389"/>Now, by what right does <q>&#x0022;Militia&#x0022;</q> include <num value="350">350</num> men, who form a <q>&#x0022;<orgName n="Home Guard" type="militia">home guard</orgName> for city protection,&#x0022;</q> and who are daily at work at the <rs>Tredegar Foundry</rs>?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="390"/>Is that the way to estimate the quota required by the <rs>Governor</rs>'s proclamation?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="391"/>If so, I doubt very much if we would not be safe in saying that the <placeName reg="United States" key="tgn,7012149">Confederate States</placeName> have now <num value="500000">500,000</num> men <hi rend="italics">in the field.</hi> Why didn't <q>&#x0022;Militia&#x0022;</q> include the <rs>Ellis Battalion</rs> also?--he could have swollen the number to about <num value="357">357</num>. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="392"/> Now, <persName n="Editors,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00222" reg="mostcommon:Editors,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Mister">Messrs.</roleName> <surname>Editors</surname></persName>, my sole object in writing this article is, simply to correct an error into which <q>&#x0022;Militia&#x0022;</q> has fallen, and which is calculated to injure the volunteer system now going on in the city and county, without the slightest intention, I am sure, on the part of <q>&#x0022;Militia&#x0022;</q> to do so. So, according to his own statement, the city and county together is yet <num value="293">293</num> short of the quota.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="393"/>But his figures are very far from being right.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="394"/>I have been informed by a Colonel of <num value="1">one</num> of the city regiments, that the city has furnished considerably over and above her quota; but from accurate calculation the county is <num value="410">410</num> or <num value="415">415</num> short. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="395"/> I was anxious that <q>&#x0022;Volunteer <rs type="role2">Private</rs>&#x0022;</q> should reply to <q>&#x0022;Militia,&#x0022;</q> but as he has not done so, I determined to notice it myself.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="396"/>If the county is short of her quota, as we are told by the gentleman already mentioned as commanding a regiment, then they should come forward at once and fill up the ranks of the various companies now forming in the city and county. </p> <closer><signed><placeName reg="Henrico, Virginia, United States" key="tgn,1002467">Henrico</placeName>.</signed></closer> </div3>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="421"/>It is alarming to hear men talking of sanctioning an unlimited power, exercised either by Legislatures, or the <name>Executives</name>, or Courts where all our Governments are of themselves Governments of limitations and checks; and of fixed and known laws, while the people are a race, of all others, and most jealous of encroachments upon their liberties.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="459"/> --It has been intimated that a meeting of the battalion of <orgName type="mil" key="HomeArtillery">Home Artillery</orgName>, commanded by <persName n="Ellis,Colonel,Thomas,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00244" reg="default:Ellis,Thomas,H.,,"><roleName n="Colonel">Col.</roleName> <foreName>Thomas</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Ellis</surname></persName>, and numbering some <num value="300">three hundred</num> men, was recently held to take into consideration the fact that they had received orders to prepare for active duty in the field. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="460"/> It will be remembered that the <orgName n="City Council" type="council">City Council</orgName>, some time ago, voted <measure n="11000dollars" type="currency">$11,000</measure>, to be used in buying horses and harness for the use of the <q>&#x0022;<orgName type="mil" key="HomeArtillery">Home Artillery</orgName>,&#x0022;</q> under the supposition that they would be wanted for use. The money was expended in the manner designed, the horses and harness having been procured on fair terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="461"/>It was a knowledge of the latter fact, no doubt, that caused the <rs>Confederate</rs> authorities to supply the battalion with a dozen or more excellent cannon of various calibres, both smooth-bore and rified.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="462"/>It has been said that the members of the <q>&#x0022;<orgName type="mil" key="HomeArtillery">Home Artillery</orgName>&#x0022;</q> enlisted therein with the distinct understanding that they were to be employed in home defence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="463"/>On the other hand, it has been asserted, with an equal show of authority, that when the terms of enlistment were made known to the authorities they refused to commission the officers unless the men were subject to orders like other soldiers, and that the commissions were issued to them with this understanding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="464"/>The Battalion of <orgName type="mil" key="HomeArtillery">Home Artillery</orgName>, as has been remarked, numbered over <num value="300">300</num> men, <num value="2">two</num>-<num value=".333">thirds</num> of whom, it was thought, could conveniently leave home &mdash; certainly could do so with as much case as many who are now on the tented field, and who have freely offered their bodies as targets for the enemy's shot, to aid in securing and perpetuating our menaced rights.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="465"/>Somewhere in the <placeName reg="New York" key="tgn,7007568">State of New York</placeName>, a few months ago, when the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> dread note of war was sounded, the patriotic citizens of a suburban village formed themselves into a <q>&#x0022;<orgName type="mil" key="HomeGuard">Home Guard</orgName>.&#x0022;</q> To give emphasis and effect to the deed, they held a meeting, at which a resolution was unanimously passed to the effect that, having united themselves together for <hi rend="italics">home</hi> defence, the guard would in no event leave home unless in case of an invasion.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="466"/>Rightly interpreted, this was held to mean that, on the appearance of the <q>&#x0022;enemy,&#x0022;</q> the <q>&#x0022;<orgName type="mil" key="HomeGuard">Home Guard</orgName>&#x0022;</q> would <q>&#x0022;scoot.&#x0022;</q> In citing this we are not be understood as applying it to <hi rend="italics">our</hi> <orgName type="mil" key="HomeArtillery">Home Artillery</orgName>, who would no doubt, on the appearance of an enemy hereabout, do their part towards making him pay for his temerity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="467"/>Inasmuch, however, as events of recent occurrence have shown that the possibility of having an enemy very near the city to contend with is an exceedingly bare <num value="1">one</num>, and is getting more so each day, the people indulged a lively hope that the larger portion of the <q>&#x0022;<orgName type="mil" key="HomeArtillery">Home Artillery</orgName>&#x0022;</q> would find it convenient to display on another field those patriotic emotions which were supposed to be rampant in the breast of each individual member, <measure n="10days" type="date">Ten days</measure> ago it was said that the warriors composing the battalion were only waiting for the harness to be used in drawing their cannons and caissons to the field of carnage, when they would be off. In view of their prospective exodus, the reporter had been drawing heavily on his mental bread basket for the wherewithal to do the needful in consequence of so generous a display of patriotic fervor on the part of a large and influential body of his fellow-citizens.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="468"/>A little seasonable regret is not out of place that an <q>&#x0022;unforeseen contingency&#x0022;</q> has nipped the intended demonstration in the bud.--It was ascertained yesterday, from what is deemed reliable authority, that the <orgName type="mil" key="HomeGuardBattalion">Home Guard Battalion</orgName> held a meeting a few nights since to determine whether they would go or stay.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="469"/>The former was proved by the action of the meeting to be alarmingly in the vocative.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="470"/><q>&#x0022;stay&#x0022;</q> had <q>&#x0022;the call&#x0022;</q> by immense odds.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="473"/>Alas, for the uncertainty of human expectation ! </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="474"/> We understand that the horses and harness intended to be used by the military organization above alluded to have been turned over (in part) to the <orgName n="King William Artillery" type="artillery">King William Artillery</orgName>, (a splendid corps,) commanded by <persName n="Carter,Captain,Thomas,H.,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00245" reg="default:Carter,Thomas,H.,,"><roleName n="Captain">Capt.</roleName> <foreName n="Thomas">Thos.</foreName> <foreName>H.</foreName> <surname>Carter</surname></persName>, and that the remainder will be given to another corps, who expect soon to be ordered off. This was the only thing that could be done, as it would not be right to let the horses stay <hi rend="italics">here</hi> and eat their heads off and do nothing. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="475"/> It has been suggested that as there are necessarily a large number of the <rs>Confederate</rs> soldiers who enlisted to fight the enemy, now necessarily detained here to keep guard over the captured <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisoners, that it would be most judicious for the <rs>Richmond</rs> <orgName type="mil" key="HomeArtillery">Home Artillery</orgName> to take their places, and thus relieve them of the merely police duties they are now called on to perform in keeping <q>&#x0022;watch and ward&#x0022;</q> over the <name>Lincolnites</name>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="519"/>But it will not be continued.--The triumphant army of the <rs>South</rs>, now ready to listen to overtures of peace, if they be not proffered, will, in time, dictate peace on its own terms.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="595"/> It is a Dahlgren, extremely heavy at the breach, being something over calibre thick of metal, but begins to taper back of the trunions and tapers quickly to the muzzle, being much lighter, in proportion to the weight of the projectile, than the columbiad.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="596"/>It was cast solid and of <placeName reg="Bloomfield, Stoddard, Missouri" key="tgn,2058082">Bloomfield</placeName> metal, the same used for some years in the manufacture of columbiads.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="597"/>For the purpose of firing, the gun was swung up by iron straps in a triangle, thus avoiding the necessity of correcting the recoil at each discharge, which would follow the use of a carriage mounting.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="599"/>Each pair of uprights is framed at the foot into heavy timbers and joined at the top, in the shape of a letter A, the base spreading nearly <measure n="30feet" type="distance">thirty feet</measure>.
