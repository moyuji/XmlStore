<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="297"/> We observe that the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> are already making great use of the remarks made by <persName n="Foote,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00222" reg="nearbymention:Foote,H.,S.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Foote</surname></persName>, in the <orgName n="House of Representatives" type="government">House of Representatives</orgName>, with regard to the alleged starvation of their prisoners.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="298"/>The subject has been brought up in their Congress, and their press enlarges upon it with all the exaggeration to be expected from the most lying nation on the face of the earth.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="299"/>We deeply regret that the subject &mdash; although it certainly ought to have been investigated &mdash; was introduced by a speech of so much bitterness as that attributed to <persName n="Foote,Mister,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00223" reg="nearbymention:Foote,H.,S.,,"><roleName n="Mister">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Foote</surname></persName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="300"/>From the little we know of the subject we are inclined to think he has gone too far. We have been assured that if there has ever been an occasion on which the prisoners were not properly supplied it has been very brief, and the result of unavoidable circumstances.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="301"/>At all times they have fared as well as our own soldiers, and surely that is enough. </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="302"/> Our soldiers have fared badly at times, owing to circumstances with which all are well acquainted.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="303"/>The <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs>, last <rs type="season">spring</rs> and <rs type="season">summer</rs>, sent bands of marauders into the country lying between the <placeName reg="Potomac and James river">Potomac and James river</placeName>.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="304"/>They reduced it almost to a desert.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="305"/>They destroyed the crops, burnt the mills, shot all the horses, mules, sheep, oxen, and cows that they could not carry off, collected all the plows, hoes, axes, and <rs n="agricultural implements" type="product">agricultural implements</rs> of every kind into piles and set fire to them, and went off, carrying with them all the negroes that could be induced to follow them.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="306"/>The object, boldly avowed by <persName n="Lincoln,,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00224" reg="mostcommon:Lincoln,nomatch:0"><surname>Lincoln</surname></persName> himself, was to starve the population into submission.--Modern history presents but <num value="1">one</num> parallel to the cold-blooded atrocity of this proceeding.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="307"/>The monster Carrier, during the <name>Reign</name> of Terror in <placeName key="tgn,1000070" n="1.000 1012" reg="france">France</placeName>, undertook in this way to starve the people of <placeName key="tgn,7008482" n="1.000 3" reg="nantes,loire-atlantique,pays de la loire,france,europe">Nantes</placeName> and the surrounding district.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="308"/>His orders to that effect &mdash; exactly parallel to the orders under which the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> <rs type="role2">Generals</rs> acted last spring &mdash; were read before the <rs>Convention</rs> when he was tried for his life, after the fall of Robespierre, and they elicited a cry of horror even from that assembly, hardened as it was in crime by long habit.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="309"/>The consequence of these atrocities was a difficulty of procuring food for both army and population.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="310"/>Both of these suffered, and, to some extent, are suffering now. And now, when these <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankee</rs> prisoners are suffering from their own acts &mdash; when they are pinched for the food which their own hands have destroyed &mdash; when they pine for the luxuries which their own infernal malignity has rendered it impossible to procure &mdash; are we to bear the burden of their iniquity?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="311"/>Are we to be blamed for what it was not in our power to prevent?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="312"/>Are we, and we alone, to suffer the penalty of their transgressions?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="313"/>Are our soldiers, who are fighting our battles, to be deprived of food, that they may have plenty?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="314"/>No, by all that is just, all that is patriotic, all that is truly generous ! Let them suffer the penalty of their own atrocities, and thank their stars that it is not harder to bear.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="315"/>We would be perfectly justified in stinting them to <num value="0.5">a half</num> or <num value="0.25">a quarter</num> of the allowance we make to our own soldiers, instead of giving them exactly the same rations that our soldiers receive.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="316"/>If anybody suffer, it is perfectly just that it should be they, but for whose acts, done in defiance of all the laws that regulate the proceedings of war, there would be no suffering at all. It is of the nature of the prisoner's condition that he should share the let of those with whom he is a prisoner.--He cannot expect better fare than that which is received by the soldiers to whom he surrenders.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="317"/>If they pine for want, he must pine too. If they live plentifully, he must be plentifully fed also.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="318"/>If <num value="1">one</num> party or the other must suffer, he must be that party.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="319"/>The proceedings of the <rs n="Yankee" type="group">Yankees</rs> upon this subject &mdash; their speeches and their writings &mdash; go beyond anything they have yet attempted in the way of impudence.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="320"/>They give orders to destroy our country, in order to starve us out, and they expect while they are starving us we shall allow full rations to their prisoners!

<milestone unit="sentence" n="321"/>We hope no man will be moved from his balance by what they say. What care we for the opinion of the world?

<milestone unit="sentence" n="322"/>The world ignores us, notwithstanding the court we have paid it. Why should we care what lies it may believe of us? </p> 
<p>

<milestone unit="sentence" n="323"/> During the discussions which have arisen out of this question, <persName n="Northrop,Commissary,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00225" reg="mostcommon:Northrop,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commissary">Commissary</roleName> <surname>Northrop</surname></persName> has been treated with unmeasured severity.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="324"/>He may deserve it all, for aught we know &mdash; we do not know the man when we see him; he is nothing to us. But these transactions are becoming matters of history, and history will look at both sides of a question.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="325"/><persName n="Northrop,Commissary,,,," id="n-0001.0000.00000.00226" reg="mostcommon:Northrop,nomatch:0"><roleName n="Commissary">Commissary</roleName> <surname>Northrop</surname></persName> has, we believe, filled his present office from the beginning of the war. It is, all must allow, a very difficult office to fill.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="326"/>It must have been especially so at the beginning, when he was raw himself and had nothing but raw hands to operate with.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="327"/>The war has been the greatest and most extensive of which there is any account.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="328"/>The armies kept in the field have rarely ever counted fewer than <num value="300000">300,000</num> men. Since the <num value="1" type="ordinal">first</num> year they have been much larger.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="329"/>A very large proportion of the country on which these armies have been dependent for supplies is either in the occupation of the enemy, or has been so utterly wasted by him as to yield no fruit to us. Yet these mighty armies have constantly kept the field.

<milestone unit="sentence" n="330"/>They have never been forced to abandon it for want of supplies.
